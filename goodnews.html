          <p>Rod Stewart has cancelled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later in June. Stewart expressed his apologies to fans for the inconvenience and assured them of his return to the stage soon. The cancelled dates include shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with plans to reschedule two California concerts. Stewart is scheduled to play the legends slot at Glastonbury, marking his first appearance at the festival since 2002, and has requested additional time to perform his extensive repertoire. The Glastonbury performance will include his former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. Optimism is present due to Stewart's anticipated recovery and future performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement allows each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and allocates $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will be determined based on the sport and length of athletic career, with some players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each. The settlement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and it also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals are pegged at fair market value. This decision marks a major turning point in the debate over compensating college athletes.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with Beijing. This shift follows the impeachment and removal of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, who emphasized stronger ties with the US and Japan. Lee's administration is anticipated to differ from Yoon's stance on security challenges outside the Korean peninsula. During his campaign, Lee faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as occupation forces. Despite potential changes in foreign policy, observers expect continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan.</p>

          <p>Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life, like living to 100, requires more than individual optimization through diet and exercise. Sridhar points out that life expectancy is stagnating or declining in many high-income countries despite increased knowledge about healthy living. She emphasizes the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community in influencing health outcomes and longevity. Sridhar advocates for policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water, arguing that health should be a collective responsibility rather than an individual one.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a multibillion-dollar settlement known as House v. NCAA, paving the way for a new era in college sports where athletes can be directly paid. Starting this fall, colleges and universities in the NCAA's top division will be allowed to compensate athletes, with payments limited by a salary cap initially set at $20.5 million per school. The settlement also includes $2.75 billion in payments to former college athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money. The agreement marks a significant shift from the tradition of amateurism and is expected to transform the landscape of college athletics.</p>
