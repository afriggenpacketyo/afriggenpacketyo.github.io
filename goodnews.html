          <p>Former county cricketer Arul Suppiah discusses his struggles with anorexia, a serious mental health condition often associated with young women. Suppiah's health kick in 2017 spiraled into excessive exercise and restricted eating, leading to social isolation. After nearly fainting at work and a doctor's warning about potential hospitalization under the Mental Health Act, Suppiah began his recovery. He emphasizes that anorexia can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender, and that seeking help is crucial. </p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China, investment banks are revising their economic forecasts for China. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs on each other's products, reducing them from 125% to 10% for 90 days. UBS now projects China's GDP growth in 2025 could reach between 3.7% and 4%, up from 3.4%. Morgan Stanley anticipates companies may expedite exports to leverage lower tariffs, potentially boosting China's second-quarter GDP above the current estimate of 4.5%. ANZ Bank also sees potential for China's GDP to exceed 4.2% this year. </p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the U.S. and China, tariff rates have been reduced, though not eliminated. Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. now face a baseline tariff rate of about 50%, combining previous tariffs with new duties still in force. This reduction addresses concerns about potential product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season. However, the duties imposed earlier this year, citing China's alleged role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis, remain in place. The article aims to clarify the new effective tariff rates and their potential impact on Chinese manufacturers and exporters.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, which initially struggled with interest rate hikes in 2022, saw increased profits in 2024 due to higher net interest income. Companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo experienced significant boosts to their bottom lines. However, as interest rates broadly decline, these fintechs, especially digital banks, face a critical test regarding the sustainability of their business models. Experts suggest that firms with diversified revenue streams and strong customer monetization through non-interest services will be better positioned to adapt to the changing economic environment. </p>

This underground layer could contain as much water as a global layer up to 780 meters thick, potentially resolving the mystery of Mars' missing water. </p>
