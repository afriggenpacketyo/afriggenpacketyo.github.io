          <p>Boeing's senior vice-president, Turbo Sjogren, emphasized the need for Europe to decrease its dependence on China for critical minerals, similar to the U.S. The aerospace supply chain is global, necessitating collaboration, and programs in both the U.S. and Europe will feature significant content from each other. Sjogren highlighted that U.S. legislation since 1973 requires the aerospace industry and defense sector to avoid reliance on countries like China for critical materials. This call comes amid growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for greater sovereignty in the face of global challenges.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed U.S. President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. Modi emphasized India's consistent policy of rejecting third-party mediation, particularly concerning Kashmir. He clarified that discussions on a trade deal or U.S. mediation did not occur between the Pahalgam attack and the ceasefire, with the ceasefire talks initiated by Pakistan. Modi also conveyed that India now considers cross-border terrorism as an act of war, with ongoing operations against terrorists, and the two leaders agreed to meet in person soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manufacturers are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. This practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Companies like Winnebago Industries are working with experts to develop strategies including tariff engineering and deferrals. While not illegal, this act is described as a "clever art of outsmarting customs," with companies making slight adjustments to qualify for lower duties; however, heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation requirements.

During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited, and the return capsule reached its designated altitude, separating cleanly from the escape tower with parachutes deployed.
