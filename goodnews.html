          <p>Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu collaborated with Baidu to test AI-generated avatars for livestreaming on Baidu's e-commerce platform "Youxuan." The digital avatars, trained on five years of video data to mimic their human counterparts' style and jokes, engaged with viewers in real-time for over six hours, generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales. This exceeded Luo's previous livestreaming attempt, which lasted four hours and resulted in fewer orders. Luo expressed astonishment at the success of the digital human effect, highlighting the potential of AI in the influencer marketing space. The performance suggests that AI avatars can effectively replicate and even enhance the persuasive capabilities of human influencers.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation funds.

The ruling prevents the administration from withholding funds from sanctuary jurisdictions. The optimism score reflects the legal challenge to the administration's immigration policies.</p>
