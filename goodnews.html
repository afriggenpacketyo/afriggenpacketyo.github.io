        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court suggested the Federal Reserve board members have protection against presidential firings, while allowing President Trump to remove members of other federal agencies' boards for now. The majority opinion, penned by six conservative justices, said the Constitution vests executive power in the President, allowing removal of executive officers without cause, with narrow exceptions. Justice Kagan dissented, arguing that existing law protects members of bodies like the NLRB and MSPB from presidential removal without good cause. Kagan also criticized the majority's exemption for the Federal Reserve, noting its independence rests on similar foundations as other agencies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while ensuring the continuation of a strategically important U.S. military base. The deal allows the U.K. to lease Diego Garcia, the largest island, for at least 99 years, maintaining the military facility. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the base's importance for British defense and security, citing its role in combating terrorism. Some Chagossians criticized the deal for not guaranteeing their right to return, while some opposition politicians voiced concerns about Mauritius's ties with China.</p>
