        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the nuances between credit card debt forgiveness and debt settlement, explaining that they are often used interchangeably by servicers. Credit card debt forgiveness typically occurs through a negotiated debt settlement, bankruptcy, or a debt management program, all requiring a debt settlement agreement. To qualify, borrowers generally need a minimum debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. The article advises borrowers to research various debt relief companies to find the most suitable option for their circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of 'Succession,' is directing his first feature-length film, 'Mountainhead,' a satire about tech billionaires facing social unrest. Armstrong explained that his interest lies in exploring power dynamics rather than just wealth, similar to his approach in 'Succession.' The film, starring Steve Carrell and Ramy Youssef, was produced rapidly to capture the anxieties surrounding technology, particularly AI. Armstrong aimed to mirror the fast-paced nature of technological developments and societal fears in the film's creation.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff has voiced her support for women's matches being featured in the night sessions at the French Open, echoing similar sentiments from fellow WTA star Ons Jabeur. Gauff argues that women's matches deserve the prime-time TV slot at Roland Garros, which has exclusively showcased men's matches thus far. She emphasized the high-quality tennis and star power on the women's side, drawing from her experience at the US Open where fans were equally excited to see her play as they were to see Novak Djokovic. Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo is expected to address the scheduling issue at a press conference.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline despite the company surpassing Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, driven by artificial intelligence. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33 and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attribute the stock's movement to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss. The results follow Salesforce's announcement of its intent to acquire Informatica for $8 billion.</p>

          <p>Germany's largest opposition party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has been designated as "extremist" by the country's domestic intelligence agency, allowing the government to monitor party members. This measure, criticized by some U.S. officials, is permitted by the German constitution, which was shaped by the United States. The article explores the historical context and rationale behind this constitutional provision, which aims to safeguard democracy from internal threats. The designation allows for tactics such as tapping phones and hiring informants to ensure the party doesn't pose a threat to democracy.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have declined again, with average rates dropping to 8.14%, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money currently.

Homeowners can refinance a HELOC into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate if they become concerned about fluctuating rates.
