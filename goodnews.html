        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The research, involving over one million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in vaccinated individuals. The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, those under 60, and individuals with unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers believe that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage and inflammation that can lead to heart issues.</p>

Despite the grim realities, the film also offers hope, showcasing the ocean's remarkable capacity to recover quickly if given the chance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's e-commerce giants like Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan are engaged in a new battleground called "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. Consumers in major cities can order a wide range of products, from iced tea to fast fashion, and have them delivered within an hour, often subsidized to be very cheap. Despite China's advanced transport and warehousing infrastructure, this intensified competition is causing investor concern, as it suggests limited room for further growth and forces platforms into a zero-sum game. The article also touches on the working conditions of delivery couriers, highlighting concerns about social security and long hours.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Urges Dismissal of States' Lawsuit on Abortion Pill Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is urging a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, challenging the FDA's expanded access to mifepristone. Justice Department lawyers argue that the states lack legal standing and that the case was filed in an improper venue. This stance aligns with an earlier request from the Biden administration to dismiss the challenge, which seeks to roll back changes allowing mifepristone to be taken later in pregnancy and dispensed through the mail. The administration asserts that the states waited too long to challenge the FDA's actions, which began in 2016.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, pushing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, U.S. drivers are paying $3.165 per gallon on average. Trump was likely referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what drivers are currently paying at the pump, as it tracks wholesale, unfinished gasoline before other costs are included. Analysts say the RBOB price is irrelevant to consumers because they are not paying the wholesale price.</p>
