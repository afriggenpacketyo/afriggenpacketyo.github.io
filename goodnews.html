          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the distribution of bonuses from the Club World Cup by wearing shirts reading ‚ÄúClub World Ca$h Grab‚Äù during warm-ups. The MLS Players Association supports the protest, arguing that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without adequate compensation. Despite MLS teams receiving significant payments for participation, the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of these funds to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement caps player earnings at 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, leading to a 90/10 split of prize money in favor of the league.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol Insurrection, is refusing the clemency offered by President Trump. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine Americans' views of the federal government. She has sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, contrasting with other Jan. 6 defendants who embraced their pardons. Hemphill's protest highlights divisions among those involved in the Capitol riot and challenges the narrative surrounding the events of that day.</p>
