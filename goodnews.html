          <p>The Japanese government will release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat rising prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold directly to retailers at a reduced price. This move aims to alleviate shortages in stores and address public frustration over elevated rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The ministry suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price increases. The government hopes that releasing the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit is in response to a biotechnology company seeking court approval to purchase the struggling firm. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without informed consent. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has expressed interest in buying the company for $256 million and stated that it would comply with 23andMe's privacy policies.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments, with most papers critical of her initial decision to cut the payment. The newspapers also highlight Labour's pledge to spend ¬£14bn on the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which the government hopes will overshadow the negative attention from the winter fuel payment U-turn. Additionally, the papers cover Greta Thunberg's detention by Israeli authorities and a new NHS treatment using sound waves to zap hard-to-reach cancers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates. The report indicates that hundreds of millions of people are unable to have the number of children they desire, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of suitable partners as primary reasons. UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people in 14 countries, with one in five respondents saying they have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The findings reveal that financial limitations are a significant factor, with 39% of people citing this as a barrier to having children.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline. The Treasury says that the project will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" that would "kickstart" economic growth. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy".

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly due to a reduction in fatalities caused by fentanyl. Data from the CDC indicates that fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens. However, challenges remain for individuals with severe addiction, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services could jeopardize this progress.</p>
