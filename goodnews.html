          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman is cautioning that America is failing its youngest investors due to inadequate financial literacy education. He argues that the current generation is susceptible to get-rich-quick schemes promoted by risky online platforms, which encourage financial gambling over sound investing. Edelman stresses the importance of obtaining financial advice from credible sources, as many young people rely on platforms like TikTok for financial education. He advocates for mandatory personal finance courses in high schools to equip young adults with the necessary skills for managing their finances, including buying a car, getting a mortgage, and saving for college.</p>

Companies repeatedly failing to recruit UK-based staff may lose the right to sponsor foreign workers.

          <p>A recent analysis reveals the amount of money retirees need to supplement their Social Security income varies significantly by state due to differences in the cost of living. The study calculated the average monthly cost of living for retirees in each state, including rent and other expenditures, and then subtracted the average Social Security benefit to determine the necessary supplemental income. The findings highlight the importance of early retirement savings to cover monthly expenses, as the average Social Security benefit alone is insufficient in most states.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India and Pakistan engaged in a sudden escalation of conflict, leading to concerns from leaders worldwide. The two countries have agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks. The rivalry between the two nations goes back decades, with the stunning mountainous region of Kashmir at the heart of the dispute. Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, holding over 12.5% ownership in Charles River Laboratories, has reached a cooperation agreement to appoint four new directors and conduct a strategic review. The agreement aims to unlock shareholder value by evaluating the company's Manufacturing Solutions business, exploring strategic acquisitions, and potentially considering a sale of the entire company. The strategic review is likely a focus for Elliott, given the terms of the settlement, and Elliott's team will evaluate potential acquisitions with an eye toward shareholder value. The article suggests the business is exceptionally high-quality and, as a result, there are numerous paths to shareholder value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid the "Too Late" label, despite potentially making the right decisions, as the Fed navigates a complex economic landscape. President Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting rates, while the Fed remains cautious due to conflicting signals from economic data and the potential impact of tariffs. The Fed's reluctance to act preemptively, combined with historical patterns of central banks being slow to respond, increases the risk of the economy entering a recession before the Fed takes action.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are advocating for a "full, unconditional ceasefire" with Russia for at least 30 days starting on Monday. This initiative follows a visit from leaders of major European countries to Kyiv and a call with President Trump, aiming to encourage Moscow to agree to a truce and begin peace talks. Despite a unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia, Ukraine claims the Kremlin's forces have repeatedly violated it. The leaders call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about the rapidly declining rates of family formation in the US and across the world. The economics of population do not work in such a way that fewer people means fewer demands on resources, as an aging and shrinking population would mean a massive decrease in expected quality of life in the future. Richer societies are better positioned to combat climate change, and while we have been headed in the right direction, that progress would be likely to reverse in a fiscally overburdened, rapidly shrinking society. The author contends that taking family formation seriously doesn‚Äôt make you a eugenicist.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, described the experience of being sealed off from the world during the conclave to elect Pope Leo XIV as "immensely peaceful." As one of 133 cardinals participating in the secretive meeting, he noted the absence of rancor or politicking among the cardinals. He found the experience to be calming, allowing him more time for prayer and reflection without the distractions of the outside world, and said that the experience was "peaceful and just wanting to do this well".</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered an 80,000-year-old spear tip carved from bone, found in Russia, which predates the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe, suggesting it was crafted by Neanderthals. This discovery indicates that Neanderthals had advanced bone-working techniques beyond simple stone tools. The level of craftsmanship of these really early bone tools is not as advanced as those found in Europe after modern humans arrived. The find contributes to growing evidence that Neanderthals independently developed sophisticated technologies.</p>

          <p>A family's struggle with their three children's diagnoses of LAD-1, a rare immune disorder, led them to participate in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy. The therapy, which essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor, has proven successful in enabling the children to produce healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. Five years after participating in the study, the children are thriving, with the therapy now under review by the FDA for potential approval as a licensed treatment.</p>
