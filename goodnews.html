          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% year-over-year increase that surpassed market expectations. This surge is primarily attributed to the high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips, which are produced for major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division constituted 57% of its revenue, with advanced chips of 7-nanometer or smaller sizes accounting for 74% of total wafer sales. This financial success highlights the ongoing boom in the AI sector and TSMC's critical role within the global technology supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.1% contraction in the previous month. This marginal expansion comes as the government faces increasing pressure to stimulate economic growth ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists and institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies have warned that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary to meet borrowing rules. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has acknowledged that she is considering further fiscal measures to ensure the stability of public finances.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, despite the team's 121-94 loss. Vincent scored 22 points, including making six of his eleven three-point attempts, with a particularly dominant first quarter where he scored 18 points. The game also saw an injury to teammate Jarred Vanderbilt, who left with a left quad contusion. The Lakers rested their usual starters for this game, providing an opportunity for other players like Vincent to showcase their skills ahead of the regular season opener against the Golden State Warriors.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the U.S. dollar to its strongest level in a year. This move comes amid growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts this year to address economic risks from U.S.-China trade tensions. A Federal Reserve governor recently suggested that the case for rate cuts has become more urgent due to these trade-related uncertainties. The strengthening of the yuan's fixing rate reflects the dynamic interplay between the monetary policies of the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the 2015 Paris Agreement has successfully steered the world away from the most catastrophic climate scenarios, potentially preventing an additional 57 deadly hot days per year compared to a future without the accord. However, the analysis by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central warns that current pledges still put the world on track for at least 2.6°C of warming, which would still cause significant harm. The report emphasizes that every fraction of a degree of warming has life-or-death consequences, particularly for vulnerable populations, and calls for more ambitious emissions cuts and adaptation measures to combat the increasing frequency of extreme heatwaves.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is actively working to break out of a significant postseason slump, taking the rare step of participating in on-field batting practice ahead of the next NLCS game. Ohtani has struggled at the plate, going just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the playoffs. Manager Dave Roberts has emphasized the team's need for Ohtani's bat to succeed, while Ohtani himself has downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting. His visible efforts to recalibrate his swing signal an urgency to return to form for the crucial upcoming games against the Brewers.</p>

          <p>Irish singer CMAT and veteran band Pulp are the leading contenders to win this year's Mercury Prize for album of the year, according to bookmakers. The award ceremony, which is being held in Newcastle for the first time, recognizes the best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland. CMAT is favored for her album "Euro-Country," while Pulp is nominated for their comeback record "More." Other notable nominees include Fontaines DC, PinkPantheress, and 84-year-old folk legend Martin Carthy, the oldest nominee in the prize's history. The event's move from London is part of a broader industry effort to decentralize and recognize talent across the entire country.</p>

          <p>A long-lost diary written by Chinese naval officer Lam Ping-yu has shed new light on the role of Chinese forces in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. The diary, rescued from a Hong Kong building slated for demolition, provides a detailed firsthand account of the landings from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies. Lam was one of over two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe. Historical researchers have since confirmed that at least 14 Chinese officers participated in the naval component of the invasion, adding a previously little-known international dimension to the historic operation.</p>
