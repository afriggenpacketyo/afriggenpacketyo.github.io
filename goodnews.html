        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Pediatrics indicates that landmark 2015 medical advice to introduce peanut products to infants as early as four months has successfully prevented peanut allergies in approximately 60,000 children. This guidance, which dramatically reversed decades of previous recommendations, led to a significant decline of over 40% in peanut allergy diagnoses in young children after its expansion in 2017. While implementation of the new guidelines has been slow due to initial confusion, the research offers promising evidence that early allergen introduction is making a measurable impact on public health. Experts now recommend introducing major food allergens between four and six months, advising parents to consult pediatricians for personalized guidance.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new V-level vocational courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications and boost technical training. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with a consultation launched on the proposals, though the specific subjects and rollout timeline are yet unclear. Additionally, a new "stepping stone" qualification will be introduced to help students who struggle with GCSE resits in maths and English. While some, like the Sixth Form Colleges Association, warn V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to offer clearer, employment-focused pathways for young people.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is in advanced discussions to appoint Sean Dyche as their new manager, following the swift sacking of Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. Dyche, a former Everton and Burnley boss, is the leading candidate after positive talks, and a deal is hoped to be concluded on Monday. Forest, currently 18th in the table after only one win in eight league games, seeks to stabilize its performance. Dyche, who was a youth player at Forest, brings a wealth of Premier League experience, having twice led Burnley to promotion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay demonstrated remarkable adaptability, leading his team to a dominant 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars despite star receiver Puka Nacua's absence due to injury. McVay drastically shifted his offensive strategy, heavily utilizing 13 personnel packages (one running back, three tight ends, one receiver), a significant departure from his usual tendencies. Quarterback Matthew Stafford excelled, throwing five touchdowns with under 200 yards, a rare feat that highlights the team's offensive prowess. This article celebrates McVay's strategic brilliance and the Rams' strong performance, also mentioning other notable NFL game results from around the league.</p>

          <p>China's biotech firm Akeso saw its Hong Kong-listed shares rise after presenting strong trial data for its innovative cancer drug, ivonescimab, at the European Society For Medical Oncology presidential symposium in Berlin. The article notes that the data, also published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet, highlights the drug's "clear edge" with lower toxicity and zero discontinuation rates, positioning it ahead of competitors in the PD-1/VEGF combination therapy space. This novel approach aims to enhance immune cells’ ability to recognize and attack cancer cells while also blocking the formation of new blood vessels in tumors, offering significant promise for cancer treatment.

          <p>Poland is highlighted as an economic success story within the EU, consistently posting strong GDP growth rates, significantly outperforming the overall EU average, France, and Germany. Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland has seen an average annual growth of almost 4%, driven primarily by strong private consumption and a relatively closed economy that shelters it from external shocks. The article attributes this success to its effective integration into EU and NATO structures, extensive EU funding, strategic geopolitical importance, and a well-educated workforce. While potential headwinds include political divisions and the need for fiscal consolidation, experts remain optimistic about Poland's long-term economic dynamism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Pembrokeshire couple, Abigail and Marcus Beck, built their £150,000 eco-home under Wales' unique One Planet Development (OPD) policy, which mandates a stringent green lifestyle and continuous monitoring. The policy requires residents to demonstrate a basic income from the land, provide all their own energy and water, and minimize their carbon footprint, with annual reports and financial accounts. The couple utilized trees from their forest and recycled materials for construction, facing setbacks like rainwater damage and budget overruns, ultimately spending £150,000. They express determination to challenge perceptions and prove the viability and pride of this sustainable living model, showcasing Welsh creativity in a sustainable way.</p>
