          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, denies that the party is in chaos after chairman Zia Yusuf resigned and then returned to a different role within 48 hours. Yusuf initially resigned, shortly after criticizing the party's newest MP, Sarah Pochin, for questioning the government about banning the burka. Tice stated that Yusuf was "exhausted" from working 24/7 and that the party is reorganizing to better manage its growth, with Yusuf now focusing on identifying spending cuts at councils. A new chairman and deputy chairman are expected to be appointed next week.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the coast of Southwestern Mexico, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting it to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to portions of Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate sea swells with life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast. NOAA officials have predicted a 60% chance of an "above-normal" hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist explains that a sour tone often signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, and that arguments about family often reflect misalignments and unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute to relationship problems. The article offers strategies for couples to navigate these conflicts, such as naming the effect of a condescending tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, and redistributing household tasks equitably.</p>

          <p>Arthur Sze's poem, "Under a Supermoon," reflects on the beauty of the present moment and the interconnectedness of life. The poem contrasts grand aspirations with the appreciation of simple details, such as gold flares in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split pi√±on and juniper. Sze recalls Blake‚Äôs wisdom that the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise and contemplates the exploding and birthing stars within life itself. The piece celebrates the richness and complexity of existence.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about ethical non-monogamy in her marriage, where her husband is interested in pursuing a relationship with a colleague, but she is not. The columnist draws on the philosophy of Erich Fromm, emphasizing the importance of openness, freedom, and a strong sense of self in love. The article suggests that the reader clearly communicate her needs and boundaries while also exploring the possibility of becoming more receptive to non-monogamy through self-reflection and improved communication within the marriage. The article suggests focusing on strengthening the current relationship before considering opening it up.</p>

          <p>American Airlines passengers on a flight from Philadelphia to Naples were forced to take a bus to their final destination after the aircraft was diverted to Rome due to its size. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was deemed too large to land at Naples Airport, leading to the diversion and a roughly 3-hour bus journey for passengers. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, citing "operational limitations." Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically flies a smaller Boeing 787-8 to Naples.</p>
