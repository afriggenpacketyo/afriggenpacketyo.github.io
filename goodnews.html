          <p>Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq surged to record highs, fueled by growing optimism surrounding U.S. trade negotiations with key international partners. Market sentiment was significantly boosted by Canada's decision to cancel its planned digital services tax on American technology firms, which prompted premarket gains for major tech stocks. Investor focus is now turning to upcoming economic data and developments on a major domestic spending bill to gauge if the upward market momentum can be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a specific protein. The research, published in the journal Nature Aging, provides a detailed single-cell analysis of the aging process within the primate cochlea. Furthermore, the study found that the common diabetes medication metformin was able to slow the progression of hearing loss in monkeys, suggesting a potential future pathway for developing personalized clinical treatments for the condition in humans.</p>

          <p>France has implemented a new, restrictive outdoor smoking ban that prohibits lighting up in public spaces such as parks, beaches, swimming pools, and near schools. The measure is a key part of the government's long-term strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 by reducing children's exposure to smoking. While public polling indicates broad support for the new law, some critics point out that it does not currently include e-cigarettes, and some smokers feel the restrictions are excessive for outdoor areas.</p>

The company is actively defending its vast repository of user-generated conversations by suing AI firms like Anthropic for alleged unlawful data scraping to train their models. At the same time, Reddit is competing by launching its own AI-powered features, like a chatbot that provides answers sourced directly from its community discussions, in an effort to preserve its unique value.</p>

In exchange for the tariff relief, the UK has agreed to scrap duties on US beef and ethanol imports. (not investment advice)</p>
