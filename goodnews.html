          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reveals that more American adults with mental health needs are engaging in talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications alone has declined. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving only medication decreased, while the percentage receiving only talk therapy increased, particularly among those with depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. The expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers as providers have contributed to increased access to therapy, although affluent individuals have benefited the most.

          <p>Trump's tariffs are not solely based on economic theory but also on the idea of "protectionism" and protecting a way of life. The tariffs aim to create good-paying factory jobs and sustain local communities.
