          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that public schools must provide accommodations for families' religious beliefs, particularly concerning instruction on moral topics for young children. The ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor stemmed from a Maryland case where a school district ended an opt-out policy for reading materials on sexuality and gender identity. The Court determined that schools cannot force children into instruction that contradicts their parents' religious views without a compelling reason. This decision sets a significant precedent for religious freedom and parent-school collaboration.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese Middle East expert, Beijing will likely remain cautious and avoid providing direct military support to Iran despite escalating tensions with the U.S. and Israel. While Iran may seek Chinese weapons, China is focused on balancing its relationships with all regional powers, including Israel and other Western-aligned states. The analysis suggests that while the direct conflict may not broaden, tit-for-tat attacks could continue as Iran advances its nuclear program. This reflects China's strategic interest in regional stability over taking sides in the conflict.</p>

The rule serves as a practical framework to manage expectations, as no house is perfect.

          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting a significant drop in U.S. gas prices, suggesting this summer could be the cheapest for fuel since 2021. Experts predict the national average could fall below $3 per gallon by September, following a brief spike due to the recent Israel-Iran conflict. The expected decline is attributed to the de-escalation in the Middle East, increased refinery production, and a typical softening of consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
