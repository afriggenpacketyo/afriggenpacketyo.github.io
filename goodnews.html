          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng is planning an international launch for its mass-market Mona series in 2026, starting with Europe next year. CEO He Xiaopeng stated that the company's global expansion is proceeding faster than anticipated, having already established a presence in 60 countries. The move is expected to intensify competition in the European EV market, challenging established automakers like Volkswagen and BMW as well as Chinese rivals such as BYD. Amid a fierce price war in its domestic market, Xpeng's leadership also indicated an openness to acquiring other companies, including fellow EV manufacturers, to navigate the competitive landscape.</p>

The upgraded agreement, which concluded negotiations in May, will provide broader market access in key sectors like agriculture, digital trade, and pharmaceuticals. This initiative seeks to deepen cooperation in areas such as the green and digital economies, including expanding digital infrastructure and promoting AI technologies. The move is viewed as an effort to bolster Asia's trade networks amid rising global protectionism and economic competition.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's Education Secretary, has announced her candidacy for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, becoming the most senior figure to enter the race to succeed Angela Rayner. She joins backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy as a declared candidate, with others like Emily Thornberry considering a run. Candidates face a tight deadline, needing nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs by Thursday evening. The compressed timeline has drawn criticism from some within the party, who argue it unfairly limits the scope for a broader discussion on the party's future direction.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated in public league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts across seven areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to increase public transparency and accountability, allowing patients to make more informed choices. However, organizations like NHS Providers have raised concerns about whether the chosen metrics accurately reflect performance and could lead to unintended consequences for patient confidence.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu is set to issue a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure financing for its artificial intelligence initiatives. This move comes as the company seeks lower financing costs and greater operational flexibility following a recent report of weak second-quarter earnings. The bond, which matures in 2029 with a 1.9% coupon, is Baidu's second such issuance this year, reflecting a broader trend of companies utilizing China's relatively low interest rates. This strategy aims to bolster Baidu's competitive position in the rapidly expanding AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-running succession battle within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended, with a deal ensuring his son Lachlan will control the trust containing shares in Fox Corp and News Corp.

Under the new arrangement, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will cease to be beneficiaries of the trust with voting shares, instead receiving cash from the sale of their holdings.

The new models will be the first released since President Trump's return to office and his administration's push for domestic manufacturing. Despite this pressure, the devices are still expected to be produced in China and India, facing tariffs of around 25%. This has led to speculation that Apple may implement its first significant price increase in five years to protect its profit margins, a move that would come as competitors like Google have held their prices steady.</p>
