        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from the previous month and the lowest rate since March. This moderation is partly attributed to the easing of rice prices, which had previously surged dramatically. Despite the slowdown, the inflation figure was slightly higher than economists' expectations, and the "core-core" rate, which also excludes energy, remained steady. The Bank of Japan continues to closely monitor these figures as it navigates its economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without sufficient scientific backing, following investigations that found some products were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with these voluntary measures, with the government suggesting further action could be taken if they fail to do so.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact for Aberdeen, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead a comeback from 2-0 down to secure a 2-2 draw against FCSB. The performance in the Europa League play-off has intensified calls from fans for Polvara, who has been used sparingly this season, to be given a starting role. His dynamic cameo, which included a high-quality goal and creating several chances, has presented manager Jimmy Thelin with a strong case for his inclusion in future matches.</p>

          <p>Roborock, a leading Chinese smart vacuum company, plans to significantly reduce the price of its high-end household cleaning robots, which feature AI-powered robotic arms. Company president Quan Gang predicts that advances in AI will allow such technology to become a mass-market reality by 2030, with prices falling to a few hundred dollars. Despite current high costs and tariffs, the company is investing heavily in AI research and expanding its supply chain to achieve its goal of increasing the low household penetration rate of robotic cleaners globally.</p>

          <p>Donald McPherson, a World War II Navy fighter pilot from Nebraska recognized as America's last living "ace," has passed away at the age of 103.

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to combat "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making price wars that have plagued industries like the solar panel sector. The draft revision, open for public feedback, aims to prevent companies from selling products below cost to eliminate competitors and establish a more sustainable market equilibrium. This move follows calls from authorities to address the severe oversupply and cutthroat competition that have led to substantial financial losses for many Chinese businesses.
