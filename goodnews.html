          <p>President Trump has granted a further 90-day extension for TikTok's sale in the US, following a law passed last year requiring the app to be banned unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. Trump, who had vowed to save TikTok during his presidential campaign, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement date for the third time, with the new deadline set for September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's leadership and support in keeping the app online for its 170 million US users, indicating ongoing collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office to finalize the sale agreement, which is expected to require approval from Beijing authorities. The White House emphasized that the extension would ensure the continued use of TikTok by Americans while safeguarding their data.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a high-profile Massachusetts retrial; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The jury reached this verdict on their fourth day of deliberations, following a first trial that ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and leaving him to die, but her defense argued that she was framed by a group of people, including law enforcement. The timeline of events included a night of drinking, a strained relationship between Read and O'Keefe, and conflicting evidence regarding a Google search about how long it takes to die in the cold.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" offers a unique take on the war film genre, focusing on the existential uncertainties and dazed souls amidst the American Civil War. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army during the winter of 1862, emphasizing the minutiae of their daily lives rather than intense combat. Minervini's naturalistic style and close collaboration with the cast create a sense of place and time, highlighting the characters' inner thoughts and rudimentary musings about God, war, and manhood. By avoiding typical anti-war tropes, the film subtly explores the economic inequalities, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague the nation.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University in Virginia have unearthed a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. The cellar contained artifacts like slate pencil fragments and jewelry, offering new insights into the lives of enslaved students who were taught at the school in the 1760s. The school, which used a religious framework to justify slavery, was later transformed into a dormitory for some of the first women to attend college. Other finds included handmade ceramics associated with sites of enslavement and a shard of glass depicting Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are increasing the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers of lumber, steel, and aluminum have already raised prices for builders, with the National Association of Home Builders estimating a typical price increase of around $10,000 per project. Strategies to save money include pre-ordering materials before prices rise, focusing on paint jobs instead of new appliances, and budgeting an additional 30% for tariff-related costs. Builders also advise homeowners to prioritize fixing exterior damage and working with suppliers to lock in prices when possible. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, set to be signed in Washington, aims to end fighting and bring American investment into the region, which is rich in minerals like coltan, cobalt, and gold. The agreement includes provisions on territorial integrity, disarmament, and economic integration, but faces skepticism due to the exclusion of the M23 militia from negotiations.

          <p>Public pools are essential for mental, physical, and social health, providing a space for exercise, relaxation, and community engagement. Swimming has been shown to boost moods and offer a unique sense of buoyancy and embrace, but many public pools have become neglected and underfunded due to racial tensions and the rise of private pools. Historical perspectives highlight the role of pools as recreational hot spots and social hubs, but desegregation led to the decline of public pools as some retreated to private clubs. Revitalizing public pools could address health disparities, promote community unity, and offer a vital resource for all, especially during hot summers.</p>

The motion, passed in the Senedd, makes it an offense to supply wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business transactions. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies stated the ban aims to reduce plastic and microplastic pollution, encouraging the shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. Research from Cardiff University found that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and river pollution.</p>
