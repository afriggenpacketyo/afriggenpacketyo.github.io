          <p>China is intensifying enforcement of export controls on critical minerals, inspecting exporters and cracking down on illegal mining in regions like Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan. This move aims to tighten Beijing's grip on global critical mineral supplies amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. Hunan is mapping out its strategic mineral exporters to strengthen compliance, while Guangxi is increasing supervision on mining activities. These actions reflect China's strategy to maintain its dominance in the production and supply of essential elements for various industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to unveil a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across England, focusing on mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, including extensions to tram networks in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. This investment marks a shift from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the announcement as a watershed moment for improving transport in the North and Midlands, while Liberal Democrats urged the Chancellor to deliver on these promises and cut fares.

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, falling short of expectations due to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to extreme weather events affecting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to a two-year low in May, anticipating a gradual pick-up in GDP growth driven by consumption recovery and public demand.

The article draws parallels with other historical instances of controversial innovations, such as the use of oxygen during the first Everest summit and the introduction of carbon-plated running shoes. The piece explores the psychological aspects of competition and the potential for innovation to create both winners and losers. It questions whether recreational mountaineering should be subject to the same competitive ethos as professional sports.</p>
