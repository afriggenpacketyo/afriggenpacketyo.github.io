          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek re-election to the U.S. House rather than run for governor of New York in 2026. Lawler, who represents a competitive Hudson Valley district, stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining the Republican House majority. The announcement shifts the landscape for the GOP gubernatorial primary, potentially clearing a path for Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been encouraged by former President Trump to consider a run against incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul.</p>

          <p>At 95, actor and director Clint Eastwood maintains his vitality through a disciplined health regimen he has followed for decades, according to biographer Shawn Levy. His routine includes consistent gym workouts, a low-fat organic diet, and the daily practice of Transcendental Meditation, which he reportedly began in the 1970s. This form of meditation is known for promoting deep rest and reducing stress, which can lead to benefits like lower blood pressure and improved mental clarity, contributing to his overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a wet and chaotic sprint finish on stage 17. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that took several of Milan's key rivals out of contention. The win allowed the Lidl-Trek rider to significantly extend his lead in the points classification for the green jersey. Overall race leader Tadej Pogačar finished safely within the peloton, maintaining his substantial lead in the general classification.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the UN's International Court of Justice has ruled that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including those from historical emissions. The decision is a victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying island states that initiated the case, as it opens a potential legal pathway for them to seek compensation for climate-related damages. While non-binding, the ruling establishes that international law requires countries to protect the environment and could influence future climate litigation globally.</p>

          <p>Real estate experts are debating whether eliminating or increasing the exemption for capital gains tax on home sales, a move floated by President Trump, would significantly impact the housing market. The National Association of Realtors argues that the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing, thereby limiting inventory. However, some analysts contend that while it might help high-end homeowners, the real key to unlocking the market is restoring broader economic confidence and stability, not a targeted tax cut.

          <p>Researchers have successfully used CRISPR gene-editing technology to alter a single amino acid in mosquitoes, making them largely incapable of transmitting the malaria parasite. The genetic tweak disrupts the parasite's journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, effectively blocking its path to a new host. Scientists hope this modification can be spread through wild mosquito populations using a gene drive, offering a promising new tool to combat a disease that infects over 260 million people annually, though the technology remains controversial.</p>
