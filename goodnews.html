          <p>The upcoming week is poised to be critical for the stock market, with several major events on the horizon for investors to monitor closely. Key developments include a Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, the release of the latest inflation and jobs data, and earnings reports from influential companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Additionally, the market will be reacting to a new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union. These factors combined will provide significant insight into the health of the economy and corporate performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than previously threatened but higher than the EU had hoped for. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments. While some products like pharmaceuticals are exempt, the deal aims to rebalance the trade relationship and bring stability.</p>

          <p>UBTech has unveiled a new humanoid robot, the Walker S2, with the ability to autonomously swap its own battery, enabling it to work nearly 24/7 without human intervention. When its power is low, the robot proceeds to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fresh one in a process that takes about three minutes. Designed for factory automation, the 5-foot-3-inch robot has been tested in Chinese car factories. This development represents a significant step forward in robotics, aiming to enhance productivity by allowing machines to operate continuously.</p>
