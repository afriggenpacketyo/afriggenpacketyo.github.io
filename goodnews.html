          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the U.S. government from deporting 10 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The order, which lasts for 14 days, responds to a legal challenge from immigration advocacy groups who argue the removals would violate U.S. laws protecting vulnerable minors. The lawsuit contends that the children, aged 10 to 17, could face abuse, persecution, or torture if returned to Guatemala. The planned deportations are part of a broader immigration crackdown initiated after Donald Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers convened for informal talks to brainstorm new avenues of support for Ukraine amidst the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the potential implementation of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and a plan to establish Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil as a "safe haven." Ministers also revisited the contentious topic of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction efforts. Another proposal involves shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian soil following a potential ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement by value, a £10 billion deal to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move the UK government says will support approximately 4,000 jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates. The deal represents a significant victory for the British defense industry, which was chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>A massive kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. Over the past 13 years, divers led by The Bay Foundation have cleared over 80 acres, allowing the once-decimated "sequoias of the sea" to thrive again. The kelp forests, vital for storing carbon and providing habitat for hundreds of marine species, had declined by 80% due to an explosion in the urchin population. The effort is now being viewed as a potential model for restoring underwater ecosystems in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Forty years after his historic discovery of the RMS Titanic, ocean explorer Bob Ballard reflects on the mission and his ongoing career in deep-sea exploration. The 1985 expedition was famously a cover for a top-secret U.S. Navy mission to survey sunken nuclear submarines, a context that shaped his search strategy. Ballard realized he should look for the ship's debris field, a much larger target, which led to the breakthrough. The technology developed for that search has since revolutionized ocean science, and at 83, Ballard is still actively exploring, recently mapping WWII wrecks in the Pacific.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion, the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While nine tickets nationwide matched the five white balls to win $1 million each, the grand prize has continued to roll over since the last winner on May 31. The next drawing will take place on Monday night, with a potential winner choosing between the full annuity paid over 29 years or a lump sum cash option of $498.4 million before taxes. This marks the sixth time the game's jackpot has surpassed the billion-dollar threshold.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, extending his lead in the championship standings. His teammate, Lando Norris, was on track for a comfortable second-place finish when an oil leak forced him to retire from the race with just seven laps remaining. The dramatic turn of events proved decisive in the title fight between the two McLaren drivers. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed his first-ever podium finish for Racing Bulls, capping off a chaotic race that featured three safety cars and multiple crashes.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after a long and painful legal battle to regain control of his own songs. For decades, Fogerty felt he had lost his musical legacy, even stopping performing his classic songs like "Proud Mary" and "Fortunate Son" for a period. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he not only bought back the rights to his catalog but also recorded the new versions with his sons, Shane and Tyler, who are part of his touring band. He describes the process as revisiting the feelings he had when he first wrote the iconic tracks.</p>

          <p>A new report from FlexJobs has identified the leading job sectors offering remote, part-time work, with education, healthcare, and project management topping the list. The analysis of over 60,000 companies found that roles such as licensed therapist, career consultant, and nurse practitioner are among the most common opportunities. Career experts note that such positions are in high demand as they allow workers to supplement their income, upskill, or explore new career paths without committing to a full-time role. The number of remote, part-time jobs in mental health, project management, and administrative fields saw a 27% increase over the past year.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the ten-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy, prompted by wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, has had a profound and lasting impact on German society and politics. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of both the successes and challenges of integration. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, debates over immigration, social cohesion, and resource allocation continue to dominate the national conversation.</p>

          <p>The Premier League transfer window is heading into its final, hectic phase, with several high-profile moves still in play before Monday's deadline. The biggest ongoing saga involves Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, who is attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a deal that could be unlocked by Newcastle's own pursuit of new forwards. Meanwhile, Arsenal completed a last-minute hijacking of Eberechi Eze's expected move to Tottenham. Other potential deals to watch include the future of PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi's anticipated transfer to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A woman in Llanharan, Wales, had a surprising experience while pet-sitting her brother's pregnant Labrador, Tilly, who went into labor a week earlier than expected. The dog, initially thought to be carrying about six puppies, gave birth to a massive litter of 14 over a 15-hour period while her owner was on holiday abroad. The pet sitter, Rhian Boxall, described the event as a "rollercoaster of emotions," successfully saving one pup born outside in the garden with advice from an emergency vet. Twelve of the fourteen puppies survived, and the owner returned from his trip to a much larger canine family than he had anticipated.</p>
