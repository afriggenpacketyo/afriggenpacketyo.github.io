        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is considering measures to lower electricity prices for industrial companies to prevent business closures and relocation abroad. The coalition government plans to reduce electricity prices by lowering the electricity tax and cutting surcharges and grid fees. Critics warn that this broad-based relief could contradict renewable energy goals and reduce incentives for energy efficiency. Experts suggest that tailored measures and a faster rollout of renewable energy would be more effective in the long term, while also raising concerns about EU state aid rules.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not intend to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, partnerships with suppliers, and productivity improvements. He noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. This pricing strategy contrasts with Walmart, which has indicated it will need to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported disappointing first-quarter earnings but beat sales estimates, maintaining its full-year sales forecast.</p>

Despite signing a lucrative contract, Soto's performance has been mixed, and Mendoza wants to ensure he consistently runs hard. Soto has denied the lollygagging, claiming he has been hustling.</p>
