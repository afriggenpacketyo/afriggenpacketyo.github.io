          <p>Joseph Torigian's book, *The Party's Interests Come First*, examines Xi Jinping's political convictions through the life of his father, Xi Zhongxun, a prominent Chinese politician. The book emphasizes understanding the emotional life of the elder Xi and how his personal tragedies shaped his political convictions, which may have influenced his son. Xi Zhongxun's life provides insights into the evolution of the Chinese Communist Party and its approach to various issues. The book poses the question of whether a different, more consensus-oriented party was ever possible, exploring why moments of experimentation failed and why the party prioritized its interests above all else.</p>

          <p>Josh Brown, a CNBC investor, identified Snowflake Inc. as one of his favorite names in the market. Brown noted that the stock reached a peak of $400 and then steadily declined for three years, but after reaching a low last September, the shares have "been working really well." He believes that Snowflake Inc. can climb further "towards some of (its) older highs." Brown's net revenue retention rate of 124% shows that its customers are increasing the amount of money that they spend on SNOW's offerings. (not investment advice)</p>
