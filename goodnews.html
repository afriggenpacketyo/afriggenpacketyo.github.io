          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister Taku Eto after Eto made a remark about having so much gifted rice that he could sell it, which was perceived as insensitive given rising rice prices. The move comes amid already low public support for Ishiba following slush fund scandals within the ruling party. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an effort to regain public trust ahead of a looming parliamentary election. Political analysts suggest that a poor showing in the election could jeopardize Ishiba's premiership, as opposition parties are eager to capitalize on the misstep.</p>

          <p>The finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 nations convened in Canada, expressing a unified front in addressing global economic imbalances and supporting Ukraine, despite ongoing trade tensions stemming from U.S. tariffs. While avoiding direct criticism of Trump's tariff policies, the group acknowledged leveraging strong economic relationships to tackle issues like China's industrial overcapacity and nonmarket practices, such as government subsidies. The communique omitted the group's usual promotion of free trade, reflecting the Trump administration's agenda, but Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne emphasized the G7's unity in purpose and action. Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko joined the gathering, underscoring the G7's commitment to supporting Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices and reduced government utility subsidies, marking the highest level in over two years. The Bank of Japan is considering its rate hike policy while monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. Rice prices have doubled over the past year, prompting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to pledge to lower them. Core-core CPI, excluding both energy and fresh food, rose by 3.0% in April, indicating underlying price pressures in the economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives to avoid widespread city worker layoffs. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in the lowest officer count since 1995, and scales back proposed hires for the Los Angeles Fire Department. Some council members voiced concerns over these cuts, while others defended the budget's focus on avoiding layoffs and addressing homelessness. The budget also restores funding for cultural affairs, climate initiatives, and legal defense for residents facing deportation.</p>

Preliminary data suggests the NB.1.8.1 variant has a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.
