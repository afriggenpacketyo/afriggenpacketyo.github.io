          <p>The Welsh government has initiated a pilot program offering £1 single bus tickets and £3 day passes for individuals aged 16-21 across Wales, with an expansion to younger children planned for November. This scheme, supported by £15 million over two financial years, seeks to make public transport more accessible and affordable, thereby encouraging young people to utilize buses for education, training, employment, and leisure activities. Transport for Wales has already received over 10,000 applications for the mytravelpass, indicating strong interest. While the initiative aims to foster sustainable travel behaviors, an independent watchdog noted that young people's satisfaction with value for money in Wales' public transport is currently lower than in England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open broadly higher on Monday, with major indices like the UK's FTSE, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB all showing projected slight gains. This positive market sentiment is largely influenced by a recent dovish speech from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which has fueled expectations for a potential interest rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September meeting. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading as investors evaluated China's August manufacturing data, and US financial markets are observing the Labor Day public holiday. The day's data front in Europe remains relatively quiet, with Turkish growth and EU unemployment figures expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Monday as investors carefully assessed China's RatingDog manufacturing data for August, which indicated an unexpected expansion at 50.5, a rebound from the previous month's contraction. Market sentiment was also shaped by evolving India-China relations, following an agreement between leaders to function as development partners rather than rivals during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping used his opening remarks at the summit to advocate for strengthening artificial intelligence cooperation among SCO members, while explicitly rejecting a "Cold War mentality." Hong Kong's Hang Seng index notably rose, boosted by Alibaba Group's significant jump, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index saw declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the private RatingDog PMI reaching 50.5, surpassing estimates and marking the fastest expansion in five months. This improvement was partly driven by a recovery in new export orders, indicating resilience despite tariffs, though domestic demand showed less improvement. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak for the fifth consecutive month, reflecting continued caution among business owners. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand, as profit recovery remains slow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met, signaling a renewed effort to normalize relations, partly spurred by the Trump administration's 50% tariffs on Indian imports. This outreach is seen as India's "strategic autonomy" in response to US pressure, despite India-US ties being at a low. Key challenges remain, including ongoing border disputes with tens of thousands of troops deployed, and India's burgeoning trade deficit with China. The meeting resulted in agreements to resume direct flights and simplify visa processes, but future progress hinges on resolving these deeper issues and navigating India's complex multilateral engagements, including the Quad summit.</p>

          <p>The descendants of the "Flying Tigers," American volunteer pilots who aided China during World War II, are among the few US invitees to China's upcoming military parade. These mercenaries, credited with destroying hundreds of Japanese planes, are still revered in China despite current US-China tensions, symbolizing a historical bond. The article details how Claire Chennault recruited these pilots in 1941, offering high pay to defend China against Japan, and how their tactical prowess and the iconic shark-mouth planes cemented their legend. Their contribution bought vital time for the Allied war effort, and their legacy is celebrated in numerous Chinese museums.</p>

          <p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen announced that Europe is formulating "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine, intended as part of post-conflict security guarantees. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz indicated that Germany is preparing for a protracted conflict, stressing that ending the war at the expense of Ukraine's independence is unacceptable. Von der Leyen confirmed that US President Donald Trump has provided clear and repeated assurances of an American presence to support this security arrangement, which was discussed during an August meeting involving Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and senior European leaders. This strategic move aims to solidify Ukraine's future security landscape.</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government indicates that while various technologies could enforce its upcoming social media ban for under-16s, all methods carry risks and shortcomings. The ban, set for December, aims to mitigate social media's harmful effects, but concerns exist regarding data privacy and the accuracy of age verification. Methods explored include government document verification, parental approval, and facial assessment technology, with none providing a universally effective solution. The report recommends a layered approach, acknowledging that technology providers are working to counter circumvention. The government emphasizes that platforms, as wealthy AI leaders, must implement age assurance methods.</p>

This impressive win propelled the 38-year-old tennis star to achieve a historic milestone, becoming the oldest man to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season, further extending his all-time record to 64 major quarter-final appearances. Despite briefly grappling with discomfort in his neck, Djokovic maintained his composure and effectively dominated the match, breaking Struff's serve six times. He is now set to face the No. 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, the last American man remaining in the bracket, as he continues his pursuit of a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong shares experienced a significant surge of almost 19% following the announcement of a better-than-expected first-quarter net income, primarily propelled by accelerated sales growth in its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival of its core e-commerce business. Although overall revenue fell short of estimates, the company's net income remarkably increased by 78%, partly attributed to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The cloud division notably saw a 26% revenue increase, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth, firmly positioning Alibaba as a major player in the artificial intelligence sector. The company is also making substantial investments in "quick commerce" despite intense market competition, aiming for considerable future gross merchandise value. (not investment advice)</p>
