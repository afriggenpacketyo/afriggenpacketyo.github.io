          <p>A power outage struck Cannes, France, disrupting the film festival's final day. French authorities suspect sabotage, citing arson at an electrical substation and damage to a transmission tower. Approximately 160,000 homes lost power, but service was restored by the afternoon. Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to a backup power supply.

          <p>DMVs across the United States are alerting drivers to a new wave of phishing text messages designed to steal personal and financial information. These scams, known as "smishing," involve texts warning of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threatening penalties. The FBI and FTC have intervened previously due to the rise of these scams, with Americans losing over $12 billion to fraud in 2024. Experts advise registering phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry and avoiding clicking on links from unknown numbers. </p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, despite facing state censorship and imprisonment, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film "It Was Just an Accident." Panahi was banned from filmmaking and international travel in 2010 but continued to create films clandestinely. The film confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer. Panahi's win marks a significant moment for a filmmaker who has defied restrictions to continue his artistic expression.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location during construction of a new control tower. The Army stated there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic. The NTSB was not briefed on the Army's findings prior to their release to the media, causing frustration within the agency.</p>
