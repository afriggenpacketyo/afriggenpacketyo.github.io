          <p>Thousands of "No Kings Day" protests occurred across the U.S. to counter President Trump's military parade.  The protests aimed to oppose Trump's administration policies and actions, including immigration enforcement and civil rights issues.  The protests were largely peaceful, though some were cancelled due to the ongoing manhunt for the Minnesota shooter.  Trump downplayed the protests, asserting he does not feel like a king.</p>
