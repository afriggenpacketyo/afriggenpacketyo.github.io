          <p>Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon championship and sixth Grand Slam title with a stunningly dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory over Amanda Anisimova. The win was unexpected, as the 24-year-old Polish player is primarily known for her prowess on clay and hard courts. Swiatek described the victory as "surreal," noting that even she did not expect to win on grass. This achievement marks a significant return to form after a challenging year and solidifies her status as one of the top players in the world, having now won major titles on all three surfaces.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured the championship with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel. This marks the first time since 1936 that two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam title together. The victory is particularly notable as both players watched their former partners win the same title at SW19 last year, and they have now achieved their own Grand Slam success less than a year after teaming up.</p>

          <p>A historic Avro Lancaster bomber, one of only two still airworthy in the world, sent an emergency alert after experiencing an engine problem during a families day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) aircraft diagnosed unusual engine behavior and safely returned to its base at RAF Coningsby as a precaution. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines, but no crew members were injured. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the issue and its potential impact on future appearances.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to protect players from extreme heat. This decision follows concerns about player welfare raised during the recent Club World Cup in the US, where one player described the 35C conditions as "very dangerous." The tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico, has four indoor venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver. Infantino acknowledged heat is a significant issue and that utilizing these covered stadiums more frequently is a necessary measure.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent announcements of new tariffs on major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S. stock market has remained near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style and are not panicking as they did during previous trade disputes. The market's resilience is also attributed to other administration policies, such as deregulation and a hands-off approach to artificial intelligence development, which are seen as drivers of corporate earnings and economic growth, offsetting the concerns about trade friction.

          <p>The third Test between England and India at Lord's is hanging in the balance after a dramatic conclusion to the third day. England's bowlers took India's last four wickets for just 11 runs, dismissing the tourists for 387 and leveling the first-innings scores. In a tense final few minutes, England's openers navigated one over to close on 2-0, with tempers flaring between the sides over time-wasting tactics. The day was a grueling battle, highlighted by key performances from India's KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, and a crucial run-out by England captain Ben Stokes.</p>

Palermo, who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of overseeing massive cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. The 'ndrangheta is one of Italy's most influential criminal organizations, and this arrest marks a significant blow to its international drug trafficking operations, which have expanded globally in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO, Randy Sharpe, has clarified the context behind the numbers. Many of the closures were small food court kiosks located within Hy-Vee grocery stores, following the end of a franchise agreement, and were not full-service restaurants. Sharpe stated that the move is part of a strategy to focus on "quality, not quantity" and ensure all locations represent the brand's standards. The chain is also moving forward with a menu update, introducing new limited-time items to drive customer interest.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are seeking a judicial review of UK government guidance on smartphones in schools, arguing for a complete ban to protect children. They have sent a legal letter to the Education Secretary, claiming the current policy, which lets headteachers decide, is unlawful and unsafe. The campaigners cite safeguarding incidents involving cyberbullying, the sharing of indecent images, and exposure to harmful content as reasons for their legal challenge. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>
