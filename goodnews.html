          <p>Amid persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with top accounts currently yielding rates higher than inflation. The article contrasts national average CD yields with the more competitive rates offered by online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently offer higher returns than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering to maximize earnings in this environment.

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the retailer maintained its full-year sales growth forecast, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The company noted encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% increase in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. However, executives acknowledged that a "deferral mindset" among homeowners persists due to general economic uncertainty, which continues to impact larger home improvement projects more than high interest rates.

Events like "The Land Will Always Remember Us" and "Abolish ICE Mercado de Arte" have brought together dozens of artists to sell their work, raising tens of thousands of dollars for organizations such as the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and CHIRLA. These initiatives aim to create sanctuaries, foster unity, and provide direct financial aid to those affected by the raids.</p>

The letter was a gesture of gratitude for Melania Trump's efforts to raise awareness about the estimated 19,500 Ukrainian children who Ukraine says have been abducted by Russia during the war. This diplomatic exchange highlights the humanitarian crisis of forcibly displaced children, an issue that has led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants have reached a tentative agreement, ending a nearly four-day strike that caused widespread travel disruptions and stranded thousands of passengers. The airline plans to gradually restart operations, but warns it may take up to a week to return to a full schedule. The agreement, which still requires ratification by union members, was reached after resolving key deadlocks over pay and working hours, with the union stating the deal achieves "transformational change" for its workers.</p>
