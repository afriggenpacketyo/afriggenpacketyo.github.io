          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of rolling over existing debt, as reported in the article. This downgrade reflects concerns about the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The article notes that Moody's action aligns with similar downgrades by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings in previous years, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased slightly following the announcement.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States appears to be reversing the trend of rising drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures showing a significant decline of 27,000 deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, as reported in the article. This marks the steepest single-year decline in overdose deaths in 45 years, bringing the numbers back to pre-pandemic levels. The increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and tougher enforcement on fentanyl have contributed to this positive shift. The article cautions that deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are still rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution could hinder further progress.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan are skeptical that the country will meet its 2030 target of having women in 30% of top corporate positions, according to a Kyodo News survey reported in the article. The survey cites slow changes in views among male-dominated executive ranks and the need for cultural shifts as key obstacles. Respondents pointed to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues as persistent challenges. While most would encourage younger women to pursue senior roles, few believe the country's equal opportunity legislation has fully achieved its aims.</p>
