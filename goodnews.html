          <p>President Trump has selected Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and author, as his new nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, who withdrew her nomination following scrutiny of her medical credentials. Trump praised Means's "MAHA" credentials and her commitment to reversing the chronic disease epidemic, noting she will collaborate with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Means, known for her book "Good Energy" co-authored with her brother Calley Means, advocates for addressing diet and movement in healthcare and has expressed concerns about vaccines and the FDA. Her background includes attending Stanford Medical School and founding Levels, a company offering continuous glucose monitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-led bans on flying pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have creatively circumvented these restrictions by adopting official pride flags. Salt Lake City's mayor, Erin Mendenhall, introduced three new city flags featuring the city's sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag, which were unanimously approved by the city council. Similarly, Boise's mayor, Lauren McLean, issued a proclamation retroactively designating the pride flag as an official city flag. These measures are a direct response to state legislation limiting the types of flags that can be flown on government property, reflecting a broader trend of conservative legislatures targeting LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a short span, a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. In this recent incident, the Super Hornet crashed during an attempted landing on the Truman's flight deck due to an arrestment failure; both pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries. This follows an earlier incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard while being towed in the hangar bay, with initial reports suggesting evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants as a possible cause, though this was later denied. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced multiple incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including an accidental shooting down of a plane and a collision with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a boost following the Trump administration's plan to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted the export of advanced AI chips. A Department of Commerce spokesperson confirmed the decision, stating that the rule was overly complex and would hinder American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the administration's new direction, asserting that it would provide America with an opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the importance of balancing national security with access to chips to bolster the American chip industry. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had previously expressed concerns about being excluded from the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>Following a dog attack in New York City where a Chihuahua named Penny was mauled by two pit bulls, state lawmakers are proposing "Penny's Law." The proposed legislation aims to criminalize negligent dog handling and penalize owners who flee the scene of an attack. Currently, under New York law, dogs are considered property, which limits legal recourse in such incidents to civil matters. The attack on Penny sparked national outrage, highlighting the need for stronger accountability for dog owners.</p>
