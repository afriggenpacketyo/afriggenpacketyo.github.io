          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing during the summer for trade talks, following a trend of world leaders engaging with China. Albanese's visit, expected in July or August, aims to further ease economic tensions between Australia and China, which began easing import restrictions on Australian goods after Albanese's election in 2022. Engagement with China remains a priority for Albanese, especially after his Labor Party's recent election victory. This visit highlights Australia's focus on stabilizing its relationship with its largest trading partner amidst global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>A charity called Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complex medical needs, which can include chronic health issues and service-related injuries. Laura Meller, who has adopted three retired service animals, has spent thousands on their care and worries that rising vet costs could deter future adopters. Police dogs face risks in the line of duty, and advocates argue that providing financial support for their care is a matter of responsibility and ethical treatment. Nottinghamshire Police already provides pensions for its retired dogs, but the Home Office currently has no plans to change the national retirement process.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan is actively campaigning to bring Wrestlemania, WWE's largest annual event, to London, making a direct appeal to WWE executive Paul "Triple H" Levesque. Khan believes hosting Wrestlemania in London would not only be a great weekend but a full-fledged festival, showcasing wrestling legends, current stars, and future talents. This move would mark the first time Wrestlemania has been held outside of North America, potentially opening a new market for the WWE. Khan has been in talks with Levesque since 2024, emphasizing the potential economic and cultural benefits for London.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should take a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by utilizing its solar panel technology, potentially creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report suggests China must choose between its coal-fired plants and solar panels in Pakistan, as both cannot succeed in the same market. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions the financial viability of this vision, and the report also emphasizes the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing due to rising global trade tensions and export restrictions on critical minerals. The increasing influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, leading to stranded assets.</p>

The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that encourages engagement between travelers and local communities, fostering repeat visits. The agency also aims to remove barriers to travel, such as reluctance to take time off work, and highlights the success of initiatives like the "learcation" program in Aichi Prefecture. Despite sluggish traveler numbers, spending on domestic trips hit a record high in 2024, with hot springs and local food being the most popular themes.</p>

          <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a record $3.3 trillion in global energy investment for 2025, driven by a surge in clean energy spending. Clean energy technologies, including renewables, nuclear, and energy storage, are expected to attract $2.2 trillion, doubling the investment in fossil fuels. Solar power is expected to be the biggest beneficiary, with investment forecast to reach $450 billion, while spending on battery storage is predicted to surge to around $66 billion. The IEA warns that investment in grids needs to increase to maintain electricity security, and spending patterns remain uneven globally, with developing economies struggling to mobilize capital and China dominating clean energy investment.</p>
