          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago's O'Hare airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while heading to its gate. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who deplaned normally after a delay. The incident adds to recent concerns about aviation safety in the U.S., following several other runway collisions and near-misses at major airports. The stationary plane's horizontal stabilizer was struck in the low-speed event.</p>

          <p>A complex repair operation has begun to restore the main external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been precariously reliant on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the crucial repairs. The plant, Europe's largest, is under Russian control but needs reliable power to cool its shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough has set a new record as the oldest-ever winner of a Daytime Emmy award at the age of 99. He received the honor for his work on the Netflix documentary "Secret Lives of Orangutans," surpassing the previous record held by 98-year-old actor Dick Van Dyke. The documentary, which follows orangutans in Sumatra, also won two other awards at the ceremony. This achievement adds another accolade to Attenborough's celebrated career spanning over seven decades.</p>
