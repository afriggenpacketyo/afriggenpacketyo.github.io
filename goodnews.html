          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate backed by Ireland's left-wing opposition, secured a landslide victory in the presidential election with over 64.7% of the vote. Her campaign focused on themes of "peace," "unity," and "neutrality." Connolly, a 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, has been critical of the United States and the European Union, particularly regarding increased military spending and their roles in international conflicts. The election saw low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, reflecting widespread anger and dissatisfaction with all major parties, especially concerning issues like immigration and crime.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced for the New York City mayoral and New Jersey gubernatorial races, serving as potential indicators for the Democratic party's future strategy against Donald Trump's agenda. New York's mayoral contest features progressive Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo, with incumbent Eric Adams endorsing Cuomo after withdrawing. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli faces Democrat Mikie Sherrill. Both elections highlight issues of affordability, cost of living, and internal Democratic party divisions, with candidates clashing over policy proposals and controversial statements, including Mamdani's criticism of Israel.</p>

This direct involvement underscores Xi's personal stamp on China's future economic and social development strategies. The plan's formulation was informed by extensive fact-finding investigations conducted during Xi's tours across the country this year. The Politburo Standing Committee made multiple revisions before presenting the framework to the Central Committee for deliberation, signaling a highly centralized approach to national policy.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has strongly suggested she is considering another run for president in 2028, stating, "I am not done" with politics and that a woman will eventually occupy the White House. Despite trailing in current polls, the former vice president dismissed their significance, drawing on her past political successes. In a BBC interview, Harris criticized Donald Trump as a "tyrant" who weaponizes the justice system, citing the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after a joke. She also accused business leaders of capitulating to Trump's demands to gain power or avoid investigations, indicating a continued focus on national political discourse.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing" relies heavily on advanced technology, like the $3,050 Eight Sleep mattress cover that monitors vitals and adjusts temperature. However, a recent AWS Cloud outage demonstrated the pitfalls, leaving users with malfunctioning beds stuck at extreme temperatures. This incident highlights the increasing dependence on technology for basic bodily functions, turning sleep into a $29.3 billion industry projected to quadruple by 2034. While sleep tech can aid those with disorders, the article questions its overall effectiveness for general users and warns that adding more technology to a routine creates more potential points of failure, urging a simpler approach to rest.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a bionic jellyfish robot, dubbed an "underwater phantom," designed for stealthy deep-sea surveillance. Developed by Tao Kai from Northwestern Polytechnical University, the drone mimics a jellyfish's transparent form, umbrella-like body, and tentacles, using a hydrogel electrode material. Measuring just 120mm in diameter and weighing 56 grams, its low power consumption and near-silent operation make it ideal for covert monitoring, observing fragile ecosystems, and precise inspections of underwater structures. This innovation represents a significant advancement in autonomous underwater vehicle technology for various applications, showcasing new capabilities in maritime observation.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist offers guidance on setting limits with children effectively, beyond simply saying "no." The article emphasizes that boundaries, delivered with calm, consistency, and care, teach emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. Instead of just forbidding actions, parents should turn "no" into a teachable moment by explaining the "why" behind limits, especially those related to safety and kindness. Offering choices within boundaries empowers children, while consistent enforcement builds trust. Repairing communication after emotional reactions also teaches accountability and empathy, fostering stronger relationships as children grow and develop.</p>

Wambach also recommends that when attending games, parents should de-emphasize winning or losing and instead praise acts of leadership and good sportsmanship.
