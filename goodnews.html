While its third-quarter revenue of $15.23 billion slightly missed estimates, adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than anticipated. The airline's optimistic forecast is driven by its strategy of expanding capacity and investing in premium cabin experiences to attract high-value travelers. CEO Scott Kirby highlighted the growing success of the loyalty program, which is expected to double its earnings by the end of the decade, providing resilience against market volatility.

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to appoint Kevin Muscat as their new head coach. The 52-year-old Australian, a former defender for the club, is currently managing Shanghai Port in the Chinese Super League. An official announcement is being held up as Muscat's team has a crucial league match on Friday, and both parties are sensitive to disrupting preparations for the game. Finalizing personal terms and other details are the remaining steps before Muscat can officially take the helm at his former club.</p>

          <h2>EU Court Rules Pets in Aircraft Hold are 'Baggage,' Limiting Airline Liability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 13:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's highest court has ruled that pets transported in an aircraft's cargo hold are legally considered "baggage," not "passengers." This advisory judgment limits an airline's financial liability for the loss of an animal to the same level as lost luggage. The case was brought by a Spanish woman whose dog escaped while being loaded onto an Iberia flight in Buenos Aires and was never recovered. The court clarified that unless a passenger pays an extra fee and makes a special declaration of interest, the standard compensation limits for baggage apply, a decision with significant implications for traveling pet owners.</p>

          <p>The United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, has been officially designated a "heat hazard" by Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, due to an unseasonal heatwave. With temperatures forecast to exceed 31°C (88°F), the designation triggers a rule allowing drivers the option to use in-car cooling vests to combat potentially dangerous conditions. This is the second consecutive race to receive this classification, highlighting the increasing impact of extreme weather on the sport. While some drivers welcome the safety measure, others find the vests uncomfortable, creating a debate about performance versus protection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While high-yield savings accounts remain more profitable than traditional ones, savers must adapt their strategies as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates. Financial experts advise avoiding several costly mistakes, such as exclusively using local brick-and-mortar banks, which typically offer lower rates than online competitors. It is also recommended to consider splitting funds with a fixed-rate Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in current high rates before they fall further. Despite declining returns, these accounts still offer significant value and flexibility compared to standard savings options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans for a new monument in the nation's capital, a large arch informally dubbed the "Arc de Trump." The structure, officially named the "Independence Arch," is modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is slated for construction on the Virginia side of the Memorial Bridge. Trump showcased models of the arch at a White House dinner for wealthy donors, expressing his preference for the largest version. The project is intended to be completed for the nation's 250th anniversary, but details on its cost and funding have not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>Soybeans have become a cornerstone of the global food system, primarily as the main protein source for livestock feed rather than for direct human consumption. The U.S. is the world's second-largest producer, with most of its exports historically going to China to feed its massive pork and poultry industries. The recent trade war initiated by the Trump administration has disrupted this relationship, causing U.S. soy sales to plummet while benefiting producers in South America. While politically significant for farm states, the conflict highlights the inefficient use of a highly productive crop that could be used more sustainably to feed people directly.</p>

Top diplomat Kaja Kallas presented a "defense readiness roadmap," stating that such defenses are "no longer optional" due to increasing airspace incursions by Russia. The initiative is part of a broader push to bolster the EU's eastern flank and better integrate member states' armies and defense industries. The plan also proposes the creation of European Air and Space Shields to counter missile threats and protect space assets.</p>

For those priced out of the gold market, silver presents a lower entry point with the potential for continued growth. Given ongoing economic and geopolitical instability, investing in silver is presented as a timely strategy for both new and experienced investors. (not investment advice)</p>
