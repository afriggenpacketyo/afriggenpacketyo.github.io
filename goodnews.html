        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO raised $4.6 billion, making it the largest global listing in 2025, and the funds will primarily be used to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China, CATL's global expansion faces challenges, including tariffs on Chinese EVs and U.S.-China trade tensions, with the Pentagon placing it on a watchlist over suspected military links.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working long hours to pass President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction package, facing internal divisions and tight deadlines. The House Budget Committee convened late at night to advance the bill, and the Rules Committee scheduled a meeting at 1 a.m. to prepare it for the floor. The late-night sessions are driven by parliamentary procedure and the need to accommodate Democratic input, but also serve to diminish attendance and expedite the process. The article draws a parallel between the Republicans' efforts and Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks," depicting figures trying to make it through the night.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, the deals required politically difficult concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished economic position post-Brexit. The agreement with the EU will generate benefits but adds only a small percentage to Britain's GDP, while the deal with the U.S. still leaves Britain worse off than before Trump's tariffs. The article suggests Britain is squeezed between a mercantilist EU and a predatory U.S. in a challenging global trade environment.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric cars, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. The stock sale, the largest globally this year, raised $4.6 billion but was structured as a Reg S offering to exclude U.S. investors. This move highlights the growing financial decoupling between the two countries, with the U.S. government targeting Chinese companies over national security concerns. Experts suggest this trend may extend to other Chinese hardware and software producers, limiting U.S. investor access to potentially profitable opportunities.</p>

          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this indicates a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to the trade war and China's economic recovery.</p>

The research will assess the behavior of seaweed at considerable depths and the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects.

          <p>China's central bank cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, in an effort to stimulate its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate was reduced to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This decision follows earlier moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce their deposit rates, aiming to protect their net interest margin. Analysts expect further policy easing, with forecasts of additional rate cuts by year-end, supported by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions.</p>
