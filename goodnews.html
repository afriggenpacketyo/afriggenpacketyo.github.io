          <p>A new educational initiative is being trialed in primary schools across Kent, England, teaching children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future skin cancer cases. The program, which covers topics like UV indexes and proper sunscreen application, aims for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the initiative seeks to instill lifelong habits and empower the next generation to protect themselves from harmful UV exposure, addressing a growing public health concern.</p>

          <p>Japan's 50th and final H2A rocket successfully launched from Tanegashima Island, marking the end of the series' distinguished 24-year career in the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, placed a government satellite into orbit to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate over its lifetime, is being retired in favor of the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This transition is part of Japan's strategy to remain competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by commercial entities like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration for human rights and solidarity against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was seen as a direct response to the government's attempts to ban the event under a controversial 2021 law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, celebrated the march as a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The event highlighted the deep political and cultural divisions within Hungary over LGBTQ rights and freedom of assembly.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators have agreed to continue discussions on tariffs, aiming for a mutually beneficial trade deal, though significant differences reportedly persist. The talks, held in Washington between Japan's top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, are focused on trade expansion and economic security. A major point of contention appears to be the U.S. treatment of Japan's automotive industry. Both sides described the discussions as "fruitful" but acknowledged the need for further negotiations as a July deadline for a potential agreement looms. (not investment advice)</p>

Over two innings, Ohtani threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and recorded his fastest-ever MLB pitch at 101.7 mph, later hitting 102 mph. While his workload remains limited, the outing demonstrated his dominant potential with a triple-digit fastball and effective off-speed pitches.

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the U.S. remains far ahead in semiconductor production, a gap that poses a major challenge for Chinese tech firms. However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. models using a fraction of the computing power. This suggests China is making strategic breakthroughs in algorithm engineering to overcome its hardware constraints.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected another attempt by President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five dismissed. U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The five men sued Trump for defamation in October, citing statements he made during a presidential debate where he falsely claimed they had killed someone and pled guilty. This ruling marks the latest setback for Trump in his efforts to end the lawsuit.</p>
