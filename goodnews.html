          <p>A debate is brewing within the Republican Party over whether to raise taxes on millionaires as part of President Trump's "grand and beautiful" fiscal plan. While Trump has expressed interest in the idea, he has also backtracked, and House Speaker Mike Johnson opposes it. The issue is creating a rift between traditional Republicans who oppose tax increases and populist nationalists who see it as a way to generate revenue and ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. The debate centers on extending the 2017 tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year, and whether to offset the cost with spending cuts or tax increases on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The New York State Legislature passed a $254 billion budget that includes benefits for both lawmakers and citizens. Legislators delayed enforcement of an outside income cap and altered campaign finance rules to benefit incumbents. The budget also includes an "inflation rebate" for New Yorkers, increased per-day pay for jurors, and assistance for online shoppers. Additionally, the budget addresses staffing shortages in corrections by allowing younger people to become officers and raising the maximum age for State Police recruits, as well as tightening regulations on artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack stated that the Federal Reserve needs more time to assess the economic impact of President Trump's tariff and other policies before making decisions on interest rates. She noted that the economy has been resilient, but the effects of the administration's policies are still unclear. Hammack emphasized the importance of monitoring the job market and the potential impact of tariffs on employment, suggesting that the Fed's response will depend on the data as it unfolds.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the classic 60-40 portfolio is no longer suitable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing longevity. Edelman suggests that investors should allocate 70% to 80% of their portfolios to equities to ensure they have enough money to last through potentially longer lifespans. He emphasizes that breakthroughs in health and science are expected to extend lifespans, making it necessary to invest more aggressively.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appears poised to temporarily block the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston indicated that the president must seek Congressional approval for such significant changes.

The judge questioned the administration's claim of "inherent authority" and suggested a temporary restraining order is necessary to protect the power of the legislative branch.</p>
