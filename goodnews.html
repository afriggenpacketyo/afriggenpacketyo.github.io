        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third consecutive year, with New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa also ranking high. The report analyzes tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. The article advises consulting a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen, as they could be indicative of a cold, virus, or asthma.</p>

          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the United Kingdom have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles are experiencing a significant surge. The UK has become a popular destination for Chinese car brands, with plug-in hybrid vehicle exports increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. The report highlights that the UK imposes a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the European Union, which is considering higher tariffs, up to 45.3 per cent, on Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, challenges the notion of the 'perfect mother,' arguing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance. She critiques the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and highlights the pressure mothers face from various sources. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their imperfections and stop striving for an unattainable ideal, offering a quiz to illustrate common parenting moments of imperfection. The article concludes with a message of reassurance, urging mothers to recognize that they are good enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but lower than the previous year. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season as sales of previously occupied homes decline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the initial discussions as being "very good" and said change had been "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner". An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. Following months of back-and-forth, the two countries are meeting in Geneva this weekend for the first time since Trump hit China with tariffs at the start of the year.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. A report by ODI Global reveals that Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, experiencing a 153% surge in exports from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's growing focus on renewable energy and its commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas. Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production are driving this trend.</p>
