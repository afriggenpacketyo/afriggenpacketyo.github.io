          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A six-story facility called "The Reserve" near Singapore's airport, holding about $1.5 billion in gold and silver, has seen an 88% increase in storage orders since the start of the year. Singapore is considered a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, and the wealthy are opting for physical gold bars over paper to avoid counterparty and geopolitical risks. The rise in gold prices has been fueled by volatility from U.S.-China trade tensions and a mass U.S. asset sell-off.</p>

Despite facing challenging weather conditions, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, citing the alarming rate at which they are killed globally.

The rise in detections is attributed to increased submissions and more aggressive policies against "incentivized reviews." Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews. The company identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with boosting and member fraud being the most common.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers continued to fall due to fears of a price war and increased scrutiny from regulators. BYD shares plunged after the company announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, which are then resold as secondhand vehicles. An analyst expects BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the price cuts, but anticipates the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.</p>

The Hong Kong Journalists Association reported that at least 20 members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million following a tax review.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures, supported by Beijing's policy measures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. The growth was largely attributed to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some negative impacts from U.S. tariffs. While some industries faced headwinds, such as the automobile and apparel sectors, overall profitability improved due to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes for his film "It Was Just Accident," has returned home to Tehran. Panahi, who has faced imprisonment and travel bans in Iran, was greeted by friends and fellow filmmakers upon his arrival. His win sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, with the French Foreign Minister calling it a "gesture of resistance" against the Iranian regime. Panahi's return fulfills a pledge he made at Cannes, where he called for Iranians to "join forces" and fight for freedom.</p>

          <p>High-end jewellery designs are incorporating hidden mechanisms and subtle details to create pieces with personal narratives and emotional resonance. Swiss jewellery house G√ºbelin integrates rubies into less visible areas of their creations, symbolizing a passion for gems and inviting wearers to forge personal connections. Other designers use concealed locations for gems or incorporate materials like hair or wood to create reminders of loved ones or special moments. These pieces offer a private connection to the wearer, emphasizing that true beauty lives beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered.</p>
