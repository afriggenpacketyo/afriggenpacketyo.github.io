          <p>Home Depot's stock rose by 3% after the company maintained its full-year sales growth forecast, signaling confidence despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The retailer reported seeing encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and sales growth in most merchandising departments. This performance comes amid a persistent "deferral mindset" from homeowners, who cite general economic uncertainty as the primary reason for postponing large projects. The company's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, signaling a potential move into vehicle production in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina S.A.U. to not only import and sell vehicles but also to manufacture and service them, along with their batteries and parts. This development follows the company's 2017 investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina and its recent announcement of regional expansion plans. If production begins, it would mark BYD's second vehicle factory in Latin America, following a major project in Brazil.</p>

The number of beverage offerings has grown over 9%, with a strong emphasis on cold drinks, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This shift reflects a trend where beverages are becoming the primary reason for a customer's visit, rather than just an add-on to a food order.

          <p>In the newly formatted US Open mixed doubles event, the team of Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper defeated the high-profile pairing of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz. The match, played in a party-like atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium, was part of a reimagined tournament structure designed to attract top singles players with a $1 million prize. Despite the loss, Raducanu and Alcaraz were crowd favorites, with both teams appearing to enjoy the less formal competition.

The company stated it is evaluating various products to compete where governments permit, ensuring all offerings are approved for commercial use. This development comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their sales in China in exchange for resuming chip sales. President Trump has indicated he might be open to a deal allowing a scaled-down version of Nvidia's advanced Blackwell chip in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The back-to-school shopping season is being shaped by consumer concerns over tariffs and inflation, leading families to seek out value and start shopping earlier. This environment is expected to benefit value-oriented retailers like TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon, which are well-positioned to attract budget-conscious shoppers. While overall spending is projected to decline slightly compared to last year, these companies can leverage their flexible pricing models, private-label brands, and discount events like Prime Day. Other retailers may face tighter profit margins as they absorb costs to avoid alienating price-sensitive consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

With over 4 million boomers turning 80 in the next five years, demand for senior housing is rising rapidly, while new inventory growth has fallen below 1% for the first time since 2006. High interest rates and development costs are constraining new construction, creating what experts call a brewing problem.
