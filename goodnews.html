        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent public displays of emotion by figures like Chancellor Rachel Reeves have sparked a conversation about the acceptability of crying at work. While some still view it as a sign of weakness that could hinder career progression, many experts and workers now see it as a sign of emotional intelligence and strength. The article explores how perceptions are changing, with many organizations beginning to value authenticity and compassionate leadership. It notes that while a bias against showing emotion persists in some environments, creating a supportive atmosphere where employees feel safe to be vulnerable can lead to greater motivation and loyalty.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Storing Atmospheric Carbon, New Research Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial in combating global warming by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These organisms gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively sequestering the carbon for centuries. Researchers calculated this process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, stores about 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. This discovery highlights the underappreciated but vital role these small creatures play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong support for a decade-old proposal by Warren Buffett to control the national deficit. Buffett's idea, stated in a 2011 interview, was to pass a law making all sitting members of Congress ineligible for reelection if the federal deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. Musk endorsed the concept on social media with a "100%" and "This is the way," adding significant momentum to the idea amid growing public frustration over government spending and accountability. While translating the idea into policy would be difficult, Musk's backing amplifies the call for greater fiscal discipline in Washington.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted them with an egg from another pair to improve the chick's chances of survival, a common practice in conservation breeding programs. This event is part of a successful breeding season for the zoo's colony of Humboldt penguins, which are listed as a vulnerable species. The article notes that same-sex penguin parenting is not uncommon and represents a positive development for the international conservation efforts for the species.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the performance was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, and her participation in the rest of the tournament is now in serious doubt. The win provides a solid start for Germany, but the loss of their captain could be a significant blow as they prepare to face tougher opponents.</p>

He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, as well as deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils.
