          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:12:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo has announced the launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, set to be available this fall, as it adapts to declining traditional soda sales. This move follows the company's recent acquisition of Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, and reflects a broader strategy to appeal to health-conscious consumers. The new beverage will contain three grams of prebiotic fiber and five grams of cane sugar, positioning it competitively against rivals like Olipop. The launch comes as PepsiCo's North American beverage volume has shrunk, highlighting the company's pivot towards functional and healthier drink options.</p>

          <p>Musician Jonathan Singletary has cultivated a dedicated online community through his weekly Instagram Live series, "Piano & Prayer." Started during the pandemic as an antidote to isolation, the sessions blend improvised piano music, meditation, and shared prayer in a welcoming, non-denominational spiritual space. Viewers from across the country tune in to connect, share their thoughts, and offer support to one another in the chat. The series reflects a growing trend of people identifying as spiritual rather than religious, finding connection and solace outside of traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with high credit card debt, a debt management program can be a viable solution, but enrollment typically requires meeting specific criteria. The article outlines three primary requirements: having a steady and sufficient income to make consistent payments, possessing a manageable amount of unsecured debt within the program's limits, and demonstrating a willingness to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts. These programs aim to streamline payments and lower interest rates but are designed for those who can adhere to a disciplined financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that the 700 U.S. Marines sent to Los Angeles a month ago will begin to withdraw from the city. The troops were deployed in early June amid large-scale federal immigration raids and protests, a move that was fiercely denounced by local officials as an inappropriate use of military force. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the withdrawal was directed as stability has returned to the city, crediting the Marines' presence with restoring order. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal a "win for Los Angeles," reiterating that the military's presence on city streets was inappropriate.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, shared his top survival tips amid recent shark sightings. He advises to first and foremost stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract the shark. Secondly, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer an easy, unaware target. As a final resort, he suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose or gills rather than punching it. De Gelder is demonstrating these techniques in a new Discovery Channel special to help educate the public on shark safety.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a landmark moment for Muslim and South Asian Americans, signaling growing political influence. The 33-year-old assemblyman's campaign, which focused on affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters and grassroots organizations. His rise is seen as a sign of hope in a city where Islamophobia surged after 9/11, challenging assumptions about who can represent New York. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's success reflects a shift within the Democratic base and has made him a popular figure among Muslims nationwide.</p>

As these limits may not cover the full cost of attendance, especially at private universities, the article suggests that students may need to consider private student loans to fill the remaining financial gap.

While Frey's campaign is appealing the result, citing procedural flaws, the endorsement provides momentum for the progressive left in the city. The outcome is not final, as Minneapolis uses ranked-choice voting in its November general election, and Frey previously won elections without the party's endorsement.</p>
