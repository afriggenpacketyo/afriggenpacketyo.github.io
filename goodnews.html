          <p>President Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system by the end of his term, similar to Israel's Iron Dome. U.S. officials state the system is needed to protect against catastrophic attacks, but experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. The project, a priority for Trump, faces potential cost overruns, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating costs between $161 billion and $542 billion. The article notes that the system aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, even space, but technical challenges exist due to America's vast territory.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the Trump administration suspended its funding, accusing it of liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas stated the funding serves as a 'safety net for independent journalism,' crucial for resisting authoritarian regimes.

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. This loss halts the momentum progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold, with O'Connor positioning himself as a pragmatic candidate focused on rebuilding the city's tax base. The article notes that questions about police leadership, budget issues, and basic services overshadowed Gainey's economic gains. O'Connor will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since 1932.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours, with surgeons describing it as a 'game changer.' The method has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumor. The article notes that the new technique allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery, if needed, at the time of the original procedure. The faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy, more quickly, and that the quicker diagnoses often reduced the anxiety patients felt while waiting for test results.</p>
