          <p>A California family's "Green Idea House" has been generating more energy than it consumes for over a decade, offering a blueprint for sustainable living at a cost comparable to traditional construction. By eliminating gas lines, installing solar panels, and employing smart design features like roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling, the home saves approximately $4,800 annually in utility bills. The project highlights the importance of meticulous planning and adapting to a changing climate, demonstrating that energy independence is achievable with off-the-shelf technology.</p>

          <p>A youth-led protest movement in Nepal, largely organized by Gen Z activists, has successfully forced the resignation of the prime minister amid widespread anger over government corruption and unemployment. The demonstrations escalated after police opened fire on protesters, leading to violent clashes and the prime minister's departure. Following the upheaval, Nepal has appointed its first female prime minister, 73-year-old former chief justice Sushila Karki, in a move seen as a victory for the anti-corruption movement.</p>

As deforestation and conflict have made traditional bushmeat scarcer, organizations are now promoting the farming of these insects to combat food insecurity.</p>

          <p>South African police have successfully dismantled a large-scale crystal methamphetamine laboratory on a farm in the east of the country, seizing drugs with an estimated street value of $20 million. During the raid, five individuals from a North American country were arrested, while two others, believed to be from West African nations, managed to escape. The operation highlights South Africa's ongoing struggle as both a major consumer market and a key transit point for illicit drugs due to its geography and porous borders.</p>

          <p>U.S. water and wastewater facilities are facing an increasing number of severe cyberattacks from foreign adversaries, including Iran and China, threatening a critical infrastructure sector that is often underfunded and understaffed. In response, a new volunteer initiative called Project Franklin is pairing cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON hacker community with small-town water operators to improve their digital defenses. The effort aims to address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited to disrupt the nation's clean water supply.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Offers Strategies to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book explores the neuroscience behind "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy explains that while this state is common in early love, it can become a form of addiction if the feelings are unreciprocated or uncertain, leading to anxiety and craving. The article outlines strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, reframing fantasies negatively, and finding new personal goals to shift focus and regain emotional control.</p>

          <p>Following significant gains in the last general election, the UK's Liberal Democrat party is now contemplating its future strategy and political identity. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful publicity stunts have successfully garnered attention, polling suggests voters may want the party to adopt a more serious tone. As the two major parties grapple with internal divisions, the Lib Dems see an opportunity to appeal to centrist voters but must define a clear economic platform and find ways to make moderate positions exciting to the electorate.</p>

While the groups are useful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, many parents find them overwhelming due to the constant notifications and competitive parenting chatter. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups altogether to avoid the anxiety and background noise, raising questions about the role of such informal digital communities.</p>
