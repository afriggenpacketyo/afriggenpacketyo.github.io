          <p>The UK and US have unveiled a landmark agreement to accelerate nuclear power development, aiming to generate thousands of jobs and significantly bolster Britain's energy security. Expected to be signed during President Trump's state visit, this deal is projected to unlock billions in private investment, including a proposal from X-Energy and Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially powering 1.5 million homes. The broader program could be worth £40bn, with £12bn focused in the north-east of England, and also includes collaboration on fusion energy and ending reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed this as building a "golden age of nuclear" at the forefront of global innovation.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants, despite falling to 0-2 after a thrilling overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, demonstrated a significant improvement in performance and watchability compared to their season opener. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational game with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, forging a strong connection with Malik Nabers, though persistent penalties hindered the team. Meanwhile, Daniel Jones has led the Indianapolis Colts to a 2-0 start, and the Los Angeles Rams are also undefeated. The Cincinnati Bengals face uncertainty with a toe injury to Joe Burrow, while the Kansas City Chiefs are surprisingly 0-2, and the Pittsburgh Steelers suffered a catastrophic kickoff return error.</p>

          <p>Data from the People's Bank of China indicates a sustained and robust shift of household savings into mainland China's US$12.7 trillion stock market, suggesting the current rally has considerable room to run. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions rose by 1.17 trillion yuan in August, marking a second consecutive month of significant increases. The article attributes this trend to low-interest-rate policies that are squeezing returns from traditional banking deposits, prompting capital to seek better returns in the capital market. The earnings yield of China’s biggest listed companies is now 5.5%, significantly higher than government bonds or demand deposit interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

BBC bosses are reportedly keen to steer media attention back to the competition itself, following recent controversies including an investigation into alleged drug use and an unnamed star's arrest on suspicion of sexual assault. Contestants largely dismissed the notion of the "Strictly curse," with many highlighting the opportunity to showcase their true personalities and enjoy the unique experience, promising a mix of dazzling performances and personal journeys.</p>

          <p>Host Nate Bargatze's central bit at the Emmy Awards, which penalized long acceptance speeches by deducting from a $100,000 charity donation, ultimately detracted from the ceremony's emotional and spontaneous moments. While intended to keep the show concise, the article argues this strategy led to speakers rushing their thank-yous and apologizing to the children representing the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, making the worthy cause feel like a punchline. Despite unexpected wins and heartfelt messages from recipients like Jeff Hiller and Stephen Colbert, the host's persistent focus on time often overshadowed the substance of the awards, diminishing the genuine reactions and sincerity from winners.</p>
