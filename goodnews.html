          <h2>Workplace Cardiac Arrests Increasing, Often Fatal Due to Lack of Preparedness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 11:48:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study highlights the increasing incidence of cardiac arrests in U.S. workplaces, affecting over 10,000 people annually. Unlike high-profile cases where immediate medical attention is available, most workplaces are ill-equipped to handle such emergencies. The American Heart Association reports that 7 in 10 Americans feel unprepared to act during a cardiac emergency, leading to a 90% fatality rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Efforts are underway to improve bystander confidence in performing CPR, but significant gaps remain in workplace preparedness and response capabilities. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price have surpassed $40 billion, indicating strong investor interest. Senate is advancing legislation to create the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins, further boosting market confidence. Analysts suggest that upcoming government actions, regulatory progress, and corporate treasury investments could drive Bitcoin prices even higher. (not investment advice) </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 11:43:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is planning to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with underlying health conditions, pending newer clinical trials. This potential policy change is based on arguments that annual booster shots may not be worth the risk for healthy individuals, and it aligns with recommendations from countries like the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Experts caution that lengthy clinical trials may result in vaccines that are ineffective against current variants, and that the FDA is overstepping the CDC's recommending capacity. The new framework could affect insurance coverage and access to vaccines for those wanting to protect vulnerable family members. </p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives are urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline the visa processing system for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. They fear that proposed cost-cutting measures could increase visa wait times, potentially impacting attendance and economic activity. The 2026 World Cup is expected to generate $3.75 billion in economic activity in the U.S., with Southern California anticipated to benefit significantly. Concerns are being raised over potential conflicts between the administration's desire for welcoming foreign visitors and stricter immigration enforcement policies. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments following political pressure. More than nine million pensioners lost eligibility for the payments after the pension top-up was tightened. The changes will be implemented at the autumn Budget, with details on the new threshold to be announced later. The policy change comes after criticism from unions, pensioner charities, and Labour MPs, who blamed the policy for recent election losses. </p>
