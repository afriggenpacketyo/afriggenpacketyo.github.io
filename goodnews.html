          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will continue as chairman. This decision, revealed during the company's annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will oversee company operations and capital deployment. Buffett's continued presence as chairman is expected to aid Abel, 62, with significant acquisition opportunities, given Berkshire's substantial cash reserves. The announcement had minimal impact on Berkshire shares, which remain strong with a market value exceeding $1.1 trillion.</p>

          <p>Japan and India have agreed to deepen defense cooperation, including discussions to establish a senior officer-level dialogue body, in response to China's increasing military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

          <p>Temu, the China-based online retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs. This change means Temu's Chinese-sourced products now face tariffs as high as 145%, undermining its appeal to U.S. consumers. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all U.S. sales handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from within the country, and is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, is balancing his critique of President Trump with a commitment to bipartisanship as he seeks reelection in 2026 in a state that Trump carried in 2024. Ossoff, who gained prominence for challenging Trump, emphasizes delivering for Georgia while finding opportunities to collaborate with the administration and Republicans. While he criticizes Trump's attempts to use the government to suppress critics, he also stresses the importance of reclaiming the House and Senate. Ossoff faces challenges from both sides, including criticism from Democrats for not confronting Trump strongly enough and attacks from Republicans who view his 2020 election as a fluke.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, recommending Greg Abel as his successor. Abel, currently overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance companies, joined the firm in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest wind energy producer in the country. While considered more hands-on than Buffett, Abel is well-regarded by Berkshire's managers and praised for his business acumen. Despite the challenges of matching Buffett's performance, Abel's appointment is seen as a positive step for the company's future.</p>

          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry indicates that more American adults with mental health needs are seeking talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications without therapy has decreased. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving psychotherapy rose from 6.5% to 8.5%, and the use of medication alone declined. This trend, supported by the expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of more licensed counselors and social workers as providers, suggests that talk therapy is becoming more accessible. However, the study notes that affluent individuals are benefiting the most from this increased access.</p>

Ari Ne'eman, a disability rights advocate, points to the successful fight against Reagan-era rollbacks as a model, emphasizing the importance of both grassroots mobilization and reframing disability rights priorities to appeal across the political spectrum. He stresses the need to monitor potential cuts to home and community-based services and the impact on disabled individuals and their families.
