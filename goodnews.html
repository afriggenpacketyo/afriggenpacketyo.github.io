          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta infringed upon the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that the company removed the account, which had over five million followers, without a clear justification and applied its nudity policies inconsistently compared to similar accounts. This ruling mandates that Meta must review its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions and more precisely define its rules on sexual content, highlighting a significant legal check on the power of social media platforms.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team faces a monumental challenge against England in the World Cup quarter-final, a rival they have not defeated in over 25 years. The article reflects on Scotland's last victory in 1999, contrasting the past era with the sport's current professional landscape. While England has consistently dominated recent matchups, Scotland has shown significant improvement, rising in world rankings. The match is set against a backdrop of uncertainty over Scottish players' contracts, yet there is a strong belief within the team that they can defy history and compete against the heavily favored English side.</p>

          <p>Experts are split on the winner of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford's supporters point to his superior technical skill, adaptability, and ability to expose vulnerabilities in opponents, believing he can overcome the significant weight difference by out-boxing the aging champion. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at the 168lb super-middleweight class will be insurmountable for Crawford, who is moving up two divisions. They contend that while Crawford is a master boxer, Canelo's strength and ability to control the ring will ultimately prove decisive.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has sworn in its first female prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The interim leader's appointment comes after intense negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives. President Ram Chandra Poudel has dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5. With a curfew eased and troops withdrawn, a sense of calm is returning to Kathmandu after the unrest, which was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously address China's declining birth rate and bolster its scientific workforce, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women under 40 who are returning to their scientific careers after childbirth. Initially covering 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to ease the transition back to work and retain valuable talent in the competitive research sector. This policy reflects a targeted approach to tackling two of the nation's major strategic priorities.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill that would largely prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks that obscure their identities while on duty. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, was prompted by federal immigration raids where agents concealed their faces, sparking fear and protest. Supporters argue the measure promotes transparency and public trust, while opponents, including law enforcement agencies, claim it would endanger officers by exposing their identities to potential threats and harassment. The bill includes exceptions for undercover operations and certain tactical situations.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record-breaking pre-order sales in China, indicating robust demand despite some shipment delays. Within the first minute of availability, sales on the e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 model. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, and in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within 20 minutes. This strong start suggests Apple's continued market strength in China, a crucial region for the company's global performance. (not investment advice)</p>
