          <p>Hooters is planning to make its iconic orange shorts less revealing as part of a broader brand reinvention. The move is being led by Hooters Inc. CEO Neil Kiefer, who aims to reclaim the original 1980s "athletic" dolphin-short style, shifting away from the more sexualized look that became prevalent. This change comes as the original Hooters group plans to take over locations previously operated by Hooters of America, which filed for bankruptcy, in an effort to make the chain more approachable for families and a wider customer base.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was highlighted by a controversial team order from McLaren. The team instructed Oscar Piastri to allow his teammate Lando Norris to pass for second place after a slow pit stop, caused by a wheel gun fault, had reversed their on-track positions. While McLaren defended the decision as fair based on Norris's race pace, Piastri expressed his disagreement over the radio before complying, sparking debate about the fairness of interfering with outcomes affected by mechanical issues during a race.</p>

Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a ruthless display by the reigning champions. The victory not only ensures a theoretically easier quarter-final draw for New Zealand but also serves as revenge for a defeat to Ireland in the WXV1 tournament last year. Ireland, despite the loss, had already qualified for the quarter-finals.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound and vibrated as part of the second national test of the government's emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM on Sunday, was intended to ensure the system's readiness for use in major emergencies like severe weather or public safety threats. While the Prime Minister's office stated that tens of millions of phones successfully received the alert, some users reported receiving garbled or incomplete messages, indicating potential areas for improvement in the system's reliability.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has declared Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, a saint, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a devout Catholic and self-taught computer programmer who used his skills to create a website documenting miracles, spreading his faith online. His canonization, which required the verification of two miracles attributed to his intercession, has resonated strongly with young Catholics, who see him as a modern example of holiness.</p>

Researchers theorize that individuals with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other due to shared understanding, similar environments, or perceived limited dating prospects.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is the most critical foundation parents can provide for their children's long-term health and success. Consistent, deep sleep is vital for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and good habits formed early can lead to better learning, concentration, and resilience later in life. He advises parents to create a soothing environment, involve both caretakers in settling the baby, and maintain a flexible routine to teach infants to sleep soundly.</p>

It contrasts the simplicity, longevity, and independence of a personal solar panel and battery system with the complex, failure-prone, and interdependent infrastructure required for fossil fuels. By providing a truly off-grid power source, solar energy aligns perfectly with the conservative ideals of individualism and resilience in the face of potential societal breakdown.</p>
