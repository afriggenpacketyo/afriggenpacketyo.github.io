          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, asserts that artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a "super cycle" that could span 15 to 20 years, profoundly changing the world. He notes significant shifts like Silicon Valley's resurgence and the empowerment of sole founders through AI-driven coding. While acknowledging a potential "bubble" due to overvaluation, Ganguly emphasizes the long-term impact on sectors beyond consumer tech, such as healthcare and climate, and highlights India's emergence in developing AI-native applications. This article offers an optimistic outlook on AI's transformative power, despite the acknowledged market frothiness. (not investment advice)</p>

Rising 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below, it surpasses the previous record holder, the Duge Bridge, by approximately 60 meters. The bridge also claims the title of the world's longest mountain bridge, spanning 2,890 meters across the "Earth's crack" gorge.

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors and publishers who accused the firm of using nearly half a million pirated books to train its chatbots. The settlement, which will compensate authors approximately $3,000 per book, aims to resolve claims about how materials were obtained, though a prior ruling found AI training to be transformative fair use. This article marks a significant milestone in authors' fight against AI companies' alleged intellectual property theft, signaling a crucial push for legal acquisition of content for future AI development.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by loud commercials, seeks to regulate streaming ad volumes, mirroring federal laws for traditional broadcasters. Introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, the bill has passed the state Senate but stalled in the Assembly due to opposition from the Motion Picture Association, which cites implementation challenges for smaller streaming services. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill's impact in California could effectively set a national standard, as companies often avoid creating separate policies for the state. This article highlights growing consumer frustration and California's significant influence on industry practices.</p>
