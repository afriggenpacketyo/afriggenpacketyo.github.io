          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant victory in his civil lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell, as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled he is not required to participate in arbitration overseen by Goodell. The court determined that Gruden's resignation made him exempt from the NFL Constitution's arbitration mandate, stating that forcing him into arbitration would be "unconscionable." This decision appears to pave the way for Gruden's lawsuit, which alleges a "malicious and orchestrated campaign" to destroy his career through leaked emails, to proceed in state court. Gruden's attorney expressed satisfaction, stating the victory validates his client's reputation and clears the path to justice.</p>

Uber is a major investor in Waabi, and Uber Freight has been a key partner in testing its autonomous trucking technology.

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% decline in net income in its first fiscal quarter since new tariffs were announced, despite its strong track record of 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth. CEO Tarang Amin remains focused on the company's long-term consistency, international expansion, and the significant $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. This strategic deal will bring E.l.f. into Sephora stores and aims to leverage cross-platform engagement among its consumers. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about the acquisition's potential to be accretive, despite the debt financing, as E.l.f. continues to challenge legacy beauty brands.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve shifts towards potential rate cuts, savers are evaluating whether money market accounts or high-yield savings accounts are more ideal for their financial situations. Both account types offer variable interest rates higher than standard savings accounts, with comparable annual percentage yields (APYs) often ranging between 3.4% and 3.5%. The primary distinction lies in accessibility, as money market accounts typically provide a debit card and check-writing capabilities, unlike most high-yield savings accounts. Experts suggest money market accounts for larger nest eggs requiring occasional access, while high-yield savings are better suited for emergency funds or short-term goals, emphasizing the importance of comparing APYs and minimums.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the year-end approaches, retirees aged 73 and older face deadlines for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from pretax retirement accounts, with several options available if the money isn't immediately needed. For those seeking continued long-term growth, reinvesting RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, particularly using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for tax efficiency, is a viable strategy. Charitable individuals can consider Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs), directly transferring up to $108,000 from an IRA to an eligible non-profit, which can satisfy RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be used for legacy planning by contributing to a 529 college savings plan for family members, potentially offering state tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
