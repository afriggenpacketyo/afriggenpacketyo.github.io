          <p>A new documentary, "Shenzhou 13," offers an unprecedented 8K ultra-high-definition view of life on China's Tiangong space station. Filmed by the astronauts themselves during their six-month mission, the production has captivated audiences, including renowned science fiction author Liu Cixin. The writer of "The Three-Body Problem" expressed excitement at the premiere, viewing the film as a realization of science fiction visions. He noted that China's ambitious space exploration goals, such as a planned lunar landing in 2030, continue to blur the lines between fiction and reality, inspiring hope for broader access to space travel in the future.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a significant surge in popularity in Turkey, driven by young people seeking better educational and career opportunities abroad. Due to Turkey's challenging economic conditions and stressful work environments, many students view Germany as a gateway to a more stable future. Elite Turkish high schools now see a large percentage of graduates heading to German universities, and language courses are consistently oversubscribed. This trend reflects a broader desire among Turkish youth to gain skills that open doors to the international job market, with Germany being a particularly attractive destination.</p>

          <p>The Ashland County Fair in Ohio is hosting its "Fight the Hunger, Stock the Trailer" contest for the third consecutive year, encouraging community and youth participation in a large-scale food drive. The event, sponsored by Farm Credit Mid-America, aims to collect non-perishable food items for local food banks, addressing food insecurity within the community. In previous years, the fair has successfully collected over 15,800 pounds of food. The initiative not only provides essential aid to families in need but also offers cash awards to local 4-H programs, fostering a spirit of community service among young leaders.</p>

          <p>Small colleges across the U.S., such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are reintroducing football programs after decades of absence in an effort to boost student enrollment, particularly among men. Facing a nationwide trend of fewer men attending college, administrators hope that the sport, along with marching bands and cheerleading, will create a more vibrant campus life and attract more male applicants. While research suggests that the enrollment spike from adding football may be short-lived, these institutions see it as a vital strategy to increase revenue and achieve a more balanced gender ratio on campus during a competitive period for higher education.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology's benefits and risks. Parents are advised to learn about AI alongside their children, co-creating rules for its ethical use and reinforcing the importance of fact-checking AI-generated information. While AI can be a powerful learning aid, studies show it can also provide unsafe responses regarding serious issues like self-harm. The guidance emphasizes balancing technological exploration with real-world activities and maintaining open communication to ensure safe and responsible usage.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled in favor of adult content creator Esperanza Gómez, stating that Meta violated her right to freedom of expression by deleting her popular Instagram account. The court determined that the company removed her account, which had over five million followers, without a clear justification and applied its content policies inconsistently. The ruling mandates that Meta must adjust its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions. This landmark decision reinforces that social media posts are protected under Colombia's constitution and sets a precedent for platform accountability in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, experts are divided on the outcome, highlighting a classic clash of styles and physical attributes. One perspective favors Crawford, citing his technical brilliance, adaptability, and reach advantage as key factors that could overcome the significant weight difference. Conversely, other analysts predict a victory for Álvarez, arguing that his size, power, and experience at the super-middleweight class will ultimately be too much for Crawford, who is moving up two divisions. The fight's intrigue lies in whether Crawford's pound-for-pound skill can negate Canelo's natural advantages in strength and weight.</p>

          <p>Following days of violent, youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has sworn in former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. Her appointment has helped restore calm to the capital, Kathmandu, where curfews have been eased and daily life is resuming. The "GenZ" protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader frustrations with the nation's economic problems. In a subsequent move, the country's parliament has been dissolved, and new elections have been scheduled for March 5, marking a significant political transition for the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at addressing both China's declining birth rate and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a subsidy for female researchers returning to work after having a child.

To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have given birth within the last two years. While the program's initial scope is limited, it is being viewed by some as a positive and significant step toward supporting women in STEM fields.</p>
