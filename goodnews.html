          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed that the energy price cap will fall in July, leading to a decrease of ¬£11 a month for typical gas and electricity bills. However, Ofgem is urging households to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate deals, which could potentially save up to ¬£200 annually. This price drop, the first in a year, reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices, but energy bills remain high. Citizens Advice has cautioned that the price cap reduction provides 'cold comfort' to those struggling with energy debt, advocating for targeted support and energy efficiency measures.</p>
