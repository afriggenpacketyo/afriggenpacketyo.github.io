          <p>Following their release from federal prison after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley are speaking out. Originally sentenced for bank and tax fraud, the couple discussed the harsh conditions they faced, including health issues, and their daughter Savannah's advocacy efforts that led to their freedom. While critics question the pardon, the Chrisleys defend it and express no remorse for their past lifestyle. They now plan to focus on prison reform and are set to return to television with a new show.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable feat of engineering, the city of Shanghai is using a fleet of 432 walking robots to move a 7,500-ton historic building complex. The three-building Huayanli complex, an example of classic shikumen architecture from the 1930s, is being carefully shifted to make way for a new underground commercial and transport hub. This innovative method was chosen due to the dense, historic nature of the area, where traditional relocation machinery would be impractical. The project showcases a blend of heritage preservation and modern urban development, allowing the city to expand its infrastructure while keeping its architectural history intact.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background in Duisburg, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Rising from an office assistant to the president of the Bundestag, Bas represents the party's left wing and is seen as a new source of hope for the ailing political group. She will lead alongside the more conservative Lars Klingbeil, who faced a rebuke from party delegates for the SPD's recent poor election results. In her new dual role as party co-chair and Germany's labor minister, Bas aims to champion social solidarity and reform.</p>

          <p>This article details the rigorous standards National Public Radio (NPR) employs when deciding to grant anonymity to sources in its reporting. The network's strong preference is for all sources to be on the record, but it makes exceptions when individuals face significant risks, such as job loss or legal jeopardy, for speaking out. Before granting anonymity, senior editors vet the source's credibility, the importance of their information, and the potential harm they face. If approved, NPR is transparent with its audience about why the source is unnamed, providing as much descriptive context as possible without revealing their identity.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, throwing very few punches through the early rounds. Despite being booed by the crowd, Paul showcased an improved jab and higher work rate, comfortably outpointing his 39-year-old opponent. The victory continues to fuel debate about the legitimacy of Paul's boxing career and the quality of his opponents, who are often past their prime.</p>

          <p>France is making a significant strategic investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state recently led a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment, becoming the company's largest shareholder in a push for the EU's technological sovereignty in space. However, industry experts are not convinced Eutelsat can effectively challenge its U.S. rival, citing major disparities in scale; Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's over 7,000. While the investment may bolster Eutelsat's position in specialized government and enterprise markets, achieving mass-market parity remains a distant goal. (not investment advice)</p>

The ambassador stated he received a direct invitation from Nagasaki's mayor and will attend to show respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of the importance of peace.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to advance a massive Republican tax and spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a tense, hours-long session. The procedural vote succeeded only after last-minute negotiations with a small group of conservative holdouts who had concerns about deficit reduction and Medicaid spending. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Mike Lee agreed to move the bill forward after receiving promises for a future vote on an amendment related to Medicaid. The advancement kicks off a lengthy legislative process, with final passage of the bill still uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
