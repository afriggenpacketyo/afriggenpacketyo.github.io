          <p>Following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, Syrian business owners are hopeful that the United States will lift economic sanctions, potentially paving the way for economic renewal. President Trump announced that the U.S. would end sanctions on Syria, which has been under restrictions since the 1970s. While some Western governments had already eased restrictions, the Trump administration had set conditions for their removal, including assurances regarding Iran's influence and the destruction of chemical weapons. Syrian business owners are drawing up plans to return and rebuild, though concerns remain about the process getting bogged down in U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>With rising interest rates and stricter lending requirements, many homeowners are finding it difficult to access their home equity. Experts suggest exploring alternative borrowing options like HELOCs and home equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap into their equity without refinancing their existing mortgage at a higher rate. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history can also help homeowners qualify for these borrowing products. Home equity has long been a powerful borrowing tool for homeowners and can be used for debt consolidation or home renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK economy has shown surprising resilience, with a growth rate of 0.7% in the first three months of this year, beating expectations and exceeding growth rates of other G7 advanced economies. While millions of families are still suffering from the cost of living squeeze, and small businesses face pressure, there is evidence of resilience beyond those sectors. Interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability may have played a significant role, with real incomes up and businesses accommodating rising costs through squeezed profit margins. This positive economic outlook contrasts with earlier predictions of a UK-specific economic crisis.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, partly due to the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed faces a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation, particularly as tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation. The Fed has been reluctant to ease policy after cutting its benchmark rate last year.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have discovered the DNA mystery that gives ginger cats their distinctive coloring. They found that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code in the ARHGAP36 gene, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye, and fur tone produce lighter colors. The research, crowdfunded by cat lovers, also helps explain why ginger cats are more likely to be male and could shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.</p>

Frimpong's release clause is understood to be around 35 million euros (¬£29.5m), which Liverpool is expected to meet.
