          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to lower import taxes on goods traded between the two countries, signaling a major de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. The deal involves canceling some tariffs altogether and suspending others for 90 days, with the goal of continued talks to deepen cooperation. The US will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will lower tariffs on some US imports and halt non-tariff countermeasures. This truce is expected to lead to a rebound in shipping and improve relations between the two economic powerhouses. (not investment advice)</p>

His release is viewed as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict resolution talks.

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs, signaling a step to defuse the trade war threatening the world‚Äôs two largest economies. The U.S. will reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent. The agreement breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and the United States to a halt. Many American businesses had suspended orders, holding out hope that the two countries could strike a deal to lower the tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>
