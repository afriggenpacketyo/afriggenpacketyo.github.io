          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Pollution in Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, addressing public outrage over pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and promised tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. The plan also includes a UK-wide ban on wet wipes containing plastic but stops short of nationalizing the industry, a move deemed too costly. This commitment comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, as pollution incidents and executive bonuses have risen.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Defence stated the drill's theme is "joint border patrol training" and aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This move toward closer defense ties occurs during the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The increased cooperation comes as both nations navigate economic pressures, including the ongoing US tariff war, strengthening their partnership.</p>

          <h2>Italian Bear That Fatally Attacked Jogger is Relocated to German Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order for the bear to be euthanized. The incident sparked a debate on human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has grown significantly. The bear, which arrived safely, will now live in a secure, one-hectare enclosure, marking a resolution to the contentious case.</p>

          <p>A fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterosaur, discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this group of flying reptiles. The fossil revealed phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants, and small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to help grind tough food. This rare find confirms that this particular species was herbivorous, challenging previous assumptions about their diets. The discovery sheds new light on the ecological roles of pterosaurs, the creatures that dominated the skies during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the earliest stages of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,370 light-years away. Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's surrounding disk. These are the fundamental building blocks believed to have formed Earth and other terrestrial planets. This landmark discovery provides an unprecedented look into a process that may mirror the dawn of our own solar system and could help determine how common Earth-like worlds are.</p>

          <p>South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to counter a growing trade deficit and mitigate the impact of a potential 30% US tariff. A high-level delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify South Africa's export portfolio from raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy tech. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to address market access barriers and create a more balanced trade relationship with China, which has become a crucial alternative market.

          <p>In a notable Wisconsin murder case, data from a Fitbit device played a crucial role in exonerating a man initially suspected of killing his girlfriend. After Nicole Vander Heyden was found murdered in 2016, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, became the prime suspect. However, his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly asleep during the time of the murder. This technological alibi, along with other digital evidence from the actual killer's phone, shifted the investigation. Ultimately, another man, George Steven Burch, was identified through DNA and convicted of the crime, highlighting technology's growing role in justice.</p>
