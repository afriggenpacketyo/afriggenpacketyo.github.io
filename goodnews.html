          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a second consecutive month of growth in April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% growth in March. High-tech manufacturing and household appliance sectors saw notable improvements, supported by government subsidies and consumer trade-in schemes. However, the automobile and apparel sectors faced challenges due to price competition and shifting demand. Weining Yu from the NBS cautioned that constraints such as insufficient demand and external uncertainty persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has decided to allocate 388.1 billion yen ($2.7 billion) from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer. This measure is part of a larger relief package aimed at countering the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills by 1,040 yen in July and September, and by 1,260 yen in August.
