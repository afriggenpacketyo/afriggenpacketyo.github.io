          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are co-chairing a Franco-German Ministerial Council, the first since Germany's recent change in government. The meeting, involving ten ministers from each nation, focuses on aligning economic and security policies, with both leaders emphasizing their partnership as central to Europe's future. The council convenes as EU defense and foreign ministers meet separately to discuss bolstering military aid for Ukraine following intense Russian airstrikes. These diplomatic efforts highlight a push for greater European coordination on key issues, including new sanctions against Russia and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

In the United States, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, is also due for release. This comes after recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell increased expectations for an interest rate cut in September. Despite a largely negative week influenced by French political issues and questions over Fed independence, the regional Stoxx 600 index is on track for its second consecutive monthly gain.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed and successfully tested a new vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the "Gimbal" unidentified aerial phenomenon filmed by US Navy pilots in 2015. The experimental aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design with an elliptical, ring-like wing integrated with a central wing section, which could enhance flight endurance and stability. Unlike conventional drones, its four rotors are mounted at the junctions of the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers. This innovative design represents a potential leap forward in uncrewed flight technology, moving a mysterious shape from speculation into reality.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. Until now, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children. The announcement coincides with data showing that uptake for other main childhood vaccines has fallen below the 95% target.</p>

          <p>In his podcast, former England captain Wayne Rooney shared an anecdote about his 2004 transfer from Everton to Manchester United. He recounted receiving a surprise phone call from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes while watching television as a teenager, who directly asked him if he was going to sign for the club. Rooney revealed that manager Sir Alex Ferguson had wanted to wait another year to sign him, but Manchester United moved quickly to prevent him from joining rival club Newcastle. The transfer happened so fast that Rooney ended up wearing his wife's cousin's jumper when he officially signed.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking his first visit to China in seven years and signaling a potential improvement in relations. The meeting comes as both nations face economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, possibly pushing the regional rivals toward reluctant cooperation. Despite deep-seated suspicion stemming from border disputes and China's close ties with Pakistan, economic necessity may be fostering common ground. India remains heavily reliant on China for key industrial components, while Chinese companies see India's large market as a vital opportunity amid slowing domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is planning the first test launch of its new Soyuz-5 rocket for December. The medium-class launch vehicle, seen as a Russian-made successor to the Ukrainian Zenit-2 rocket, has been in development for a decade. The launch is a significant goal for Roscosmos, which has faced funding shortages and severed ties with the European Space Agency following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The agency has since shifted its focus, planning to launch the Soyuz-5 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which it leases for $115 million annually until 2050.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff advanced to the third round of the US Open after a difficult 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory over Donna Vekić, a match marked by her struggles with a newly remodeled serve. Gauff committed seven double faults in the first set and was seen crying into a towel during a changeover after being broken. However, she managed to reset emotionally, winning a tight tiebreak before finding her composure in the second set. Gauff is working with a new biomechanics coach to remake her serve, a challenging process to undertake during a major tournament, but one she believes is a necessary step for her future.</p>

Her company specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a material crucial for efficiency in power electronics used in advanced AI data centers. In a significant development, U.S. chip giant Nvidia recently named Innoscience as a supplier for its next-generation power architecture, a notable inclusion amid U.S.-China tech decoupling. Within six years, Luo's company achieved the world's first mass production of 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, placing China at the forefront of this third-generation semiconductor technology.</p>
