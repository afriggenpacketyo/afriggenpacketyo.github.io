          <p>Scientists have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth, originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. Researchers propose two possible origins for these phenomena: either supermassive black holes ejecting particles or high-speed cosmic particle collisions. This finding suggests that energetic processes have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe.</p>

          <p>Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani showcased his pitching prowess in his third start of the season, throwing two sharp innings against the Kansas City Royals. He recorded the hardest pitch of his career at 101.7 mph and effectively mixed his pitches, allowing no runs. Despite his strong performance, the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5 after the bullpen struggled.

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly advancing in AI algorithm development, closing the gap with the United States. While the U.S. maintains a significant lead in semiconductor chip technology, a gap Shum believes will take years to bridge, China is making strategic breakthroughs in algorithms. He highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved competitive results with far less computing power than its American counterparts. This suggests China is effectively compensating for its hardware limitations through software and engineering innovation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The plaintiffs sued Trump for defamatory statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he falsely claimed they had killed someone and pled guilty. The men were wrongfully convicted and spent years in prison before being exonerated.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their ancestral homes. The findings, which also show more grave goods were offered to females, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal social structures in ancient societies.</p>

The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades designed to improve front-end feel, an issue that had been hampering his confidence.
