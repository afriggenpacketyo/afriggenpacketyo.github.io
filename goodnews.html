          <h2>Trump Considers Tariff Revenue Rebate Checks for Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:30:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he is considering issuing rebate checks to Americans, funded by the substantial tariff revenue collected by his administration. He noted the potential for rebates for "people of a certain income level," without specifying a threshold, while also emphasizing his administration's priority to pay down the national debt. The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue this year, projected to increase to $300 billion annually, yet economists forecast a significant rise in the national deficit due to recent tax cuts and spending. This proposal, reminiscent of pandemic-era checks, would require new tax legislation from Congress, as tariffs are typically paid by U.S. importers and could be impacting consumer prices.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) due to record tappable equity and relatively low interest rates compared to other borrowing options. While HELOCs typically take two to six weeks to close, the article explores whether a quicker turnaround, under two weeks, is feasible. Achieving a faster closing depends on the lender's streamlined processes, the borrower's preparedness with documents, and the possibility of appraisal waivers. However, federal regulations, like the mandatory three-day rescission period, make same-week closings nearly impossible, emphasizing the importance of proactive planning for borrowers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Britbox series titled 'Outrageous' dramatizes the lives of the six British Mitford sisters, a prominent and often controversial aristocratic family known for their diverse and often conflicting political and social paths. The article highlights an archival interview with Jessica Mitford from 1989, where she discussed her involvement with the Communist Party and her book on the death industry. This historical context underscores the complexity of their lives, from fascism to communism, making their story ripe for dramatic adaptation. The series promises to offer a fresh look at their intricate relationships, public personas, and the societal impact of their choices, drawing viewers into their unique historical narrative.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina woman, Kelsey Pittman, has been found alive in Colorado more than eight months after her disappearance, during which her car was discovered abandoned near Death Valley National Park. Pittman, 33, was last seen in St. George, Utah, in December 2024, prompting an extensive missing person investigation by the Inyo County Sheriff's Office and various agencies. Despite months of coordinated searches involving drones and cadaver dogs, no further physical evidence was found near her vehicle. Officials did not disclose details about Pittman's condition or the circumstances of her being found, citing privacy for her and her family.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's exceptional 150-run innings propelled him to second on the all-time Test run-scorers' list, giving England a commanding lead over India on day three of the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Root's 38th Test century saw him surpass cricketing legends Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, and Ricky Ponting. His partnerships, including a 144-run stand with Ollie Pope and 142 with Ben Stokes, effectively ground down a beleaguered Indian side. England now holds a 186-run lead with two days remaining, positioning them strongly for a victory that would secure an unassailable 3-1 series lead.</p>

          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman remains uncertain if key striker Lauren James will be fit for Sunday's Euro 2025 final against Spain, following an ankle injury sustained during the semi-final. James, 23, who has scored two goals in the tournament, was substituted at half-time and later seen applying ice to her ankle. Wiegman expressed hope for her availability, stating they would give her time to recover. The potential absence of James sparks debate over her replacement, as other players like Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang have made significant impacts from the bench, giving the manager "headaches" but also strong options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI is facing tension as OpenAI seeks greater independence, aiming to renegotiate its contract and convert to a more traditional corporate structure. This push challenges Microsoft's significant $14 billion investment and its favorable current agreement, which includes intellectual property rights and a share of OpenAI's revenue. A key point of contention is a clause that could void Microsoft's access to OpenAI's technology if artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved. While Microsoft benefits greatly from OpenAI's success, OpenAI's ambition and infrastructure needs are driving it to diversify cloud providers and develop products that directly compete with Microsoft's offerings.

          <p>Bridget Everett, star, writer, and producer of HBO's "Somebody Somewhere," reflects on her semi-autobiographical journey from waitressing and karaoke in New York to becoming a local legend in her Kansas hometown, where the show is set. The series follows Sam Miller, a character grappling with grief and self-discovery after her sister's death. Everett's unique cabaret performances, which blend risqué humor with meditations on life and loss, including the death of her beloved dog, inspired the show's focus on strength and vulnerability.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress, aiming to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file employees. The proposed legislation would offer a 3 percentage point corporate tax rate discount to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of employees. Sponsors argue this initiative could transfer nearly $4 trillion in stock value to almost 40 million middle-class Americans, fostering employee loyalty and expanding ownership. The bill also includes tax deductions for companies and tax-free benefits for employees, highlighting a bipartisan effort to address wealth disparity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A balance transfer credit card offers a temporary 0% APR period, allowing consumers to pay down high-interest debt without accruing additional interest. However, the article warns of significant financial consequences if the transferred balance is not paid in full before this promotional period expires. Immediately, the card's standard APR, often high, kicks in, applying interest to the remaining balance. Some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the original transfer date. Failure to pay off the balance can also negatively impact credit scores due to high utilization. The article advises creating a strict payoff plan, cutting expenses, avoiding new purchases, and considering debt relief options if needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the influence of the Greek island of Corfu on John le Carré's masterpiece, "A Perfect Spy," despite the island only featuring briefly in the novel. Author Honor Jones investigates how a place can serve as a catalyst for writers, even if not a primary setting. Le Carré himself had a significant encounter in Corfu, learning more about his con artist father from a former associate, which directly informed a central theme of the novel about a monstrous, charismatic narcissist. Corfu's history of invasions and tourism also lends broader thematic significance, reflecting on influence and identity coalescing into a whole.</p>
