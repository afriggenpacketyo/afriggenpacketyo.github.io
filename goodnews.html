          <p>The BBC is launching "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," a new dating reality show hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of "Love Island," "Married at First Sight," and "Survivor." Couples, matched by experts after a brief speed date, are married and then stranded on a remote tropical island, living in beach huts with minimal amenities. Contestants describe the experience as "hell" due to mosquitoes, heat, and lack of personal care products, but praise the show's authenticity and focus on building genuine connections under adversity. This article explores the show's concept as a less superficial alternative to traditional dating programs, appealing to slightly older contestants seeking deeper relationships.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest threatening the country's forests. This beetle, which has destroyed millions of spruce trees across Europe, was discovered in the UK in 2018, having arrived via wind rather than imported wood. The team uses drones for aerial surveys and sniffer dogs to detect pheromones and "frass" from beetle colonies, successfully eradicating the pest from at-risk areas in southeast England. However, climate change, leading to stressed trees and larger beetle populations in Europe, poses an increasing risk for future incursions.</p>
