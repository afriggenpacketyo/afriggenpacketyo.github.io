          <p>Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe is currently hospitalized with gastroenteritis, causing him to miss the Club World Cup opener against Al-Hilal. The club initially reported his absence due to illness, but further tests revealed the acute gastroenteritis diagnosis. Gastroenteritis is an infection of the digestive system that leads to symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, requiring Mbappe to undergo tests and treatment in the hospital.

          <p>Communities across the United States are celebrating Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery. Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, marks the date in 1865 when the last enslaved people in Texas were officially freed. Celebrations include parades, art shows, educational workshops, and community gatherings. Juneteenth became a U.S. holiday in 2021, and public festivities have grown significantly since then, honoring the origins, evolution, and significance of the holiday.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, officially recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. The name combines "June" and "nineteenth," marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. While the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, it wasn't until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, that the news reached the westernmost Confederate state. Celebrations vary across the U.S. and include parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, with many viewing the holiday as a joyful anniversary of independence.</p>

          <p>Savings experts weigh in on whether high-yield savings accounts are worth it in today's economy, noting they offer an opportunity to earn more interest than traditional savings accounts. Despite recent interest rate drops, high-yield savings accounts still provide competitive returns, especially for short-term financial goals and emergency funds. However, they are not a substitute for long-term investing, and consumers should consider alternatives like CDs. Experts recommend comparing rates and understanding the terms before opening an account, viewing it as part of an overall financial strategy rather than the entirety of it (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter due to changes in the Warm Home Discount eligibility criteria. The government is scrapping the property size and energy score requirements, extending the discount to 2.7 million more homes, including nearly a million households with children. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue that it still leaves out those on non-means tested benefits. The expansion is funded by energy companies, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills, though the government aims to offset this with savings from reduced expenditure and improved debt management (not investment advice).</p>
