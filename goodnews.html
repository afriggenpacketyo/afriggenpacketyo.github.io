          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump stated his continued commitment to brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, though he conceded that the parties are "not ready yet." In an interview, he expressed optimism that a deal would eventually be reached but acknowledged the process has been more difficult than other conflicts he has mediated. His comments come as allies meet in Paris to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, with uncertainty remaining over the prospects of direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.</p>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public's view of the U.S.-China relationship is more complex than often perceived. While optimistic about their own country's future, a plurality of respondents (48%) expressed a preference for a "shared leadership role" with the U.S. rather than outright global dominance. This suggests an acceptance of peaceful coexistence, although experts note that some self-censorship may have influenced the results of the survey.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to revoke approximately $2 billion in research grants to Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration had frozen the funding in April, accusing the institution of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies. While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, she concluded the government's true aim was a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on the university. The White House has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>
