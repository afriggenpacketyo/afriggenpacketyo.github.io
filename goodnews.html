        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive to relocate all stray dogs in Delhi to shelters, following widespread protests from animal welfare groups. The new ruling mandates that non-aggressive strays should be vaccinated and sterilized before being released to their original locations, while dogs with rabies or aggressive behavior will be immunized and housed in shelters. The court also prohibited feeding stray dogs in public spaces, requiring dedicated areas instead, and plans to formulate a national policy on stray dogs after hearing similar cases. Animal welfare groups have welcomed this "balanced, structured and compassionate" decision, though some seek clearer criteria for identifying "aggressive dogs."</p>

          <p>The opening of Washington state's first In-N-Out Burger in Ridgefield generated immense excitement, drawing hundreds of customers who waited overnight and for hours. The popular burger chain opened two hours early to accommodate the long lines, with one customer driving 126 miles to be the first in the drive-thru. This expansion marks a significant moment for the company, which now has over 400 locations across eight states. Despite CEO Lynsi Snyder's recent comments about leaving California, which sparked backlash and political debate, the company emphasizes its continued growth and popularity, underscoring its significant cultural and economic footprint.</p>

          <p>Wilson’s phalaropes, small birds that migrate 6,000 miles between Mono Lake in California and Laguna Mar Chiquita in Argentina, have fostered a unique partnership between the two communities. This remarkable journey has inspired biologists, educators, and students, leading to exchange programs, shared art, and a phalarope festival. Despite their inspiring role, the phalarope population is declining, and their saline lake habitats are increasingly threatened by water use and climate change. Conservationists are working to protect these critical stopovers, highlighting the birds as "polar bears of salt lakes" and symbols of interconnected ecosystems.</p>

It tells the story of Cob County, whose livelihood depends on corn, and a young woman's quest to save it. The cast receives acclaim for their vocal performances and charismatic portrayals, contributing to a show that offers delightful and wholesome entertainment, despite some minor criticisms regarding length and the homogenization of the touring cast.</p>

          <h2>Book Review: ‘The Martians’ Explores Humanity’s Fascination with Life on Mars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Baron's "The Martians" delves into the early 20th-century belief in intelligent life on Mars, exploring how scientists, journalists, and the public projected fantasies onto the red planet. The book highlights figures like Percival Lowell, who invested heavily in proving Martian life, and the impact of scientific theories, tabloid journalism, and early science fiction. Baron examines the human desire to believe and the occasional deviation from scientific method, such as Lowell's tendency to bend facts. Ultimately, the article suggests that while many conclusions about Mars were flawed, this historical fascination ignited generations to consider space exploration as a real possibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>R.F. Kuang's new dark academia fantasy, "Katabasis," takes readers on a journey into hell, offering a fresh perspective despite the common literary trope. The article follows protagonist Alice Law, a psychologically wounded student, as she ventures into the underworld to retrieve her mentor's soul, driven by a flawed, greedy motive. The novel is praised for Kuang's intellectual depth, intricate world-building, and a more mature, wryly humorous tone compared to her earlier works. While rich in literary references, the story also critiques the self-destructive academic environment and explores themes of delusion and sacrifice, making it an intriguing addition to the genre.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles labor groups are advocating for a "New Deal" to ensure the city and the LA28 Olympics organizing committee commit to improving conditions for working people. They call for multibillion-dollar investments in housing, a ban on short-term rentals like Airbnb, and protections for immigrant workers. Unions argue that past mega-events have often displaced low-income residents and left host cities indebted. While Olympic organizers promise economic opportunities, labor leaders emphasize the need for tangible benefits to address L.A.'s housing crisis and ensure a lasting positive legacy for the city's workforce.</p>

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases as the delayed impact of soaring cocoa prices hits retailers, according to market analysts. Cocoa futures have reached record highs due to adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa, the primary global supplier. While cocoa prices have eased slightly this year, manufacturers are still processing higher costs from late 2024, passing them onto consumers. Experts predict prices will remain elevated but may show some relief by the 2026 Easter season as industrial demand softens and supply improves. Other factors like tariffs and minimum wage hikes could also influence costs. (not investment advice)</p>
