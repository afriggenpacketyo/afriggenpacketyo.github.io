          <p>During a recent episode of Michelle Obama's podcast, she and former President Barack Obama humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Joined by her brother, they joked about the speculation that arises whenever they are not seen in public together. Michelle Obama reaffirmed their strong bond, stating there has never been a moment she considered leaving him. This appearance follows her previous comments explaining that her occasional absence from public events was a personal choice for her well-being, not a sign of marital strife.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that two-thirds of American families have already started their back-to-school shopping, a significant increase from last year. This early start is driven by widespread concern over economic uncertainty, particularly the potential impact of new tariffs on imported goods like clothing and electronics, which could drive prices even higher. In response to this consumer anxiety, major retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart are launching their back-to-school sales earlier than usual to attract budget-conscious shoppers looking to lock in prices before potential increases take effect.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with net income rising 15% to $3.54 billion. The strong results were fueled by a 12% increase in revenue, reaching $16.79 billion, largely due to higher client activity in equity trading and robust performance in its wealth management division. The bank's institutional securities and wealth management segments both delivered significant revenue growth compared to the same period last year, marking a consistently strong performance for the financial giant.

          <p>A new study indicates that consuming foods high in choline, an essential nutrient, may help lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that a daily intake of about 350 milligrams of choline was associated with the lowest risk of clinical Alzheimer's diagnoses in older adults. Choline is commonly found in foods such as poultry, eggs, dairy products, beans, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli. Health experts emphasize the critical role of nutrition in brain health, also recommending other brain-boosting foods like walnuts, salmon, and blueberries.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a €2 trillion, seven-year budget proposal that includes a fivefold increase in funding for defense and space, amounting to €131 billion. This significant boost in defense investment reflects growing geopolitical concerns and what the Commission president has called Europe's "era of rearmament." The budget also allocates substantial funds for climate and biodiversity projects, support for Ukraine, and migration management. The proposal must now gain unanimous approval from all EU member states, some of whom have already expressed concerns about its size.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times review examines two productions at the Theatricum Botanicum, which ambitiously reset classic European plays in American settings. Ellen Geer's adaptation of Chekhov's "The Seagull" relocates the story to 1970s Malibu, capturing the groovy, self-absorbed "Me Generation" with infectious energy, though the final act is noted as a disappointment. John Galsworthy's 1909 labor drama "Strife" is transferred to 1890s Pennsylvania, offering a resonant look at a capital-labor deadlock, though the acting is sometimes overly broad. The review praises the company's vision in reviving the seldom-seen Galsworthy play.</p>

The seizure, the largest in the history of Yemen's National Resistance Forces, included over 750 tons of munitions, such as hundreds of advanced cruise, anti-ship, and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as drone engines and radar systems. CENTCOM stated the interdiction demonstrates that Iran remains a primary destabilizing force in the region and praised the effort to limit the flow of arms to the Houthis.</p>
