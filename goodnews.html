          <p>U.S. rare earth and critical mineral mining stocks experienced a significant surge following China's decision to tighten export restrictions on these vital materials. Beijing's new rules, requiring licenses for foreign entities exporting rare earths or utilizing Chinese technology, are seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This move has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will increase investment in developing a domestic supply chain, bolstering U.S. industry against China's dominance. The situation highlights ongoing trade tensions and the strategic importance of rare earths for national security and various advanced technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reported better-than-expected earnings and a strong outlook, driven by rising airfares and robust demand for luxury travel. The airline's third-quarter profit increased 11%, with premium travel revenue significantly outpacing main cabin sales. CEO Ed Bastian noted an improvement in cash sales since July, indicating a recovery in demand after earlier consumer confidence issues. Delta anticipates continued growth and margin expansion into 2026, positioning itself well despite broader economic concerns and the ongoing government shutdown, which has not yet impacted its operations.

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, has been granted a stay of execution just one week before it was scheduled. His defense team argues he is innocent, claiming his daughter's death was misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome and was instead due to severe pneumonia. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered a review of his case under the state's "junk science" law, which allows for relief if evidence is no longer credible. This development follows similar exonerations and ongoing legal efforts to secure Roberson a new trial.</p>

This initiative builds on California's prior efforts in school nutrition, including free meals for all students and banning synthetic food dyes.
