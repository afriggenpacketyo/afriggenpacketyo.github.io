          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won Romania's presidential election, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion after months of political turbulence. Simion, leader of the far-right AUR party, initially won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled previous election due to Russian interference claims. Dan secured victory with 55% of the vote, emphasizing unity and profound change in Romania. Romanians are broadly discontent with mainstream parties, intensifying political instability after the government's collapse due to its candidate's failure in the first round.</p>

Despite a brief challenge from Jon Rahm, Scheffler's consistency and ability to steady the ship under pressure led to a comfortable victory. The win earned him $3.4 million and further solidified his position as the world's top-ranked golfer. Other players, like Bryson DeChambeau and Harris English, had notable performances but ultimately couldn't match Scheffler's dominance.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor of Bucharest, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Simion had been seen as the front-runner, but Dan's victory is likely to ease concerns in Europe about Romania joining Hungary and Slovakia in opposing aid to Ukraine. Simion claimed the election was rigged and called for protests. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO.</p>
