        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demonstrators in Barcelona and Mallorca used water pistols on tourists to protest the negative impacts of mass tourism, including rising housing costs and the loss of local character. Protesters argue that the influx of tourists is pushing residents out and replacing traditional businesses with tourist-oriented establishments. Activists in other European cities like Venice and Lisbon joined the coordinated effort, calling for a reevaluation of the economic model driving overtourism. While some tourists laughed off the water squirtings, the protests highlight growing discontent with the industry's impact on local communities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani will make his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery following that season, keeping him off the mound until now.

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged after it received a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The takeover bid, led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG, follows two previous proposals from the same consortium. The consortium, which includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and Carlyle Group, has offered a cash price of $5.76 per Santos share, a premium from its previous closing price. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and shut down harmful servers, obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027, aiming for online safety on par with the United States. The country has come under cyber threats mainly from China, North Korea, and Russia, along with criminal groups, with authorities working to increase the number of trained cybersecurity workers.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest rate since late 2023, boosted by government subsidies and online shopping events. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, exceeding analysts' estimates, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment expanded 3.7% year-to-date, but property investment continued to contract. Improving consumption is a welcome respite for China's economy, which has been struggling with persistent deflation, although falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.
