          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant jump after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's stock since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of shares. This substantial insider buy was interpreted by the market as a strong signal of confidence from Musk in the electric vehicle maker's future. The move comes as the company navigates challenges including slumping sales and concerns that Musk's political activities have negatively impacted the brand's image. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new action plan to nearly double its energy storage capacity by 2027, supported by an estimated $35 billion investment. The goal is to exceed 180 gigawatts, primarily through advanced lithium-ion batteries, to support the nation's rapidly expanding renewable energy infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the development of alternative technologies such as hydrogen and compressed-air storage. This move solidifies China's position as a global leader in the sector, responding to surging domestic and international demand for energy storage solutions.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, provides unconditional cash payments of $1,500 to expectant mothers and $500 per month for their baby's first year. Recent studies have demonstrated the program's success, showing significant reductions in maternal postpartum depression, increased housing stability, and improved infant health outcomes. As the first community-wide cash transfer program of its kind in the U.S., its positive results are offering a powerful new model for alleviating child poverty and supporting families.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched one of the world's most ambitious conservation projects, aiming to eradicate invasive predators like possums and rats by 2050 to save its native bird species. A crucial part of this nationwide effort involves mobilizing community volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set and monitor traps in local parks and their own backyards. This grassroots approach is considered essential for removing predators from both public and private lands, representing a significant social as well as biological challenge to protect the country's unique wildlife.</p>

          <p>British prosecutors have dropped all charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a trial, leading to not guilty verdicts. One of the accused men described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare" and expressed relief that justice was served. The case had previously been denounced by Beijing as "malicious slander."</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the U.K., the two nations are set to sign a series of major deals to initiate a "golden age" of nuclear power. The agreements include plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in northeast England and to develop data centers powered by this new nuclear technology. This cross-Atlantic partnership is expected to generate thousands of jobs, accelerate nuclear development, and secure billions in private investment. The initiative underscores both countries' commitment to nuclear energy to meet rising power demands, particularly from the AI sector.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies after ruling that it violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta acted arbitrarily, applied its nudity and sexual services rules inconsistently, and failed to provide a clear justification for the closure, which affected her ability to work. The ruling requires Meta to create more transparent mechanisms for users to challenge content moderation decisions, setting a significant precedent for social media platforms in the region.</p>

          <p>A yellow weather warning for strong winds is in effect across the southern half of the U.K., causing some travel disruptions with gusts reaching up to 78mph in exposed areas. However, the Met Office has clarified that this weather system is not a named storm, contrary to some reports. A storm is typically named only when its impacts are forecast to be severe enough to warrant an amber or red warning. This system does not meet that threshold, so the first named storm of the season, Amy, has yet to arrive.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, aiming to prohibit employers from using credit checks when making hiring decisions. Proponents of the bill argue that the practice is an unfair barrier to employment that disproportionately discriminates against minorities, women, and individuals with medical debt. They also contend that a person's credit history is not a reliable predictor of their job performance, making the practice both ineffective and unjust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has expressed a counterintuitive view on the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, suggesting the event could be a "net negative" for the airline industry. He explained that while the Olympics attract a surge in leisure travelers, they simultaneously cause a significant shutdown in lucrative business travel to the host city. This drop in corporate bookings often outweighs the gains from tourism, potentially leading to an overall decrease in revenue for airlines during the period of the games.</p>

          <p>Anniversary screenings of classic films like "Jaws" and "The Sound of Music" are becoming a significant box office draw, often outperforming new releases on their opening weekends. This trend is providing a welcome boost to movie theaters, which have struggled to recover since the pandemic, by filling seats during typically slower midweek periods. The success of these re-releases suggests a strong audience appetite for nostalgia and the communal experience of watching beloved movies on the big screen, harkening back to an era when cinema was more central to popular culture.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Renters Face Years of Heat Before New Cooling Mandate Takes Effect</h2>

          <p>A new Los Angeles County ordinance will require landlords to provide cooling in all rental units, but the deadline is not until 2032 for many buildings. In the meantime, this article outlines strategies for renters to cope with increasingly dangerous heat waves. Research suggests that passive measures like improved insulation and the practice of "zone cooling"—chilling only one room—can effectively maintain safe indoor temperatures. These low-cost tactics can also help reduce strain on the power grid and lower energy bills for tenants.</p>
