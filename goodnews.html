          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. The study examined fossils, including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, and found genetic exchanges between North American and Eurasian populations. These migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. The article highlights the findings of the research published in the journal Science.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Effort to Limit Birthright Citizenship Faces Supreme Court Scrutiny</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court justices have questioned Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship, in a trio of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases stem from the president‚Äôs January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren‚Äôt citizens or permanent residents. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to ‚Äúall persons born or naturalized in the United States‚Äù.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have signed an agreement for the UAE to build the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the United States. This deal would give UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips. The US and UAE did not say which AI chips could be included in the data centers, but sources told Reuters the UAE could be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs most advanced AI chips per year starting in 2025. The agreement reflects the Trump administration‚Äôs confidence that the chips can be managed securely, in part by requiring data centers be managed by US companies.</p>
