          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently revealed that a co-star on the 1990s hit show "Melrose Place" refused to speak to her during filming. In a podcast appearance, Davis described the set as competitive and recalled that while she was friends with co-star Marcia Cross, another unnamed actress would not even respond to a "good morning." Davis, who played the villainous Brooke Armstrong for one season, said the experience was intimidating but also felt like she had "won the lottery" as a young actor. She noted this experience later inspired her to be a "welcoming committee" for guest stars on "Sex and the City."</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a small, idealistic project into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted the platform's growth has surpassed expectations, with major corporations now building on its infrastructure. Industry leaders like EY's Paul Brody describe Ethereum as becoming the "plumbing" of Wall Street, integrating with traditional financial systems to handle trillions in payments and tokenized assets. Despite its success, Buterin warns of the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption continues to accelerate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that places restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that basing stops on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish is unconstitutional. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that targeted workplaces and led to protests. While the administration argued agents rely on intelligence, the court found the factors used described only a broad profile, violating the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party in the UK, but it currently lacks a name. Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help choose a title that encapsulates the party's platform. The process is more than just branding, as the party cannot field election candidates until a name is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. This unconventional, supporter-led approach aims to build a grassroots identity from the ground up.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers' decision to sign Luka Dončić to a major contract extension officially positions him as the new face of the franchise. This strategic move, however, intensifies questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article suggests an uneasy dynamic, as James is accustomed to being the focal point of any team he plays for. While Lakers management has expressed positive dialogue with James's camp, their comments also indicate a respect for his autonomy in deciding his future, leaving his long-term status with the team uncertain.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has stated that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for him to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking tragic news to patients. Witnessing his stepfather die before he could enjoy retirement made Hill realize he did not want the same fate and gave him the freedom to pursue his passion. He described leaving the hospital for the last time as a "weight lifted" and an exciting, if terrifying, new beginning.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a prominent advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's current embrace of open-source AI, which is fueling a highly competitive and rapidly advancing ecosystem. AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's "Darwinian" open-source environment, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI releasing powerful new models, could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field. Meta's change in course reflects the evolving strategic landscape of global AI development.</p>

Her case drew attention to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement priorities, which have seen a significant increase in arrests, even for individuals with strong family and military ties in the U.S.</p>

The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season. The sale price far exceeds previous WNBA franchise transactions and signals the league's rapid growth and increasing investment value. The Connecticut Sun, one of the league's original franchises, has been owned by the Mohegan Tribe since 2003 and was the first WNBA team to be run by a non-NBA owner.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The animal, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favor during World War II. For decades, it was rumored that the platypus died from shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, researchers examining archival records, including the attendant's logbook, have concluded that the creature most likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, as water and air temperatures far exceeded what the species can tolerate.</p>
