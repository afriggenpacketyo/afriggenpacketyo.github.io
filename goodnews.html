          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:07:43 EDT</div>

          <p>A Wisconsin mother, Nicole Vander Heyden, was murdered in 2016, initially leading investigators to suspect her boyfriend, Doug Detrie. However, data from Detrie's Fitbit device corroborated his alibi, providing crucial evidence that exonerated him from the crime. The investigation then pivoted, utilizing DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and track the real killer, George Burch. This case highlights how modern consumer technology, often overlooked by users, can play a decisive role in both convicting the guilty and clearing the innocent in complex criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced a substantial reduction in the number of people considered missing following devastating floods earlier in July. Through extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, the count of unaccounted-for individuals has dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three. The powerful floods resulted in over 130 fatalities across Texas, with 107 of those deaths occurring in Kerr County alone. Authorities expressed gratitude for the tireless efforts of over a thousand responders who helped verify the safety of many who were initially reported missing.</p>

          <p>British pop star Charli XCX has married George Daniel, the drummer for the popular band The 1975, in a ceremony at Hackney Town Hall in London. Speculation began after a passerby's video showed the couple posing for photos, which the singer later confirmed through social media posts. Charli XCX, whose recent album 'Brat' has become a global cultural phenomenon, has been in a public relationship with Daniel for several years, announcing their engagement in 2023. The two have also collaborated professionally on music, including on her critically acclaimed 'Brat' album, where Daniel is credited as a co-producer and co-writer.</p>

          <p>England's national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a one-off Test match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts as the team made numerous changes from their previous game.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new criminal offense designed to target individuals who are preparing for mass casualty attacks but lack a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by incidents like the Southport attack, where existing terrorism laws could not be applied to pre-crime plotting. This new power would allow police to intervene and apprehend suspects for preparatory actions, such as researching a target, mirroring the powers currently used against terror suspects. The goal is to treat the planning of such violent acts as seriously as terrorism, regardless of the motivation.</p>

After the song, she made a lighthearted comment about the incident, demonstrating professionalism in handling the unexpected mid-air malfunction during her "The Lifetimes Tour."</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has expressed a desire to shift public savings from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments to boost the economy. The government plans to launch a new advertising campaign and may require banks to notify customers with large cash savings about investment opportunities. While the immediate plan to cut the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs has been paused, the debate continues on how to make investing more appealing, particularly to women who are currently less likely to invest. Experts caution that pushing inexperienced savers into potentially volatile markets could backfire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, exclusive members-only clubs is gaining popularity among India's newly wealthy, offering an alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas. Chains like Soho House are expanding in India, catering to a generation of young entrepreneurs, creators, and tech moguls who may not fit into the old-money establishments. These new clubs emphasize a more relaxed, contemporary atmosphere and a diverse community built on personal accomplishment rather than family legacy. While still luxurious and expensive, their rise reflects the significant economic and demographic shifts occurring in a country with a booming class of self-made elites.</p>

          <p>A widely circulated image claiming to show former President Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a young girl has been confirmed to be a fake, created using artificial intelligence.

These include deformed hands on the girl, a distorted jacket sleeve on Trump, and malformed faces of people in the background. While some authentic photos of Trump and Epstein together do exist, this specific, viral image has been definitively debunked by fact-checkers as a digital fabrication.</p>

If signed, the 40-year-old Paul would likely accept a reserve role as the team continues to build a roster capable of competing in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>

The plan also includes a ban on wet wipes containing plastic and aims to cut phosphorus pollution.

He quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole, met with enormous roars from the home crowd.
