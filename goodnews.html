          <p>Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins playfully commented on Travis Kelce's noticeable back hair, which had recently gone viral on social media. Speaking with E! News, Cousins humorously acknowledged Taylor Swift's acceptance of Kelce's hairy physique, attributing it to "genetics" and expressing relief that he doesn't share the same trait. Kelce had previously discussed his body hair on the "New Heights" podcast, jokingly comparing himself to a "Yeti" during his college basketball days due to his extensive hair growth. Kelce is preparing for his 13th season with the Chiefs, coming off a 2024 season with 97 receptions, 823 yards, and three touchdowns, though the Chiefs lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after an unruly passenger tried to open an exit door mid-flight. The man was restrained by fellow passengers and crew members before the plane landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Port of Seattle Police determined the passenger was experiencing a medical crisis and transported him to a local hospital for treatment, while it remains unclear if the man will face any charges. A second unrelated incident involved another unruly passenger who was also removed by police in Seattle, before the flight continued to Houston after a delay of several hours.</p>

          <p>President Trump has again criticized Harvard University, days after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education," further stating that his administration wants to know the identities of these students. Harvard had argued that the revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" for rejecting government control over its governance and curriculum. A hearing is scheduled to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be extended.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren secured his first Monaco Grand Prix victory, leading from pole position ahead of Charles Leclerc of Ferrari and Oscar Piastri, also of McLaren. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with only an early virtual safety car intervention after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto. Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri all followed a similar strategy, starting on medium tires and switching to two stints on hard tires. Max Verstappen, starting at a disadvantage with limited tire options, finished fourth after a late pit stop.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the passage of the budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years," while downplaying concerns about its potential to raise federal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis suggests the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Despite skepticism from Republican senators, Johnson rejected the CBO analysis, claiming it is "dramatically overstated," and he asserted that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing U.S. manufacturing.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a strong affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence amid tensions with the U.S. and President Trump. The move is seen as a theatrical display meant to differentiate Canada from the U.S., countering Trump's suggestion of it becoming a "51st state." The invitation comes at a time when Canada seeks to strengthen its ties with Europe and assert its unique identity, with a former governor of the Bank of England speaking about the need for Canada to find new allies.</p>

Tyler, known for novels like "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant" and "The Accidental Tourist," finds inspiration in overheard conversations and everyday people, which she jots down in her "blue box" of notes.

Currently, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects species by preventing harm to their habitat, but the Trump administration seeks to redefine "harm" to exclude habitat destruction. An ecosystem-protection act could be a unifying cause, as love for American landscapes is bipartisan, and protecting ecosystems would not necessarily mean outlawing all human use inside them.</p>
