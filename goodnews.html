          <p>The auction of Louise Riggio's art collection at Christie's in New York, featuring works by masters like Mondrian and Picasso, yielded $272 million, but fell short of pre-sale expectations due to economic uncertainties surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Despite guarantees from the auction house, bidding was subdued, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn, signaling weakness in that market. While some paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Monet sold well, others, like a Fontana, saw a significant drop in value compared to previous sales. The article suggests a cautious outlook for the art market, with experts emphasizing the need for hard work to maintain a healthy market amid financial uncertainty.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly 30 years, the EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but data obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) reveals progress in reducing emissions, although not fast enough to meet climate goals. The report, examining data from 1990-2023, found that gross greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17% since 2005. However, the EDF is concerned that new policies passed by the Trump administration might worsen carbon pollution in the future. The transportation sector remains the top-emitting sector, and the U.S. needs to further accelerate the pace of emissions reductions.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the US and Japan are in a race to discover why the Universe exists by studying neutrinos and antineutrinos. The US-based Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese-led Hyper K experiment are building detectors to observe these sub-atomic particles and their antimatter counterparts. By analyzing how neutrinos and antineutrinos change as they travel, scientists hope to understand why matter and antimatter didn't cancel each other out after the Big Bang. The article highlights the international collaboration and technological advancements driving these ambitious projects.</p>
