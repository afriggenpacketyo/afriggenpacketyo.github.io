          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Maintain Interest Rates Despite Presidential Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Trump for a substantial cut to stimulate the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has attributed the central bank's cautious stance to the inflationary risks created by the administration's tariff agenda. While markets do not foresee an immediate rate reduction, there is speculation about a potential cut later in the year. However, economists caution that a lower federal funds rate does not automatically guarantee reduced borrowing costs for consumers on products like mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a move amplified by France's recent commitment to do so. A parliamentary foreign affairs committee report, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" and should not be conditional on a long-term peace deal. However, the government's current position, shared by Conservative MPs, is that recognition should be part of a broader two-state solution. This debate places Starmer in a delicate position as he navigates domestic political demands and international diplomatic complexities.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly considering a move for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, as a potential replacement if their current star, Alexander Isak, leaves the club. Isak, who has attracted interest from Liverpool, did not join the team for its pre-season tour in Asia, officially due to a minor injury, fueling speculation about his future. Sesko had previously been linked with several top clubs, including Arsenal and Chelsea. Newcastle's move for the Slovenian international appears contingent on the departure of Isak, whose exit would create a significant void in their attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Mike Rogers in his second consecutive bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Michigan. Rogers, a former U.S. Representative, lost the 2024 election to Democrat Elissa Slotkin but is running again for the same position. In a social media post, Trump called Rogers an "America First Patriot" and gave him his "Complete and Total Endorsement." This endorsement echoes Trump's support for Rogers in the previous election cycle, a move that drew sharp criticism from some conservative figures like Senator Rand Paul at the time.</p>

          <h2>MLS Home-Field Advantage Diminishes, Aligning with European Soccer Norms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant decline in home-field advantage, with home teams' win percentages dropping from a historical high of around 60% to the mid-40s, a level comparable to top European leagues. This shift is not seen as a sign of decline but rather as an indicator of the league's growing maturity and competitiveness. Factors contributing to this trend include improved travel logistics for away teams, such as charter flights and circadian science-based scheduling, which mitigate the effects of vast travel distances. Additionally, enhanced refereeing with VAR and more sophisticated away-game tactics have helped level the playing field.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds People Relate More to Neurotic Robots Despite Preferring Extroverted Ones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human reactions to robots with distinct personalities, finding that people generally preferred interacting with an extroverted robot. However, the experiment also revealed that participants found a robot programmed with a neurotic personality to be more human-like and relatable. While the extroverted bot was seen as more enjoyable, the neurotic one, which spoke tentatively and expressed worries, was perceived as having a deeper understanding of emotions. This research suggests that personality traits beyond simple extroversion could play a crucial role in developing more effective and relatable human-robot interactions in the future.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Renewed Interest in Acquiring Movie Studios Amid Industry Struggles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a declining theatrical box office and an uncertain streaming market, there is a surprising surge in interest for acquiring movie studios, exemplified by Legendary Entertainment's potential bid for Lionsgate. The primary driver for these deals is the immense value of intellectual property (IP) found in a studio's film and television library. This IP can be leveraged for sequels, reboots, merchandise, theme parks, and licensing, creating diverse and long-term revenue streams beyond the original production. For buyers, a studio is not just a cash cow but a strategic asset that unlocks a broader entertainment ecosystem, making it an attractive investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper from Oxford researchers argues that recent claims about AI systems being capable of deception and scheming are based on weak evidence and may be influenced by researcher bias. The authors draw a parallel to flawed 1970s research on teaching sign language to apes, where scientists over-interpreted results due to preconceived notions. They contend that many experiments demonstrating AI deception are contrived scenarios where the AI is explicitly prompted to behave maliciously, revealing a capability but not an inherent propensity to do so. The paper calls for more rigorous, quantitative analysis to avoid groupthink and better understand the true risks posed by AI.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's policy on Ukraine, while inconsistent, does not align with the simple narrative that he is a Russian agent seeking a Ukrainian defeat. The article points out that U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine have largely continued and that Trump has supported a NATO deal for allies to purchase American weapons for Kyiv. The author suggests Trump's actions are driven by a dislike of war's destruction, a desire not to be seen as a 'chump' by Putin, and an ambition to be a peacemaker. While acknowledging the dangers of his unpredictability, the piece concludes the policy is more nuanced and less damaging than many critics believe.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its "black box" warning label from low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments used for menopause symptoms. They argue the current warning, which lists risks of cancer and dementia, is not supported by science for these localized treatments and unnecessarily scares women away from beneficial medication. The debate reflects a broader shift in the medical consensus on hormone replacement therapy, which fell out of favor two decades ago due to overstated risks. While advocates celebrate the renewed attention, some experts criticize the process as lacking scientific rigor.</p>
