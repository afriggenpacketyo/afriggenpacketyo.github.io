          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom has shifted from ceremonial events with the royal family at Windsor Castle to substantive political and trade discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Key topics on the agenda include refining the U.S.-U.K. trade deal, addressing tariffs on British steel, and coordinating on global conflicts. The visit has been marked by what some analysts call an "unlikely friendship" between the two leaders and has coincided with the announcement of £150 billion in new investments into the U.K., which the British government has hailed as a major economic boost.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett described the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut as a "prudent call," signaling the White House's general acceptance of the decision. While some within the administration had hoped for a more aggressive half-point reduction, Hassett framed the incremental move as a sensible first step toward lower rates. This more measured tone contrasts sharply with President Trump's previous public criticisms of the central bank, suggesting a temporary alignment on the direction of U.S. monetary policy.

          <p>Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison has built one of the world's largest fortunes by defying conventional wealth management advice, primarily by holding onto his vast Oracle stock and borrowing heavily against it. Instead of diversifying through share sales, Ellison has pledged over $82 billion worth of his stock as collateral to fund extensive spending on real estate, sports teams, and media ventures. This high-risk, high-leverage strategy has allowed him to maintain his 41% ownership stake in Oracle while simultaneously funding a massive personal and philanthropic empire.

The device enables users to view notifications and videos and can be controlled through hand gestures via a new neural-powered wristband. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's existing audio-only glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. Alongside this launch, the company also announced updated versions of its other smart eyewear collaborations with both Ray-Ban and Oakley.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has affirmed that he and teammate Lando Norris are in complete agreement regarding their approach to racing as they both compete for the Formula 1 championship. His comments come in the wake of the controversial Italian Grand Prix, where the team instructed Piastri to cede a position to Norris to correct for a prior pit-stop error affecting the Briton. Piastri, who currently leads Norris in the driver standings, stated that the team has since clarified its protocols for such scenarios to ensure fairness and maintain a unified front.</p>

          <p>Climate activists across the United States are preparing for "Sun Day," a national day of action designed to promote solar power and energy efficiency. Spearheaded by veteran activist Bill McKibben, the demonstrations serve as a direct response to the Trump administration's ongoing rollback of climate protections and its support for the fossil fuel industry. The events aim to shift the narrative from defense to offense by highlighting the rapid growth and economic viability of renewable energy. Planned activities include solar panel installations on affordable homes and concerts powered by electric trucks.</p>

          <p>For adults feeling disconnected from their childhood creativity, experts suggest it is possible to re-engage that playful instinct through simple, low-pressure habits. This article recommends tapping into past interests to find activities that are genuinely enjoyable, as this boosts motivation and makes the habit more likely to stick. It is also crucial to keep the stakes low by focusing on the process rather than a perfect outcome, and to share creations with others for connection instead of immediately trying to monetize them, which can stifle exploratory thinking.</p>

          <p>Will Shu, the co-founder and CEO of Deliveroo, has announced he will step down from his role once the company's acquisition by U.S. competitor DoorDash is finalized. Shu established the food delivery service in 2013, guiding it to become a major player in the European market. The £2.9 billion takeover by DoorDash, which is expected to close in October, will mark the end of Deliveroo's challenging period as a publicly traded company, a journey that began with a difficult initial public offering in 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has voted 7-2 to hold its key interest rate steady at 4%, as it balances persistent inflation against a fragile economic outlook. The decision was widely anticipated, particularly after recent data showed inflation remained unchanged at 3.8% in August, well above the bank's 2% target. In its announcement, the bank reiterated its commitment to controlling inflation but also opted to slow the pace of selling government bonds to minimize market disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported mixed first-quarter financial results, falling short of profit expectations while meeting revenue forecasts. The company's performance was bolstered by strong same-store sales growth of 5.9% at Olive Garden and 5.5% at LongHorn Steakhouse, which helped to offset continued weakness in its fine-dining segment. Despite the earnings miss, Darden raised its full-year sales outlook, signaling confidence in its core casual dining brands to continue attracting customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an ambitious conservation effort, New Zealand is leveraging advanced technology to save its unique, flightless birds like the kākāpō and takahē from extinction. The nation aims to completely eliminate invasive predators such as rats and stoats by 2050, a massive undertaking that demands innovative solutions beyond traditional trapping. Researchers are now deploying AI-powered automated traps and exploring cutting-edge genetic research, including the potential use of "gene drives" that could prevent predators from breeding, making the large-scale eradication project more effective and financially feasible.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has adjusted its martial law policy to permit men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country freely. This strategic change is intended to prevent a permanent "brain drain" by giving young men, particularly students, the flexibility to travel without the fear of being barred from returning to their homes. While some critics express concern that not all who leave will come back, the government believes this freedom will ultimately keep more young people connected to Ukraine, as they are not subject to military mobilization until they reach the age of 25.</p>

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, delves into themes of paranoia and extremism that the actor says resonate with today's polarized society. DiCaprio stars as a paranoid ex-revolutionary living off-grid who is forced to confront his past when his daughter goes missing. The actor stated that the film, which has been in development for two decades, holds a mirror up to cultural divisiveness without being preachy. The movie, which also stars Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, has already received strong positive reviews from critics.</p>
