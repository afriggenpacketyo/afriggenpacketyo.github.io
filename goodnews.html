          <p>Dominion Voting Systems and Rudy Giuliani have reached a confidential settlement in the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit over Giuliani's baseless 2020 election-rigging claims. The agreement leads to the permanent dismissal of the suit against the former New York City mayor and former personal lawyer to President Trump. This settlement follows similar large payouts by Fox News and Newsmax to Dominion, underscoring the legal and financial repercussions for those who spread unproven conspiracy theories about the 2020 election results. Giuliani has faced multiple legal and financial setbacks stemming from his role in disseminating election conspiracy theories, including disbarment and significant judgments.</p>

          <p>Europe established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the USA heading into the final day's Ryder Cup singles matches, needing only 2.5 more points to retain the trophy. This historic lead was achieved despite disruptive and abusive behavior from some American spectators, particularly directed at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, which drew widespread criticism. The article highlights Europe's exceptional performance, contrasting it with American capitulation and rising tensions both on and off the course, including a heated exchange between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau. This dominant display has already made history with Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, making Sunday's matches a mere formality for retention.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing vote on contentious issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse and the increasingly partisan tone of Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. He recounts his personal evolution on issues, notably his decisive role in the gay marriage decision and his conflicted stance on abortion, emphasizing that "the cases swung, not me." The article also details his views against originalism and his poignant reconciliation with Justice Scalia before his death.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the scientific efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, revealing mixed opinions from experts. While some users report noticeable improvements in skin and hair, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral supplements' ability to effectively reach and impact skin cells. Collagen is a large molecule, and even hydrolyzed forms face challenges in absorption and targeted delivery within the body. Topical collagen creams are deemed ineffective for deeper skin layers. Experts ultimately recommend proven methods like sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking as more impactful for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony McGill defeated fellow Scot John Higgins 6-3, winning four consecutive frames to secure his place in the British Open snooker final against Shaun Murphy. McGill, currently ranked 57th, achieved his first final in eight years and his fourth ranking final overall, marking a significant comeback in his career after facing potential tour relegation. In the other semi-final, Shaun Murphy comfortably beat defending champion Mark Selby 6-1, ending his own 26-month drought without a ranking title. The final match will see McGill compete for the £100,000 top prize against Murphy.</p>

Leeds had led for much of the game but failed to convert their dominance into enough points, allowing St Helens to complete a stunning turnaround with a 16-pass move that secured their semi-final trip to Hull KR.</p>
