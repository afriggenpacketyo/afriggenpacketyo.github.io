          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide relief for individuals struggling with various types of debt, but not all debts are eligible. Credit card debt, medical debt, and some private student loans and unsecured personal loans may qualify for debt forgiveness through settlement programs. Federal student loans, tax debt, child support, alimony, and secured debt like mortgages and car loans typically do not qualify. The article advises those considering debt forgiveness to understand which debts can realistically be reduced or eliminated and to consult with a debt relief expert for guidance.</p>

          <p>Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik has cautioned that US tariffs on imports will lead to significant price increases in the affordable jewelry industry. While current tariffs are manageable, reverting to previously announced reciprocal rates would be game-changing for jewelry manufacturers, most of whom import from Asia. The company, known for its charm bracelets and silver jewelry, is heavily dependent on manufacturing in Asia, and President Trump's tariff announcement has prompted warnings of a potential hit to group revenues. The article notes that the final level of price rises is likely to be industry-led.</p>

The article suggests shopping your junk drawer, buying in bulk, and looking for used items to save money.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savers may be wondering whether to renew their maturing CD accounts. Despite potential cuts, renewing can still be a smart move because the rate cut trajectory could easily change, and the rate cuts, when they come, are likely to be small. Savers would also lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim, as alternatives like high-yield savings accounts have variable rates and traditional savings accounts have much lower rates. The article advises savers to consider their economic needs and weigh the benefits of continuing to earn elevated interest on their money.</p>

          <p>Senior British trade negotiators are in Washington to continue talks on a trade agreement with the US, aiming to finalize a deal before the UK-EU summit. However, President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on films produced in foreign lands has caused concern, as Britain offers generous tax reliefs to attract film productions. The UK is seeking tariff relief on steel, aluminum, and cars in exchange for a lower rate on the digital services tax. The article notes that officials are racing to sign the US agreement before the planned UK-EU summit, at which both sides will set out their formal negotiating positions.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, a HELOC could be a homeowner's cheapest option to borrow $100,000, but should be approached strategically. A HELOC is currently the cheapest way to borrow home equity, and is likely to become less expensive in the months ahead. Due to the variable interest rate, borrowers need to price in volatility for the long term, and it may be worth locking in a home equity loan rate instead if a HELOC is unaffordable.</p>

          <p>With the federal funds rate on hold, homeowners may be exploring their home equity loan and HELOC borrowing options. A HELOC is arguably better than a home equity loan currently, presuming borrowers have the flexibility to adjust their payments as the variable HELOC rate changes. Borrowers would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative than a HELOC now, which is not only the cheapest way to borrow home equity as of early May 2025, but it's also one of the cheapest ways to borrow money overall. The article recommends closely comparing both home equity loans and HELOCs before formally applying to ensure affordability.</p>
