          <p>The wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran has been released from ICE detention after being held for two months in Louisiana. The 25-year-old mother of two was detained in May during a green card application interview, an event her husband described as a betrayal. Her detention occurred while she was still breastfeeding their infant daughter, and her case highlights the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies, which have increased arrests by over 120% compared to the previous administration. While released on bond with an ankle monitor, she still faces a lengthy immigration court process.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the purchase of military equipment. The scheme allegedly involved inflating the prices of state contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests followed the recent restoration of independence for the country's anti-corruption bodies after a public backlash against a government bill that sought to limit their power.</p>

The article recounts Ethereum's journey, highlighting its role in powering decentralized finance, NFTs, and the tokenization of real-world assets. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's unexpected growth while warning against the risks of centralization as mainstream institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank adopt the technology. Experts believe Ethereum is becoming the essential "plumbing" for the future of finance, moving trillions in value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests. The court affirmed that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before making a stop, a decision praised by immigrant advocates.</p>

The 26-year-old Slovenian guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, stating his commitment to bringing championships to the city. The extension solidifies his role as the future cornerstone of the franchise, particularly as the team prepares for a post-LeBron James era.

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is establishing a new left-wing political party in the UK alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, and they are asking supporters to help choose its name. The new venture, which so far has no official title, has reportedly attracted over 600,000 registered supporters. Before it can field candidates in elections, the party must register a name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. Political experts note that a strong, modern name is crucial for brand recognition in an era of declining traditional party allegiances.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has stated that the premature death of his stepfather from cancer was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the medical profession and was at the "end of his tether" with the emotional strain of the job. He recalled his stepfather's death at age 54 as a wake-up call, making him realize he did not want to spend his life in a career he was not passionate about. The move proved successful, leading to a long career in entertainment with popular shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a prominent advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts sharply with China's approach, where a highly competitive open-source ecosystem is driving rapid advancements in AI technology. AI expert Andrew Ng noted that while top proprietary models still come from the US, the best open models are now mostly from China. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently released powerful new open-source models, positioning the country to potentially surpass the U.S. in the field.</p>

          <p>A group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca is reportedly finalizing a deal to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million and relocate the team to Boston.

The Sun, currently owned by the Mohegan Tribe, have been one of the league's most consistently successful teams but lack the modern facilities of many rivals.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favour during World War Two. While popular legend claimed the creature died from shell-shock after an encounter with a German U-boat, newly examined archival records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the ship's attendant show that as the vessel crossed the equator, water and air temperatures rose well above the safe threshold for the species, essentially meaning the platypus likely died from heat exposure.</p>
