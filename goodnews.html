          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a sophisticated drug trafficking operation across southeast England. Deborah Mason recruited her children and other family members to transport cocaine with a street value up to £80 million, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The Metropolitan Police conducted a seven-month surveillance operation, tracking the gang's activities from ports to various cities. The judge highlighted her leading role in the criminal enterprise, noting she corrupted her own family for financial gain while receiving state benefits.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The novel approach uses gene therapy tools to generate anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body, eliminating the complex and expensive external manufacturing process. A study published in The Lancet details the successful treatment of four patients with multiple myeloma using this in-vivo technique. This innovation could dramatically reduce the cost of CAR-T therapy, which currently can exceed one million yuan (US$139,200) per treatment, making it potentially accessible to a much wider range of patients globally.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has summoned major e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com, to address concerns over intense price wars in the food delivery sector. The regulator urged the firms to engage in rational competition and foster a healthy ecosystem that benefits consumers, merchants, and delivery riders. The meeting emphasized the need for these platforms to adhere to laws regarding e-commerce, anti-unfair competition, and food safety. This intervention signals Beijing's ongoing efforts to rein in the aggressive business practices of its technology giants and ensure more stable and fair market conditions.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Positive Signs in Return from Injury Despite Team Loss</h2>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his second start since returning from the injured list, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive development, showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more effective, simplified mental approach on the mound. He has been working to overcome a history of injuries and mental blocks by focusing more on being athletic and competitive rather than overthinking his mechanics. The Dodgers are counting on Glasnow and the eventual return of Blake Snell to fortify their starting rotation for a championship run.</p>

          <p>Beijing's top disciplinary commission is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, intended as a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after poor decision-making and a broken capital chain, wasting hundreds of millions of yuan. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection condemned local officials for making "blind decisions out of touch with reality." This public shaming serves as a stark warning to other local governments across China to avoid vanity projects and ensure responsible use of public funds and resources.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful 'X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic weapon design, an 'X-railgun,' intended to be significantly more powerful than the navy's current model. The existing naval railgun, a global first, has been limited by its power, as excessive current can damage the weapon and restricts projectiles to a weight too light for sinking large ships. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which they calculate would nearly double the force and allow for much heavier projectiles. This development aims to overcome existing technological hurdles and advance the military application of electromagnetic weaponry.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that about two-thirds of Americans favor the U.S. undertaking missions to return to the moon and eventually send astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The survey also shows that the 1969 moon landing is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributed to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, indicating a general public consensus on the value of continuing America's space program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are leveraging open-source AI to challenge the closed, proprietary systems of American giants such as OpenAI and Google. By making their large language models (LLMs) and source code freely available, these companies are fostering a collaborative global development environment and creating viable alternatives for developers worldwide. This movement has gained significant traction, redefining the global AI landscape after US firms initially restricted access to their advanced models in China. Analysts suggest that this open-source strategy poses a more serious challenge to US dominance than previous efforts in other software sectors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce terms reportedly include the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as the director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency visited Washington to discuss potential plans for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. A Hamas spokesperson indicated the group favors an interim truce but may revert to demanding a full deal.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a larger aid package to support the country's defense against Russia's invasion. The tanks are part of a A$245 million ($160 million) contribution, with most of the 49 promised vehicles having already arrived in Ukraine. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment, since the conflict began. The Australian Defence Minister stated the tanks will make a significant contribution to Ukraine's fight against what Canberra has labeled an illegal and immoral invasion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War by daydreaming about a carousel in a mountain meadow has brought that vision to life. Scott Harrison, who battled PTSD after his service, spent 26 years building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, hand-carving its unique animals. The carousel, which opened in 2010 as a nonprofit, was conceived from a memory of a music box his sister sent him during the war, which provided a mental escape from the brutality. Now, his creation has delighted over a million people and has become a source of profound healing and joy for Harrison himself.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which supporters claim will facilitate faster and cheaper transactions while strengthening the dollar's role. The administration hailed the law as a significant step in bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system and a validation for the crypto community. This legislation is intended to provide clear guardrails and consumer protections for the growing stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>
