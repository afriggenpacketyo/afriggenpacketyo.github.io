          <p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK has officially confirmed its use of artificial intelligence to monitor social media posts as part of criminal investigations targeting suspected tax cheats. The agency emphasized that this technology will not replace human decision-making and is subject to legal oversight, aiming to improve efficiency by allowing staff to focus less on administration and more on assisting taxpayers and combating fraud. While experts acknowledge AI's potential for streamlining processes, they also caution about inherent risks, such as cases of mistaken identity arising from fake or hacked social media accounts. HMRC's broader focus with AI also includes developing tools to help taxpayers file returns correctly and access extensive online guidance.</p>

          <p>Lior Ron, the founder and CEO of Uber Freight, is transitioning to self-driving truck startup Waabi as chief operating officer, driven by his conviction that the era of autonomous big rigs operating at scale on U.S. roads is now here. Waabi anticipates deploying fully driverless trucks on commercial freight routes across the U.S. Southwest by the end of the year, with an ambitious goal to cover all of North America within the next five years. Ron, who will remain chairman of Uber Freight, views autonomous freight as the most fundamental shift of the next decade, promising to more than double daily cargo movement capabilities and offer enhanced safety and fuel efficiency compared to traditional trucking, while also addressing the longstanding driver shortage.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty experienced a 30% decline in net income in its first fiscal quarter following President Donald Trump's tariffs, yet CEO Tarang Amin expresses strong confidence, highlighting the company's impressive 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and ongoing international expansion. A key strategic move is the recent $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, which will introduce E.l.f. into Sephora stores this fall. Despite financing this substantial deal with $600 million of debt, financial experts are cautiously optimistic about Rhode's rapid growth and its potential to be highly accretive for E.l.f. The company continues to challenge legacy beauty players, having celebrated its first billion-dollar fiscal year in May 2024 and maintaining its position as a top brand among younger consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 have benefited savers, experts are now guiding consumers on the optimal choice between money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts amidst a shifting rate climate. Both savings vehicles offer variable, typically higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, providing a safe place to park funds. The key distinction lies in accessibility: money market accounts often come with debit cards and checks, potentially requiring higher minimum balances or tiered APYs, while high-yield savings accounts generally have lower barriers to entry. Financial advisors recommend money market accounts for those needing occasional access to a large nest egg, while high-yield savings are ideal for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals.

          <p>As year-end approaches, many older Americans face the obligation of taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their pretax retirement accounts starting at age 73, and financial experts are offering smart strategies for those who don't immediately need the money. One option is to reinvest RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) often recommended over mutual funds for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. For charitable investors, a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) directly from an IRA to a non-profit can satisfy RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be strategically used to contribute to 529 college savings plans for family members, potentially securing state tax breaks while planning for future generations.

Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has publicly stated that Isak cannot be involved in his current plans, suggesting the player will miss the upcoming Premier League opener. Isak, who scored an impressive 27 goals in 42 appearances last season, still has three years remaining on his contract with Newcastle.</p>

          <p>Do Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur infamous for the 2022 collapse of his TerraUSD and Luna digital currencies, which resulted in an estimated $40 billion loss, is reportedly planning to plead guilty to two charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud in a U.S. court. Kwon was initially indicted on nine counts, accused of misleading investors in 2021 by secretly arranging for a high-frequency trading firm to artificially prop up TerraUSD's value. This development follows his 2024 agreement to pay an $80 million civil fine and face a ban from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. His guilty plea marks a significant step in the ongoing legal actions against major figures in the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>
