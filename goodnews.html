          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it will acquire Fl√§ktGroup, a heating and cooling solutions provider, for 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion). This acquisition aims to expand Samsung's presence in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) market, which is experiencing rapid growth. Fl√§ktGroup supplies HVAC solutions to a wide range of facilities, including data centers, and Samsung anticipates sustained growth in this area due to increasing demand from generative AI, robotics, and autonomous driving technologies. Samsung plans to increase revenue in its HVAC business by more than 30% in 2025.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and shift government roles to offices across the country. The aim is to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94m annually by 2032, with new government campuses opening in Manchester and Aberdeen. This initiative seeks to bring decision-making closer to communities and better reflect the country, with government departments submitting relocation plans. The Labour government intends to shrink the civil service and reduce government running costs by 15% by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, have been resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step towards their potential release after more than three decades. Judge Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts and support from corrections officials as key factors in his decision, noting they have earned the chance to seek parole, though the ultimate decision rests with the governor and parole board. The case has garnered renewed attention, with many believing the brothers were mistreated by the criminal justice system and media during their initial trial. The brothers apologized for their actions, expressing remorse for the pain they caused their family, with the hearing focusing on their rehabilitation rather than relitigating the crime itself.</p>
