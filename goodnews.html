          <p>PayPal has partnered with the Big Ten and Big 12 conferences to facilitate payments to student-athletes, enabling them to receive compensation through PayPal's platform. This agreement follows a court settlement in the House v. NCAA case, which allows schools to compensate athletes for the first time. The deal will allow athletic departments to distribute payments using PayPal, offering students quick and secure access to their compensation, with the option to pay tuition via PayPal at select schools. Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark anticipates other conferences will follow suit, with the ACC expected to be next, as the program rolls out across campuses nationwide.</p>

          <p>The British pound briefly reached its highest level against the dollar in almost four years following a report that President Trump may accelerate the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve. Trump has criticized current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns about the Fed's independence, and the market is pricing in the possibility of Trump appointing someone more sympathetic to his policies. Concerns about the Fed's independence could lead to higher borrowing costs if investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt. The US economy shrank in the first quarter of the year, increasing concerns that Trump's tariffs will push up inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank at a faster rate than previously estimated during the first quarter of 2025, marking the first contraction in three years, with the gross domestic product falling at an annual rate of 0.5%. This decline was attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to buy foreign goods before tariffs took effect, although consumer spending also slowed significantly. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that businesses stocking up on inventory early in the year delayed the inflationary impact of tariffs, and economists predict a rebound in economic growth for the second quarter. Despite the contraction, experts anticipate a recovery, forecasting a 3% growth rate for the second quarter (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>After months of escalating tensions, analysts and former officials anticipate a pause in US-China trade relations as both countries retreat from extreme positions. This breather follows a high-stakes tariff battle and subsequent actions, such as China blocking rare earth exports and the US restricting jet engine and semiconductor software. The pause, which went into effect on May 12, is expected to last three months, with the US ensuring the resumption of rare earths exports and China seeking more organized negotiations. While the Iran crisis adds uncertainty, its impact on any US-China deal is expected to be minimal.</p>

The panel also voted on whether to include the drug in the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines to about half of American children.

          <p>For those nearing or entering retirement, a $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide a monthly income of approximately $1,200 to $1,300 for life, according to current estimates. The actual payout depends on factors such as gender, the type of annuity chosen, and the prevailing interest rate environment. Annuities can act as a personal pension, providing guaranteed monthly income and hedging against longevity risk, but it's crucial to consider liquidity needs before investing. Shopping around and comparing quotes from different insurers is also recommended to ensure the product aligns with your overall retirement plan (not investment advice).</p>
