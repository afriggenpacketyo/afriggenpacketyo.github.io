          <p>A Soviet spacecraft named Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent to land on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after spending 53 years in orbit due to a failed rocket booster. The New York Times article notes that the spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Indonesia. This event serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus and achieved several firsts, including the first landing on another planet. The article also highlights the challenges faced by the Soviets in building spacecraft capable of surviving Venus's harsh environment.</p>

          <p>In California's "salad bowl," farmers are investing in housing for guest workers to stabilize their workforce amid an aging local population and stricter immigration enforcement. According to the Los Angeles Times, these investments aim to alleviate the affordable housing crisis in Monterey County. While some community members are skeptical, citing the need for affordable housing for local farmworkers, county officials view it as a win-win solution. With increased enforcement and potential self-deportation, California growers are seeking legal avenues like the H-2A visa program to secure their labor supply.</p>

          <p>Having children can change friendships, but maintaining those relationships requires communication and compassion, reports NPR. Parents and non-parents often make assumptions about each other's availability and interests, leading to social isolation. It is important to be flexible, inclusive, and open to having hard conversations to keep friendships strong. It's also important to recognize that some friendships may evolve or fade, and that's okay too.</p>
