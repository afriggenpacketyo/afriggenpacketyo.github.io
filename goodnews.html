          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in an extraordinary qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours due to numerous crashes and interruptions, saw Verstappen outperform Williams' Carlos Sainz in the final moments. Championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will start from seventh and ninth respectively, following crashes and suboptimal laps amid challenging, rainy conditions. The chaotic nature of the session underscores the difficulty of the Baku street circuit.</p>

John Saunby is constructing his dream home almost entirely from salvaged materials and rubble left in the storm's wake, including porch posts and kitchen floorboards he recovered from the wilderness. This project represents a personal "last hurrah" in home-building for Saunby, who is turning discarded items destined for a landfill into a unique and soulful house with the help of his partner, musician Jenny Kimmel.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to its seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries in her return from a concussion. Despite a resilient French side that kept the contest close, particularly in the first half, England's power and depth proved decisive in the second half. The Red Roses will now face Canada in a sold-out final at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next Saturday.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law designed for national emergencies and wartime, to clear the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to speed up decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued the emergency powers are necessary to secure the required funds and "get a grip" on the situation. The party also advocates for allowing asylum seekers to work while their claims are processed.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes achieved record highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. This first cut of the year, with signals of two more possible in 2025, pushed the funds rate to a range of 4% to 4.25% and was celebrated by investors. The week also saw significant stock movements for companies like CrowdStrike, which surged after a positive investor day, and Nvidia, which announced a major partnership with Intel. Apple's stock also jumped as the new iPhone 17 models were released to strong initial demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention. The family had previously expressed grave concerns about the couple's health while in custody.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the center of a 1998 political scandal to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discussed the crucial decision to reclaim her own narrative, starting with a 2014 essay, and how younger generations helped shift public perception by questioning the power dynamics of her situation. Lewinsky spoke about the importance of empathy, the changing language around consent and harassment, and her work in helping other women, like Amanda Knox, tell their stories. She emphasized that one can survive unimaginable public shame and insist on a different ending.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has been described by both sides as productive and constructive, raising hopes for increased stability in their bilateral relationship. The leaders discussed trade frictions and a deal on TikTok, and also announced plans to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea. Trump also indicated he plans to visit China early next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea, as well as potential U.S. tariff threats.</p>

          <p>The United States has seemingly adopted a less public approach to sailing its warships through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such transits were regularly announced under the previous administration to signal freedom of navigation, there have been only three known operations this year, confirmed by the U.S. only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically complained about the "public hype" surrounding these operations. Some Chinese observers suggest this shift is a tactical change rather than a substantive alteration of U.S. policy in the region.</p>

Starting from her attic with an at-home service, the company is now a profitable enterprise with 90 studios across the U.S., employing registered nurses as piercers and bringing in over $70 million in revenue last year. The business model, which combines medical safety with retail, was born from Schneider's own search for a safe piercing option for her daughter and has successfully filled a gap in the market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading dermatologist is advising that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while sitting indoors near a window. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, contributing to accelerated aging and skin cancer, and can affect people without their knowledge since they don't cause a burning sensation. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended time near windows.</p>
