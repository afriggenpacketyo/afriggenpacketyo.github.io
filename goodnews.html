          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge in its stock value, rising over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut and recently surpassing a $430 billion market capitalization. A key driver of this growth has been its government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, the company's valuation has reached astronomical levels, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, indicating high investor expectations for its AI-powered software.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2018, boys have outperformed girls in achieving the highest A-level grades in the UK, with 28.4% of boys' entries graded A* or A compared to 28.2% for girls. This narrow reversal is partly attributed to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are predominantly taken by male students and tend to yield a higher proportion of top grades. While maths remains the most popular A-level, the gender divide in the subject is widening. In contrast, humanities subjects like English and history have seen a decline in entries.</p>

She conceived the idea at age 12, and it was later developed into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales, with units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As one of ten young women honored globally for their community impact, Rebecca's achievement was also celebrated with a custom Lego mini-figure, part of the magazine's partnership with the toy company.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., legal experts suggest a similar federal intervention in other major U.S. cities is unlikely. The analysis highlights that Washington D.C.'s unique status as a federal district grants the president direct authority over its National Guard, a power that does not extend to states where governors hold command. The article notes that historical precedent and laws like the Posse Comitatus Act create significant legal and political barriers to using military forces for domestic law enforcement in other municipalities, making replication of the D.C. action difficult.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Evolving and Contested Definition of 'Genius' Through History</h2>

          <p>This article delves into the historical quest to define "genius," tracing the term from its Latin origins as an individual's guiding spirit to its modern use as a label for extraordinary individuals. It examines how 19th-century thinkers, influenced by Darwinism, sought to explain genius through heredity, leading to the problematic field of eugenics pioneered by Francis Galton. The piece also highlights early critiques of these racialized theories and acknowledges the roles of luck, social conditions, and timing in fostering success. Ultimately, the article reflects on how the concept of genius remains subjective and contested, revealing much about societal values over time.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses a new Department of Energy report that acknowledges human-driven climate change but suggests it may not be the imminent catastrophe often portrayed. The author praises this middle-ground approach as a way to "elevate the debate" beyond polarized narratives of either outright denial or apocalyptic alarm. The report finds no convincing evidence of increased intensity in U.S. weather events and argues that the economic damage may be less than projected. The author concludes that fostering open, respectful debate and welcoming scrutiny is essential for crafting effective climate policy based on facts rather than fear.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high interest rates and living costs pressure household budgets, this article examines two major debt relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but often damages credit scores and may have tax implications. In contrast, debt management, typically arranged through a credit counseling agency, focuses on creating an affordable repayment plan with lower interest rates, allowing the debtor to repay the full amount over time while preserving their credit. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following criticism from residents and a local funeral director, who labeled it a "fat tax." The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6-foot-wide plot compared to a standard 5-foot one at Danescourt cemetery. The council had initially defended the move by citing increased demand and higher obesity rates in the city. However, after a BBC investigation highlighted public opposition, the local authority announced it would not proceed with the controversial charges.</p>

The bid comes as Google awaits a judge's decision on remedies following a landmark antitrust ruling that found it holds a monopoly in the search market. The U.S. Department of Justice has explicitly called for the divestiture of Chrome to foster competition. While analysts are skeptical of the offer's seriousness, it underscores the significant challenges Google faces from both regulators and AI-powered competitors.</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reiterated the insurer's strong commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite growing political resistance in the US and UK. The statement came as Aviva's shares reached their highest point since the 2008 financial crisis, driven by a 22% jump in operating profit. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the insurance business, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. The company's stance contrasts with several major US and UK banks that have recently withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest level since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declining rates, providing a modest boost in affordability for potential homebuyers in a housing market that has been sluggish due to high borrowing costs. The drop in mortgage rates is linked to a recent decrease in the 10-year Treasury yield, which has been influenced by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate next month amid signs of a cooling job market.</p>
