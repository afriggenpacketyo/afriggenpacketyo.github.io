          <p>Liverpool has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their 28-year-old forward, Luis Diaz. The Premier League club has made it clear to Bayern's director of sport that Diaz is not for sale and they will not engage in any discussions regarding a potential transfer. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers the Colombia international, who scored 22 goals last season, an integral part of their squad and is adamant about keeping him at the club.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last. In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he affirmed that his successor should be found and recognized according to traditional Buddhist practices. He explicitly stated that the process should be managed by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, signaling that China, which claims authority to approve the next leader, should not interfere. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and view the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, for £2.65 billion, a move that would create the UK's third-largest bank. Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which likely means the TSB brand will disappear from the High Street, following the pattern of past acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. While the deal awaits shareholder and regulatory approval, Santander has indicated that the merger will lead to efficiency savings, likely resulting in job cuts and branch closures, particularly where there is overlap. The deal is expected to close in early 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's stock has surged over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024, driven by strong same-store sales growth and a powerful online presence.

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a move to crack down on the intense price wars affecting many of the country's industries. At a high-level economic meeting, Xi used the specific phrase "disorderly low-price competition" to describe the issue, indicating a more targeted approach than the previously used term "involutionary competition." The government aims to regulate this behavior to protect innovation, improve product quality, and encourage the phasing out of outdated production capacity. The move is seen as crucial for the long-term health of the Chinese economy, which has been hampered by companies aggressively cutting prices to gain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived star guard Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now become a free agent. The move allows the Pacers to avoid luxury tax implications while their own star, Tyrese Haliburton, recovers from a similar injury. Lillard, who is likely to miss most or all of the upcoming season, will have his remaining $112.6 million contract paid out over five years.</p>

          <p>A new version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill includes an increased tax credit for semiconductor companies, raising it from 25% to 35% for building manufacturing plants in the U.S. This provision aims to further incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced chip production domestically, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The move is part of Washington's ongoing strategy to strengthen its own technology supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia.
