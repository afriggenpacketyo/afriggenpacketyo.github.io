          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Big Tech Companies Are Underspending on Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are in fact underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures to secure a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is both urgent and necessary to develop the most accurate AI models. He believes the company with the best chatbot could achieve a near-monopoly, leading to hundreds of billions in profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new Marvel film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” features a mid-credits scene that introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The scene depicts a cloaked figure, identified as Doom, interacting with Reed Richards and Sue Storm's son, Franklin, hinting at the plot for the team's next adventure. This sets the stage for the upcoming crossover film, “Avengers: Doomsday,” where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to return to the franchise to portray the villain. The film's setting on an alternate Earth also suggests the team's eventual multiversal journey to join the primary MCU timeline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Mexico's environmental ministry have signed a memorandum of understanding committing to a "100% solution" for the chronically polluted Tijuana River. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that President Trump was motivated to act after hearing from Navy SEALs who train in the contaminated waters. The agreement aims to expedite infrastructure improvements and redirect treated wastewater away from the river, with Mexico committing $93 million in previously allocated funds. While environmental groups praised the move as a major step, some local officials remain skeptical about whether the pollution will truly cease.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, currently in the third year of his modest rookie contract, is positioned for a significant contract extension next offseason. His breakout performance, which includes setting NFL rookie receiving records, makes him one of the league's best bargains, earning just over $1 million this season. Following the recent multi-million dollar extensions for other young receivers, Nacua's potential payday could be substantial if he maintains his high level of production. For now, Nacua states he is focused on staying present and preparing for the upcoming season alongside new teammate Davante Adams.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages in 500 U.S. restaurants, drawing inspiration from its recently shuttered drink-focused spinoff, CosMc's. The new drinks, including items like a Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and a Popping Tropic Refresher, are designed to appeal to Gen Z's taste for flavorful cold beverages. This move represents a strategic pivot, integrating the beverage concepts directly into existing McDonald's locations rather than operating standalone stores. The company hopes this beverage platform will boost sales and attract customers during afternoon snack breaks, a key growth opportunity.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, despite historical trends of the president's party losing seats. Johnson pointed to the 13 Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024 as key opportunities. He also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting voters will feel its economic benefits from tax cuts and that it will serve as "jet fuel" for the economy. He dismissed polling that shows public disapproval of the law as the result of misinformation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is constructing a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, located in Medog county in the southeastern Tibet autonomous region. This area is remote but geopolitically significant due to its proximity to the disputed border with India. The dam is a cornerstone of Beijing's strategy to develop the region, serving as both a major future energy source and a means to strengthen its security and control along the contested Himalayan frontier. The project underscores China's broader infrastructure and development goals in the strategically important Tibetan plateau.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a significant advancement for developing powerful laser weapons. The 60mm crystal can efficiently convert laser beams into mid- to far-infrared frequencies, which are ideal for long-distance transmission through the atmosphere. Notably, the material can withstand immense laser power, exceeding the damage threshold of existing military-grade crystals by an order of magnitude. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based lasers capable of targeting and disabling satellites in orbit, overcoming previous limitations where lasers would damage their own components.</p>

          <p>The number of job listings that mention artificial intelligence skills has been rising significantly, with a more than 100% increase in the last year alone, according to a Brookings Institution report. While AI-related jobs still represent a small fraction of the overall labor market, they have grown at an average annual rate of 29% over the past 15 years. Demand is increasing as more companies integrate AI, with roles ranging from specialized AI engineers to consultants who help with implementation. These positions are often associated with higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI requirement.</p>
