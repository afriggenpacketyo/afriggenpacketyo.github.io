          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order, which aimed to punish the firm, sent a message that lawyers must adhere to the party line. Howell found the executive order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, emphasizing the Constitution requires tolerance, not coercion, in response to dissenting viewpoints. The judge's decision underscores the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to represent clients without fear of government reprisal, ensuring the integrity of the legal system.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, two scientific groups, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on climate change impacts in the U.S. This collection aims to ensure that the scientists' work remains accessible, complementing rather than replacing the National Climate Assessment. The groups are inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work, emphasizing the importance of collaborative scientific efforts in addressing climate change. This initiative provides a critical pathway for researchers to contribute to solutions for climate change amid concerns that the official assessment may be less extensive.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reportedly Considering Executive Order to Regulate NIL Deals in College Sports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:26:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to regulate Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics after meeting with former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns that the influx of money has negatively impacted college sports and wants reforms to ensure a level playing field. Saban has previously urged Congress to establish national legislation to standardize NIL guidelines and protect the NCAA from litigation. The NCAA recently passed rules allowing colleges to pay athletes as a result of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement, but further regulation may be on the horizon.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products from China to the United States, opting instead to fulfill all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This shift comes as the Trump administration closed a loophole allowing low-cost Chinese-made items to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company had previously started adding import charges for U.S. customers buying items from China after Trump announced his intention to close the de minimis exemption. Temu says pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model, and it is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

Benjamin's reasoning won him top place in the China trials for the International Philosophy Olympiad.
