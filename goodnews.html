          <p>The University of California system offered admission to its largest-ever class of California first-year students for fall 2025, increasing the in-state admission rate to 77%. Despite financial pressures and a slight dip in total applicants, the data shows continued growth in racial diversity, with Latinos remaining the largest admitted group for the sixth year. The university also increased offers to international and out-of-state students to offset potential enrollment declines due to higher tuition and changing federal policies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) to open its interest rate meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the FOMC is not subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open meetings. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a firm whose CEO is an ally of President Trump, was a publicity stunt rather than a genuine legal challenge.</p>

          <p>The 4% rule is a well-known retirement guideline suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make savings last 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream of an annuity against traditional portfolio withdrawals. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout rate and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks inflation adjustments and flexibility. The article suggests that combining both strategies can offer a balance of security and growth for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

While lower rates historically boost gold prices, the metal's value has recently been more influenced by inflation and geopolitical concerns. With no Fed meeting in August, significant shifts in gold prices are not expected until at least September, unless there are unexpected comments from the Fed or changes in inflation data or global tensions.

          <p>Wall Street's anxiety about a potential recession sparked by President Trump's trade policies has lessened, as the effective tariff rates appear to be settling in a 15-20% range, lower than initially feared. While still a significant tax on foreign goods, the situation is seen as less dire due to a strong global growth backdrop and a more modest inflationary impact than predicted. Economists at institutions like JPMorgan Chase have lowered their recession risk, though they caution that further trade aggression could still negatively impact the economy.

          <p>A large new study provides strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve cognitive abilities in older adults. The two-year POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Those who followed an intensive regimen of aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training showed improved mental function equivalent to being one to two years younger. The results suggest that lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline.</p>
