          <p>President Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" ready to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, with their identities to be revealed soon. This development comes as the deadline for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest from the platform approaches, following a 2024 law aimed at addressing national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, indicated that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing. He has previously expressed a desire for the popular app to continue operating under new, American-led ownership.</p>

          <p>Global markets started the week with positive momentum, buoyed by news that trade talks between the U.S. and Canada are resuming. Canada agreed to rescind its digital services tax, a key U.S. demand, leading to a rise in Wall Street futures and firmness in European markets. This development, combined with declining oil prices, has encouraged investor confidence. However, analysts remain watchful of a massive U.S. tax and spending bill, which the CBO estimates could add $3.3 trillion to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's customs authority has announced an immediate, conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan. The measure reverses part of a full ban that was imposed in 2023 after Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. However, the suspension will remain in effect for ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. The initial ban was a point of significant diplomatic tension between the two nations, and this partial lifting may signal a step toward resetting relations.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the UK and the US has kicked in, allowing shiploads of British-made cars to head to America with a reduced tariff of 10%. The deal is expected to unleash pent-up demand after a 25% tariff imposed by the Trump administration had slowed exports. However, the agreement has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure concessions for the auto industry. The National Farmers' Union expressed concern over tariff-free quotas for American beef and the removal of tariffs on U.S. ethanol. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and researchers are beginning to understand why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into battery power, create a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. Researchers are now exploring solutions, such as using specifically designed audio tones, to help counteract the physical sensations that lead to motion sickness in EV passengers.</p>
