          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, also known as "razor blade throat," has been detected in several U.S. states and is currently the second most dominant variant in the country. The variant, derived from the omicron variant, appears to be more transmissible due to changes in the spike protein, which allows it to attach more easily to cells. While some experts report a painful sore throat is a common symptom, it is not yet confirmed if it is a definitive symptom of this variant. Health officials recommend staying up to date on vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and considering wearing masks in crowded areas to protect against the virus. </p>

She also recalled struggling to land roles early in her career, attributing the difficulty to her multiracial heritage. Markle expressed the importance of setting a positive example for her children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, emphasizing confidence, self-forgiveness, and kindness. </p>

Despite the fear caused by the raids, many residents are protesting and advocating for the undocumented community.

The movie becomes a sort of road movie that adopts different styles and techniques, following the family of Jamie, Isla, and their son Spike. The movie's visual style, filmed largely with iPhones 15 Pro Max, keeps the audience engaged. </p>

          <p>Diego Luna revealed that before "Star Wars," Hollywood primarily offered him roles as drug dealers. He noted that he was often asked if he would clean up his accent, which is no longer part of the conversation in the industry. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation in Hollywood, though Latinx actors remain underrepresented and are often typecast. Netflix has committed $1 billion to Mexico productions to create more opportunities for Latinx people. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden will be in Galveston, Texas, to join a Juneteenth Celebration Service at the historic Reedy Chapel AME Church. The church is one of the locations where an order announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read on June 19, 1865. In 2021, Biden signed into law a measure that made June 19, or Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Juneteenth became the nation's first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983. </p>
