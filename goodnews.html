          <p>The European Ryder Cup team established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States, requiring only two and a half more points from 12 singles matches for retention. This historic lead marks Europe's largest ever before the singles matches, reflecting a dominant performance against an American side struggling with leadership and form. The day was also marred by "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" from American galleries directed at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, prompting security intervention. Despite the unsportsmanlike conduct from some fans, Europe's pragmatic captain Luke Donald remains cautious, acknowledging the strength of the US team.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers a rare glimpse into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the swing justice. Kennedy asserts "The cases swung, not me," as the court became more conservative, expressing worry about the current antagonistic tone in American discourse and even within Supreme Court opinions. He reveals his internal conflicts on abortion, a moral wrong for him but not necessarily a legal one, and his evolving stance on gay marriage, influenced by the impact on children of gay parents. The article highlights his opposition to strict originalism, advocating for liberty's meaning to evolve over time.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic in health and wellness. While some users report benefits like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral supplements reaching the skin in effective quantities. Collagen is a large molecule, and even hydrolyzed peptides face challenges getting past the gut and into the dermis. Experts suggest marine collagen is preferable over bovine or vegan options, but ultimately, robust evidence supporting significant effects from oral or topical collagen is lacking. Dermatologists recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful anti-aging strategies.</p>

This marks McGill's first final appearance in eight years, a significant achievement for the player who had slipped to 57th in world rankings. In the other semi-final, Shaun Murphy comfortably beat defending champion Mark Selby 6-1, ending his 26-month title drought. McGill expressed delight at beating a "legend" like Higgins, calling it the biggest final of his career, while Murphy was also pleased with his strong performance leading into the Sunday showpiece.</p>

The dramatic 16-14 win at Headingley saw Saints secure their lead only after the final hooter, completing a mesmerizing 16-pass move across the pitch. This energy-sapping match also saw St Helens forward Matty Lees leave midway through as his wife went into labor, adding to the intense atmosphere. The hard-fought victory, achieved in the season's most frantic and decisive moment, now sets up a semi-final trip to Hull KR, keeping Saints' championship hopes alive.</p>

          <p>This article commemorates 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, alongside the 25th anniversary of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, by examining China's remarkable technological trajectory. It reflects on a historical moment when Chinese officials, after extensive tours in Europe, estimated China was at least two decades behind in science, technology, and industry. Now, half a century later, the dynamic has dramatically shifted, with the article posing the critical question of whether China has indeed surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future. This piece serves as an introduction to a series exploring the complex and evolving ties, particularly the technological script, between these two global powers.</p>

          <p>The Labour party has committed to initiating the construction of three new towns before the next general election, as part of its ambitious plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce identified Tempsford (Bedfordshire), Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill (north London) as the most promising initial sites among 12 proposed locations across England. Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce these plans, emphasizing a vision of "patriotic national renewal" and taking lessons from post-war Labour housing booms. Each new town will feature at least 10,000 homes, with a recommendation for 40% to be affordable, supported by a new unit to secure funding for essential services.</p>

          <p>Fading West, a modular homebuilder, is offering a potential solution to America's pervasive housing affordability crisis, aiming to restore the American Dream of home ownership. The company constructs 10-ton houses in about seven days inside its factory, utilizing lean manufacturing principles to reduce costs by up to 20% and deliver homes in half the time compared to traditional methods. This innovative approach, previously used for disaster relief in Maui, addresses critical issues like labor shortages, weather delays, and waste reduction. While modular construction currently represents a small fraction of the housing market, its benefits—including sustainability, speed, and affordability—are gaining recognition, with states like New York exploring it to boost housing supply statewide.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain and protect jobs following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. The cyber-attack, claimed by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, has cost JLR an estimated £50 million per week and severely impacted its 700 suppliers, many of which are small businesses facing financial collapse. Business Secretary Peter Kyle and Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized the loan's role in safeguarding the vital British automotive industry. While welcomed, opposition parties criticized the government's slow response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California faces a widely acknowledged housing shortage, but the exact scale of the problem remains elusive, with estimates ranging from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article explains that the discrepancies arise from varying methodologies, including target vacancy rates, calculations of "pent-up demand," and definitions of "affordable housing." Researchers also grapple with messy data and the localized nature of housing markets. Despite the differing figures, a consensus exists that the shortage is substantial, prompting lawmakers to pass sweeping changes to housing law. Experts suggest focusing on the overall magnitude of the problem rather than a single precise number to guide policy.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, who relentlessly spread baseless claims of election rigging in 2020. The lawsuit, stemming from Giuliani's allegations that Dominion systems manipulated votes, was a significant part of his efforts to cast doubt on the 2020 election results, undermining public confidence in U.S. elections. This settlement follows similar agreements by Fox News and Newsmax with Dominion. The legal and financial setbacks have been substantial for Giuliani, including disbarment and previous orders to pay millions to defamed election workers, highlighting the severe consequences of spreading election conspiracy theories.</p>
