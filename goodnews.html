          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to the airwaves after his show was suspended by ABC for nearly a week. The suspension followed controversial monologue comments regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Outside the Hollywood studio, both protesters calling for a longer suspension and supporters welcoming his return gathered, reflecting the polarized public reaction. The show's return was highly anticipated, as it marked Kimmel's first public address on the matter, while some major affiliate station owners planned to preempt the broadcast.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admitted he was "a little bit" surprised by President Trump's sudden shift in position regarding the war with Russia. After meeting with Zelenskyy at the UN, Trump posted on social media that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," calling the Russian military a "paper tiger." This statement marks a significant reversal from Trump's previous suggestions that a peace deal would likely involve Ukraine ceding some territory to Russia. Zelenskyy viewed the change as a positive development in their relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service announced it has disrupted a massive, illegal telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a significant threat to city infrastructure and the UN General Assembly. Investigators seized over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards from multiple locations, a setup powerful enough to disable cell towers or launch denial-of-service attacks. The network was reportedly used for encrypted communications by foreign governments, drug cartels, and organized crime rings. While the immediate threat has been neutralized, the investigation into those behind the well-funded operation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Despite moving away from a command economy, China has continued to use five-year plans as a central pillar of its macroeconomic policy for over seven decades. Since the first plan was implemented in 1953, these strategic blueprints have guided the nation's transformation from a country with limited industrial capacity into a global manufacturing powerhouse known as the "world's factory." Beijing is now using this framework to pursue its next goal: moving up the value chain to become a global leader in innovation and cutting-edge technology, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to be crucial to this process.</p>

          <p>In a major shift in his foreign policy stance, President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" from Russia. The statement, made on his Truth Social platform following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a stark reversal from his previous position that Ukraine would likely need to cede territory to achieve peace. Trump attributed his change in perspective to a new understanding of the economic pressure on Russia, which he labeled a "paper tiger," and urged Ukraine to act with the support of Europe.</p>

          <p>Health experts and medical agencies from around the world are pushing back against the Trump administration's announcement linking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, to autism. Organizations including the European Medicines Agency, the UK's regulatory body, and Australian health officials have issued statements affirming there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support such a claim. They reiterated that paracetamol remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women, calling the administration's claims misinformation that could cause undue alarm.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Chelsea forward Tyrique George is making the most of a second chance at the club after a £22 million summer transfer to Fulham collapsed on deadline day. Handed a lifeline, George delivered a starring performance in a Carabao Cup match, scoring a crucial equalizing goal while playing out of position as a lone striker. The academy graduate's recent success provides manager Enzo Maresca with a welcome attacking option and highlights a story of dedication, as George has bucked the trend of young Chelsea players being sold after loan spells.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Oregon believe they have made a significant breakthrough in the state's oldest cold case, the 1946 dismemberment of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe." Oregon state police have located what they believe are her remains under a headstone in a cemetery marked "Unknown Woman 1946." The woman's body parts were found in burlap sacks along the Willamette River nearly 80 years ago, but the case went cold and critical evidence was lost. The located remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing in the hope of finally restoring the victim's name and identity.</p>

          <p>A bill designed to lower the volume of loud commercials on streaming services has passed the California Legislature and now awaits the governor's signature. If signed into law, SB 576 would prohibit platforms like Hulu, Netflix, and Prime Video from playing advertisements at a volume significantly louder than the shows and movies they accompany. The legislation is modeled after the federal CALM Act, which already applies to broadcast and cable television. Industry groups, initially opposed, adopted a neutral stance after an amendment was added to prevent individuals from suing the streaming services directly for violations.</p>
