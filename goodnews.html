          <p>The Navy has restored the retired rank of Rear Admiral to Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, reversing a 2022 demotion. The decision follows a review of applicable reports and references, according to a letter from Navy Secretary John Phelan. Jackson had been retroactively demoted after an investigation found he made inappropriate comments, violated alcohol policy, and took sleeping medication. Jackson denied the allegations, claiming a political hit job. The decision to restore Jackson's rank coincides with increasing consideration for Trump supporters within the Pentagon.</p>

The artwork, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was found in good condition after being missing since 1945. The painting was spotted in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata by Dutch journalists researching Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien. Kadgien's daughter unknowingly uploaded the listing, leading to the painting's discovery. Patricia Kagdien and her husband are under house arrest pending a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was illegal. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the administration's actions were a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on the university, imposed in retaliation for Harvard's refusal to capitulate to demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars the Trump administration from enforcing them. The projects affected by the freeze include research on tuberculosis, NASA astronauts' radiation exposure, Lou Gehrig's disease, and a predictive model to help VA emergency room physicians decide whether suicidal veterans should be hospitalized.</p>

Nio's CEO William Li aims to deliver 50,000 EVs monthly in the fourth quarter to reach the break-even target. Analysts note that publicly listed EV makers need to cut losses as it is difficult to raise fresh funds amid overcapacity concerns.</p>

The company is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products and slower growth in its expiration base. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, it hasn't been lifted by the artificial intelligence boom in the same way as many of its tech peers. On Wednesday Salesforce announced a $20 billion increase to its share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion. (not investment advice)</p>
