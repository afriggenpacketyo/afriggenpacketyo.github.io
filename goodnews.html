          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully coercing them into adhering to Trump's immigration policies. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress for transportation projects. This ruling follows several executive orders aimed at cutting off federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. </p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Researchers found that local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced plastic bag litter collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. Fee-based policies were found to be more effective than partial bans. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights the importance of well-designed policies with fewer loopholes. </p>

The movie has a dull central plot, but it is beefed up by unusual ambition, quirky side characters and maniacal editing. The film shifts alliances without taking sides, and it is a comment on human progress. The reviewer states that it is a given that humans will eventually, stubbornly, relentlessly find a way to tear other humans to pieces, as we do in every movie, and just as we‚Äôve done since the first homo sapien went after his rival with a stick. </p>
