        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant development, Israel's Prime Minister has reportedly ordered a halt to all offensive military operations in Gaza, permitting only defensive measures. This directive comes as Hamas expressed willingness to release all hostages under a U.S.-proposed ceasefire plan, a stance also supported by other Palestinian militant groups. While the Israeli military continues to warn residents against returning to northern Gaza, which it still considers a dangerous combat zone, a negotiating team is being prepared for upcoming talks. The primary focus for Israel is securing the swift and safe return of all hostages, signaling a potential shift towards de-escalation in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>England's world champion full-back, Ellie Kildunne, has stated she is open to considering opportunities with the proposed new R360 rugby league but remains focused on her current season with Harlequins. Amid reports that she is a top target for the breakaway league and that many of her England teammates have already signed pre-contract agreements, Kildunne emphasized that she needs more information before making any decisions. The discussion highlights the significant investment and changes coming to women's rugby following the Red Roses' World Cup victory, which is creating new professional pathways and talking points for players.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes the theory that Venice's famous bronze statue, the Lion of St Mark, may have originated in Tang dynasty China as a mythical tomb guardian. This conclusion is based on stylistic similarities and lead isotope testing that traces the copper to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers suggest a tantalizing possibility for its journey to Europe: that it was transported by Niccolò and Maffeo Polo, the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo. The theory challenges the long-held beliefs about the origins of one of Venice's most important symbols.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an extraordinary endurance project, climbing the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just over a month. The project, titled "States of Elevation," involved him cycling more than 3,000 miles between mountain ranges and then running up each peak, showcasing his unique blend of athleticism and artistry. Jornet emphasized that his motivation was not about setting records but about exploring new landscapes and creating what he calls "the most aesthetic line" through the American wilderness, driven by a deep connection to the mountains.</p>

          <p>This article reveals several surprising details about the Nobel Prize's history, highlighting both its celebrated and controversial moments. It notes the Curie family's dynasty of five prizes, Albert Einstein's divorce settlement involving his prize money, and the fact he was awarded for the photoelectric effect, not his more famous theory of relativity. The piece also delves into controversies, such as the omission of a mathematics prize, the overlooking of key female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, and awards given for since-debunked or harmful scientific discoveries like the lobotomy.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a former Economic Security Minister, as its new leader, setting her up to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, one of the party's most conservative members, won an intraparty vote by defeating Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff. Her election comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after significant election losses and faces pressing diplomatic challenges, including a potential summit with the U.S. president. Her confirmation by parliament is expected in mid-October.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi is set to become Japan's first female prime minister after being elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe and a staunch conservative, she is known for her hawkish security views, support for "Abenomics," and regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni shrine. She also opposes progressive social policies like same-sex marriage and allowing women to keep their maiden names. Analysts suggest that while her hardline stance may appeal to the party's right-wing base, it could alienate more moderate voters, posing a challenge to unifying the party.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. This event will be the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its perigee, or closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon, the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, is notably late, being the latest since 1987.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's pragmatic and unorthodox diplomatic style has been crucial in advancing a potential peace deal in Gaza. After Hamas responded to his 20-point plan with a conditional acceptance, Trump chose to interpret it as a full agreement and publicly called on Israel to immediately halt its bombing campaign. This move, which reportedly surprised the Israeli government, has cornered Prime Minister Netanyahu and created significant momentum for a ceasefire. The action is seen as driven by Trump's desire for a diplomatic victory and to further his Abraham Accords.</p>
