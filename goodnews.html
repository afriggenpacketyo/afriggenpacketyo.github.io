Spirovski created the work by painting with her fingers, as a nerve injury had made it painful for her to hold a brush. She expressed her joy and gratitude, stating the experience was a "beautiful reprieve" after a difficult period. The award-winning portrait was created while listening to Barton's music, which inspired her to use her hands directly, making the process almost painless and creatively fulfilling.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in California, but the pilot was able to eject safely before the impact. Officials confirmed the incident occurred on Wednesday evening and that no other personnel were harmed. The crash of the jet, which was attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron, sparked a small grass fire that was subsequently contained by Cal Fire. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by naval authorities. The safe ejection of the pilot is a significant positive outcome in an otherwise serious incident.</p>

The new office will be responsible for partnerships not only in New Zealand but also with several Pacific Island nations. New Zealand officials welcomed the enhanced cooperation, noting it sends a clear message to criminals and strengthens collaboration on issues like counter-terrorism and transnational organized crime.</p>

While Washington and Seoul appear to have different interpretations of how the investment funds will be controlled, the deal is seen as a success in South Korea.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The legislation allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill, AB 379, was controversial, with some Democrats initially raising concerns that it could be used to profile minorities or harm victims. A compromise was reached to add the three-year age gap provision to target older offenders specifically. The law also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, though she loves her home state. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. A source close to Harris indicated that she wants to have an impact on the national stage and that not running for governor keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential bid.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, several contending teams made significant moves to strengthen their bullpens. The Philadelphia Phillies made a major splash by acquiring hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins.

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which they claim would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company argues their proposal offers reduced risk and would prevent spiraling costs, estimating a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the airport's expansion, introducing a new dynamic to the long-debated infrastructure project.</p>

The growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher equity and cryptocurrency valuations, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused a moment of concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning accompanied by a trainer. The team later announced the issue was only cramping, alleviating fears of a more serious injury. Ohtani, who was pitching on a hot and humid night, remained in the game as the designated hitter. Despite the positive news on Ohtani's health, the Dodgers went on to lose the game 5-2. The two-way star is expected to make his next scheduled start.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered Pacific-wide alerts, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are formed and what to do if one occurs. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, at least magnitude 6.5 to 7, that causes vertical movement of the sea floor. While challenging to predict accurately, scientists use tide gauges and deep ocean pressure sensors to forecast their path and potential impact. For safety, officials advise moving immediately to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—upon receiving a warning, as the waves can travel at jet-speed and are extremely powerful.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, the team observed an amazing abundance of creatures, including beds of clams, mats of bacteria, and fields of tube worms, in a pitch-black, high-pressure environment. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest that such "chemosynthetic" ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>
