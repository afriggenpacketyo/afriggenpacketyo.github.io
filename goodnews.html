        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record $6.1 billion, making it the largest ever sale of an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially own over 51% of the team, with full control expected by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. This acquisition surpasses previous records for NFL and NBA team sales, highlighting the escalating value of major sports franchises and the significant investment appeal of professional sports. The previous ownership group, which bought the team for $360 million in 2002, oversaw two NBA championships, including their 18th title, a league record. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has definitively ruled that Pinkfong's globally popular children's song "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize US composer Jonathan Wright's version, concluding a six-year legal dispute. The court upheld previous verdicts, asserting that Wright's 2011 rendition of the public domain folk song lacked "substantial alteration" to merit independent copyright protection. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation soared to viral fame on YouTube, becoming the most-viewed video and inspiring numerous international adaptations. This article clarifies the legal precedent regarding copyright protection for derivative works based on traditional folk songs, confirming the widespread hit's originality in its arrangement.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive explanation of BTecs, which are practical qualifications equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2) or A-levels (Level 3), assessed through a combination of coursework, exams, and projects. It details their specific grading scale, ranging from Starred Distinction to Pass, and highlights their significance as a pathway for students entering either direct employment or higher education. The article also addresses recent policy shifts in the UK, noting that the Labour government has paused plans to withdraw funding from many BTecs, ensuring continued support for key courses in vital sectors like health, engineering, and agriculture until at least 2026.</p>
