          <p>Lady Gaga performed a free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, drawing over two million attendees and revitalizing the local economy with an expected $100 million boost. The performance was part of a promotional tour for her eighth album, Mayhem, and marked her return to Brazil after a 10-year absence. The city-funded event included a significant security presence, featuring 5,000 police officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras. Gaga, visibly emotional, expressed her gratitude to her Brazilian fans and showcased Brazil-themed costumes, performing hits like Alejandro, Poker Face, and Bad Romance. Fans traveled from across the country, with some queuing early in the morning to secure a spot for the "unforgettable show".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a "commercial transaction" that undermines EU citizenship. The court argued that citizenship requires a genuine link with the country, not just financial investment, and that these schemes pose risks to mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the program's economic benefits, the court's decision highlights the importance of solidarity and shared values within the EU. The ruling may prompt increased scrutiny of "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for investments but raise similar concerns about security and corruption.</p>

          <p>Voters in South Texas approved the incorporation of Starbase, the location of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility, as an official city. The vote, heavily favored by SpaceX employees, formalizes the area as a municipality, a move celebrated by Musk on his social platform X. The new city raises concerns among critics who fear it will expand Musk's control over the area, potentially impacting public access to a popular beach and state park. SpaceX seeks to increase the number of launches from the site, and companion bills in the state Legislature aim to shift beach closure authority to the new city.</p>
