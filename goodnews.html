This action comes after the University of Tokyo expressed interest in accommodating affected international students. Education Minister Toshiko Abe emphasized the commitment to ensuring educational opportunities for ambitious young individuals. The ministry will also offer consultation services through the Japan Student Services Organization for students studying in the United States, with 110 Japanese students and 150 researchers currently enrolled at Harvard.</p>

          <p>Korean Air, Jeju Air, and T‚Äôway Air have been collectively fined US$2.6 million by the South Korean government for violating the Aviation Safety Act.

In addition to the fines, the government suspended the licenses of eight aviation maintenance engineers from the three airlines for periods ranging from 15 to 45 days.

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are experiencing a second day of decline due to concerns about a potential price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell sharply after the company announced price cuts on numerous electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly investigating the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, which are then resold as secondhand vehicles. Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margins to be under pressure in the short term due to the price reductions, but anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po highlighted the immense value of data and China's digital economy delivering over US$4.8 trillion in revenue last year. The government's open data portal offers more than 5,600 data sets and recorded over 60 billion downloads in 2024.
