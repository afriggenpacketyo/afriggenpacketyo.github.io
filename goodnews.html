          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on the 17th stage. The anticipated bunch finish occurred despite heavy rain in the final 30 kilometers, which caused a crash involving some of Milan's key rivals. This victory strengthens Milan's hold on the green jersey for the points classification leader, extending his lead over Tadej Pogacar, who continues to hold the overall race lead in the yellow jersey. Milan expressed satisfaction with his performance but noted that challenging mountain stages still lie ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark decision, the International Court of Justice has affirmed that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including historical greenhouse gas emissions. The non-binding ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying Pacific islands that initiated the case out of frustration with global inaction. The UN court stated that failing to develop ambitious climate plans could breach the Paris Agreement and that countries have a right to seek compensation for climate-related damages. This decision could pave the way for legal claims against historically high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United States and Japan will establish a 15% tariff rate on Japanese products, avoiding a potential 25% rate that was set to take effect. The deal specifically lowers the tariff on Japanese cars to 15%, a significant concession for Japan's vital auto industry, which accounts for over a third of its exports to the U.S. In return, Japan has agreed to open its markets to American trucks, rice, and other agricultural goods. Additionally, the agreement includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts Debate Impact of Potential Capital Gains Tax Cut on Housing Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:58:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are divided on whether eliminating the capital gains tax on home sales, a proposal floated by President Trump, would significantly impact the housing market. The National Association of Realtors argues it would unlock inventory, as many homeowners, particularly retirees looking to downsize, are deterred from selling by the tax. However, other analysts believe the primary issue holding back the market is a lack of confidence and stability, not the tax, which primarily affects higher-end homeowners and those with substantial long-term gains. Currently, profits over $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples are taxed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding How Minimum Payments on Credit Card Balances Are Calculated</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:54:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation and high interest rates straining budgets, many consumers carry a credit card balance, making it crucial to understand how minimum payments are determined. Issuers typically calculate this amount using one of several methods, such as a flat percentage of the balance (often 1-3%) or a formula combining 1% of the balance with accrued interest and fees. For a $2,000 balance at 22% APR, a minimum payment could range from $40 to nearly $60. While making the minimum payment keeps an account in good standing, it is an expensive long-term strategy due to compounding interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new feature in the U.S. that will allow women drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other, aiming to enhance safety and comfort on the platform. The tool, which will be piloted in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit next month, lets women passengers request women drivers and allows women drivers to opt-in to only receive requests from women. While a match is not guaranteed, the company states it increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman pairing. This initiative expands on a similar feature Uber has successfully tested in approximately 40 other countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer advertisement after ruling that the featured model appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog found that the model's pose and the styling, including large pointed shoes that emphasized the slenderness of her legs, made the ad irresponsible. M&S has since stopped using the image but defended its practices, stating it promotes inclusive fashion and ensures all its models are in good health. The ruling requires the retailer to ensure future images do not portray models in a way that suggests an unhealthy body weight.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners unable to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), financial experts recommend first asking the lender for the specific reasons for the denial. Common obstacles include high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score, with lenders tightening standards amid higher interest rates. To improve approval odds, borrowers should focus on reducing debt, improving their credit score, and ensuring their finances are in order before reapplying. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like a fixed-rate home equity loan, a cash-out refinance, or a personal loan may be viable options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials made the convictions "unsafe." The men, who were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US, have long maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. This landmark judgment vindicates their fight and could pave the way for other convicted traders to have their cases reviewed.</p>

          <p>Toy and gaming company Hasbro reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strength of its digital gaming division. Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment, which includes popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16%. This performance helped offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which was negatively impacted by tariffs and changes in retailer order timing. Despite the beat, the company reported a net loss of $855.8 million, primarily due to a $1 billion goodwill impairment. (not investment advice)</p>
