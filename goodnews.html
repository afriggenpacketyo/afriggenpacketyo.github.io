          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 08:28:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, including the difficult essay-based Level III. Researchers from NYU and GoodFin tested 23 large language models, finding that top-tier AIs could pass mock exams in minutes, a task that typically requires humans thousands of hours of study. While this showcases the rapid evolution of AI's analytical reasoning in finance, experts believe the technology will transform the industry rather than completely replace human analysts, who excel at understanding human context and intent.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, which brought powerful winds and rain to southern China, appears to have caused less damage than initially feared in Guangdong province. While cities like Shenzhen reported high wind speeds and some areas experienced power outages, the storm weakened as it made landfall and major cities began lifting restrictions by the evening. Unlike 2018's destructive Super Typhoon Mangkhut, authorities in Shenzhen reported no injuries and that the city was operating smoothly. The storm had previously caused fatalities in Taiwan and the Philippines before reaching mainland China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is striving to become a leader in autonomous driving technology, but faces challenges including high car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system. While driverless vehicle projects are being tested in several cities, progress is slow compared to the U.S. and China, partly due to German manufacturers' caution about releasing immature systems. One initiative, NeMo Paderborn, is developing a "swarm" of lightweight autonomous cabs for rural and last-mile transport, aiming for a commercial rollout by 2026. Experts argue that for the technology to succeed, it must be integrated into public transit rather than just replacing private cars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book "Psychobabble," licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses harmful mental health misconceptions that have spread online due to the overuse of "therapy-speak." Nucci argues that terms like "people pleaser" and "love bombing" are often misapplied, and diagnoses should inform treatment rather than define a person's entire identity. He cautions against the belief that therapy alone can make someone "ready" for a relationship, emphasizing that real-world experience is irreplaceable. The article highlights the importance of nuance and warns that over-analyzing and self-diagnosing through social media can be counterproductive to genuine mental healing.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have erased a 10-game deficit in less than a month to tie the Detroit Tigers for first place in the American League Central division. Cleveland secured a 5-2 victory over Detroit, fueled by a strong pitching performance from Gavin Williams who recorded 12 strikeouts. The Tigers, who had led the division since April, are in the midst of a significant collapse, having lost seven consecutive games. The Guardians' surge, combined with the Tigers' downturn, has set up a dramatic conclusion to the division race with just a few games left in the season.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a man in connection with a major cyber-attack that has caused significant disruption at several European airports, including Heathrow. The attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company that provides essential baggage and check-in software for numerous airlines. The system failure led to hundreds of flight delays and forced staff to use manual methods like pen and paper for boarding. While the arrest is a significant step, the investigation is ongoing, and airports are being advised to prepare for at least another week of manual workarounds as the software is rebuilt.</p>

          <p>Global defense company stocks surged after U.S. President Donald Trump made a significant policy shift, stating that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. This contrasts with his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to concede land for peace. European defense firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab saw their share prices climb over 3%. The move, articulated on his Truth Social platform, was attributed to a new understanding of the military and economic situation, with Trump describing Russia as a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble.

          <p>A Standard Chartered survey of 1,200 senior executives reveals that a majority of multinational companies expect costs to rise due to geopolitical instability. In response, firms are accelerating their adoption of artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing to improve efficiency and offset financial pressures. Approximately 62% of respondents anticipate cost increases of 5% to 14% over the next five years, with concerns being particularly high among companies in the ASEAN region. The survey highlights that technological innovation has become as critical as trade tariffs and economic trends in shaping global supply chain strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As clear favorites to win the Women's Rugby World Cup on home soil, England's team is focused on managing the high expectations and "ignoring the noise." The Red Roses are on a 32-match winning streak and face Canada in the final, a team they have defeated in their last 13 meetings. Experts and team insiders, including defense coach Sarah Hunter who captained the team in the 2022 final loss, emphasize the importance of staying relaxed and trusting their process. The team's professional setup and a narrative focused on "unfinished business" rather than past failures are key elements in their strategy to secure the world title.</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that runs in families. A new one-time gene therapy treatment, delivered via brain surgery, has been shown to slow the disease's clinical progression by an average of 75% in a trial involving 29 patients. The therapy works by reducing levels of the toxic protein that kills brain cells. The results have been described as "spectacular" by the research team at University College London, offering profound hope to patients and families by potentially adding decades of quality life and even preventing symptoms if administered early.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has stated that the league could begin renegotiating its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, well before the current agreement's 2029 opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion deal is with partners like Disney, Comcast, Paramount, and Amazon. An earlier renegotiation could add billions more to the league's revenue and allow media companies to secure the highly valuable rights for an extended period. Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape as a reason for seeking flexibility, a move that could significantly impact team valuations and player salary caps. (not investment advice)</p>
