          <p>Following the dismissal of head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest is reportedly advancing its efforts to hire Ange Postecoglou as his replacement. Sources indicate that the 60-year-old Postecoglou is a strong candidate for the position at the City Ground. Initial contact is understood to have been made between the club and Postecoglou's representatives. There is a growing sense that an agreement is possible to bring the experienced manager to the Premier League club as it seeks new leadership.</p>

Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled against breaking up Google, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a significant factor that has fundamentally altered the search engine market. Although the court found Google illegally monopolized the search market, Judge Amit Mehta decided against forcing the sale of its Chrome browser. The judge's opinion noted that AI-powered chatbots from competitors like OpenAI and others represent a new reality and a potential game-changer, creating a more competitive landscape than existed when the case began in 2020. Google will instead face lesser penalties, including sharing some data with rivals.</p>

South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slid. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose, but mainland China's CSI 300 slipped. Meanwhile, Indonesian markets fell sharply after the unexpected dismissal of the country's highly respected finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-running succession dispute within the Murdoch media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. Under the deal, his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of the trust controlling the companies, receiving approximately $1.1 billion each. This resolution ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue under Lachlan after his father, Rupert Murdoch, passes away. The agreement ends all litigation over the family trust, resolving years of internal tension.</p>
