          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, more than doubling the previous year's figure and significantly beating analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit, which capitalized on high market volatility. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients maintain a 'wait-and-see' attitude, and the bank continues to navigate challenges, including proposed Swiss capital rules that could require an additional $26 billion in core capital. The integration of Credit Suisse remains on track, with $1 billion in share buybacks completed this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting of the party's elite Central Committee comes amid ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions with the United States. President Xi Jinping has emphasized the importance of the new blueprint, which will be finalized and endorsed by the national legislature in March.

          <h2>California Coastal Residents React to Tsunami Advisory with Mix of Concern and Calm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 01:36:39 EDT</div>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia, residents along the California coast responded to tsunami advisories with a blend of caution, curiosity, and nonchalance. In Southern California, where only small waves were expected, many beachgoers were undisturbed, while some expressed surprise and considered their lack of an emergency plan. In Crescent City, a Northern California town historically vulnerable to tsunamis, locals in a pub remained calm, accustomed to such alerts. The varied reactions highlight the different levels of perceived risk along the coast, with many continuing their day while staying aware of the situation.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje has solidified his legacy by captaining the British and Irish Lions to a series win, joining a prestigious and small group of victorious leaders that includes legends like Willie John McBride and Martin Johnson. The accomplishment is considered one of the highest honors in rugby, particularly when achieved in the southern hemisphere. Itoje, known for his thoughtful leadership and on-field dominance, reflected on the unique challenge of uniting players from four different nations to achieve a common goal. Now recognized as one of the greats, his focus turns to completing a 3-0 series sweep in the final match against the Wallabies.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests UK's FTSE-100 Index Performance is Not a Reliable Indicator of Domestic Economic Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 01:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 stock index reaching all-time highs and outperforming many global benchmarks this year, its success is not necessarily reflective of the UK's domestic economy. A CNBC analysis points out that the index is heavily weighted with multinational corporations that derive the vast majority of their earnings overseas, such as in energy, mining, and defense. Consequently, the Footsie's performance is more influenced by global factors, a weaker pound, and international market dynamics than by the health of UK-focused businesses. This contrasts with the index's composition at its 1984 launch, when it was dominated by domestically oriented companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6 million settlement with Jewish students and a professor who sued the university over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The lawsuit argued that UCLA violated their civil rights by allowing protesters to block access to classes and other campus areas, creating a hostile environment. This settlement follows a preliminary injunction and a finding by the U.S. Department of Justice that the university had acted with "deliberate indifference." As part of the agreement, UCLA must ensure equal campus access for all, with the funds covering damages, legal fees, and donations to antisemitism-focused organizations.</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have used bristle-like structures for "social distancing" to enhance its survival. The 436-million-year-old brachiopod fossils, found in China's Guizhou province, were arranged in a highly regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the former sea floor. Researchers believe the extinct species, Nucleospira calypta, used hundreds of flexible setae, each thinner than a human hair, to maintain optimal spacing from its neighbors. This behavior likely helped ensure each individual had adequate room for filter feeding, demonstrating a sophisticated survival strategy among early marine life.</p>

The contract value is substantial, surpassing the company's entire revenue for the second quarter of this year. This agreement underscores the growing demand for battery components as the electric vehicle market expands and comes as LG Energy Solution continues to increase its manufacturing presence in the United States.

Despite dodging a technical recession and posting solid 4.3% year-over-year GDP growth in the second quarter, the MAS signaled it remains ready to adjust its policy. The U.S. has reportedly been "non-committal" on whether Singapore will be exempt from broader tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and falling below economists' expectations. This places inflation near the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2%-3% target range. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which partially offset price increases in housing and food. The softer inflation figures provide strong evidence for the RBA to consider another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting, especially given a weaker global growth outlook and a recent rise in the domestic unemployment rate.

The change was prompted by the country's internet regulator, which highlighted that YouTube was the most frequently cited platform where minors encountered harmful content. YouTube has protested the decision, arguing it is a video-sharing platform, not social media, and that the move could set up a new dispute with parent company Alphabet.</p>
