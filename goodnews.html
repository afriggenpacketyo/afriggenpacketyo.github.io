          <p>The Trump administration is delaying the ban on TikTok for the third time, granting a 90-day extension. This decision follows President Trump's meeting with advisors in the Situation Room after his early departure from a summit with Group of Seven leaders, which was prompted by escalating tensions in the Middle East. Trump's national security team has presented him with various options concerning Iran, including the potential deployment of American military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are revising the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to allocate funds for President Trump's domestic agenda after it was narrowly passed by the House last month. Optimism around international affairs and domestic policy developments could be seen as cautiously optimistic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temperatures in the UK have surpassed 29C, signaling the approach of the first heatwave of the year, with potentially higher temperatures expected through the week. Yellow heat-health alerts are in effect for most of England until Sunday evening, indicating an increased risk to vulnerable populations. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where parts of France and Spain could reach near 40C. A recent study suggests a rapidly increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK, potentially within the next 12 years due to climate change, indicating the growing challenges posed by rising global temperatures.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at their current level, between 4.25% and 4.5%, amid expectations of elevated inflation and moderate economic growth. Despite holding steady, the Fed's "dot plot" indicates that two rate cuts are still anticipated by the end of 2025, though fewer cuts are expected in subsequent years. Economic projections suggest continued stagflationary pressures, with GDP growth forecasted at 1.4% in 2025 and inflation at 3%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's position to await further economic clarity before making any policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

A previous trial in July 2024 ended in a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict.
