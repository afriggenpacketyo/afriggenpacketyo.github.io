          <h2>Global Economic Growth Forecast Upgraded by IMF Due to Softened US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:57:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its global economic growth forecast for 2025 and 2026, partly attributing the improvement to a softening of US tariffs. This upgrade, reflecting a surge in US imports as firms anticipated higher taxes, projects global growth at 3% and 3.1% respectively. The IMF, however, cautions that future higher tariffs and increased uncertainty could still impede economic activity. The article notes the UK is expected to be among the fastest-growing advanced economies.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase, already the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to assume the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Sources familiar with the negotiations indicate that other contenders like American Express and Synchrony have been bypassed. This potential shift would mark a significant change for the Apple Card, which has been exclusively issued by Goldman Sachs since its launch. The article notes that both banks declined to comment, and Apple did not immediately respond.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rumors circulating online that legendary Genesis frontman Phil Collins was in hospice care have been dismissed by his representative. The 74-year-old musician is instead recovering from recent knee surgery. Collins has previously spoken about ongoing health issues, including nerve damage from a spinal injury in 2007 that prevents him from playing drums. Despite these challenges, his representative clarified that speculation about terminal illness is entirely inaccurate, reassuring fans about his current health status.</p>

          <p>Boeing significantly cut its quarterly losses and saw a jump in sales, delivering the most airplanes since 2018, signaling improvement after years of crises. CEO Kelly Ortberg stated 2025 could be a "turnaround year" focusing on safety, quality, and stability. The aerospace giant lost $176 million, down from $1.09 billion a year prior, with revenue rising 35%. Despite a $445 million charge from a Justice Department deal, commercial airplane unit sales surged. Challenges remain, including delayed certification for 737 Max variants and potential labor strikes.</p>

          <p>As many Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts mature this year, experts advise savers to actively review their options rather than allowing auto-renewal. With CD rates having slightly dropped from last year but still historically high, consumers should compare current rates at various institutions and consider alternative options like high-yield savings accounts or other investments. The article emphasizes that locking in a guaranteed return now might be wise, especially with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon. Proactive comparison is key to maximizing savings.

          <p>New DNA analysis of skeletons from Catalhoyuk, a Neolithic settlement in Turkey, suggests that its society 9,000 years ago was centered around women, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved into their female partners' families. This finding, published in Science, was supported by genetic links among individuals buried under the same houses and a higher number of grave goods found with female remains. Researchers also noted evidence of child-swapping between families, possibly to ensure equal resource distribution, pointing to a society that valued equality.</p>
