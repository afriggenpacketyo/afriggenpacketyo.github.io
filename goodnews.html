          <p>In a dramatic cricket match in The Hundred, Southern Brave clinched a one-wicket victory against Manchester Originals with just one ball remaining. Chasing a target of 132, the Brave seemed destined for defeat, needing 26 runs from the last 11 balls with only two wickets in hand. However, a late-game surge from tailenders Craig Overton and Tymal Mills turned the tide unexpectedly. The thrilling conclusion came when Reece Topley, the last batsman, hit a four on his first ball to secure the win.</p>

This diplomatic activity unfolds as a US-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, with the administration stating that secondary sanctions on Russia's partners remain a possibility.

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, has been released from custody after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped a felony weapons possession charge against him. The "Crank That" artist was arrested after police found a firearm in a vehicle he was a passenger in. The D.A.'s office declined to pursue the case due to insufficient evidence, as both the rapper and the driver denied ownership of the weapon.

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, a look back reveals how the storm acted as an unlikely catalyst for desperately needed reforms in the city's public defender system. Before the hurricane, the system was already broken, and the storm's aftermath caused a total collapse of the courts, leaving incarcerated people in limbo. However, the destruction also cleared the way for fundamental changes that had been resisted for decades. This article revisits the crisis and finds a system that, born from catastrophe, has been vastly improved over the past 20 years.</p>

          <p>Zoox, the self-driving vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, has received a key regulatory exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), paving the way for demonstrations of its robotaxis. This is the first time a US-built vehicle has been granted such an exemption, which frees it from certain federal safety standards designed for human-driven cars. As part of the decision, the NHTSA is also closing a safety probe into Zoox's self-certification of its purpose-built vehicle. The company plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service, with Las Vegas eyed as its first market.</p>
