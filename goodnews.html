          <p>Sovereignty won the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, defeating Journalism in a rematch of the Kentucky Derby.

Sovereignty skipped the Preakness Stakes to focus on the Belmont, while Journalism was the only horse to compete in all three Triple Crown races, having won the Preakness.</p>

          <p>Inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines have led to passenger frustration and calls for clearer regulations. The EU is considering standardizing sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines to address confusion and unexpected fees. The EU transport ministers proposed that passengers should be guaranteed one free personal item. Consumer groups argue that the proposals don't go far enough, as airlines could still charge for overhead cabin bags.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried feces from healthy donors to combat drug-resistant superbug infections. Early data suggests that these pills can replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, potentially eliminating superbugs. The focus is on the bowels, which are a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance. This approach aims to prevent superbugs from escaping the gut and causing infections elsewhere in the body, offering a new strategy to tackle antibiotic-resistant infections.</p>
