          <p>China has passed a new law designed to bolster the private economy, providing legal recourse for businesses. The Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, aims to protect firms from arbitrary fines and administrative intervention. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely monitoring the law's implementation to determine its effectiveness in curbing administrative powers and ensuring fair treatment in legal disputes. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. The ruling from Judge Beryl Howell permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients or causes that Trump dislikes. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession. The article notes that other firms have challenged similar orders, while some have made deals with the president to avoid such actions.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a replacement of the existing holiday. The clarification came after Trump initially stated his intention to designate November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" and May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing federal holidays requires congressional approval.</p>
