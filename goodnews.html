        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling just 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from July's 2.6% decline. This marks the fourth consecutive month of negative growth but was buoyed by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the United States continued to fall sharply, particularly in the automotive sector, amidst ongoing trade tensions and political uncertainty in Japan. The data comes just ahead of a Bank of Japan meeting where interest rates are expected to be held steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appreciation of Robert Redford, who passed away at 89, celebrates his career as one defined by a deliberate avoidance of simple, heroic roles in favor of more complex and challenging characters. Despite his classic Hollywood looks, Redford consistently chose parts that questioned American ideals, such as in "The Candidate" and "The Great Gatsby." He is remembered not just for iconic films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" but also for his commitment to artistic integrity, which included founding the Sundance Institute to support independent filmmakers and shaping a legacy of thoughtful, introspective cinema.</p>

          <h2>Boeing's YC-14 Prototype Mastered Short Runways with Unique Over-Wing Engines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 19:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits the Boeing YC-14, a prototype military transport aircraft from the 1970s designed for short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. Its most distinctive feature was its massive over-wing engines, which utilized a concept called upper-surface blowing. This design directed engine exhaust over the wing flaps to generate exceptional lift at low speeds, allowing the aircraft to take off and land on runways as short as 800 feet. Although the YC-14 was never mass-produced, its innovative technology demonstrated remarkable performance and contributed valuable lessons to aviation engineering.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's office has announced that five partially built, illegal homes in Laurel Canyon will be demolished, concluding a legal fight that has spanned over two decades. The structures were part of a larger development halted in 2002, and a demolition order was issued in 2003 but never carried out by a series of subsequent owners. Under a recent plea agreement with the current developers, who were facing criminal charges for attempting to restart construction, the homes must be torn down by August 2026, resolving a long-standing issue for the community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase could be the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, joining an exclusive club currently dominated by tech giants. Citing the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and global reach, Cramer highlighted its current valuation of around $850 billion, which far surpasses its peers. He noted that the entire banking sector is performing well, with both earnings and price-to-earnings multiples expanding, suggesting that JPMorgan is well-positioned for continued growth and could lead the financial sector to new heights.

          <p>New data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals a significant shift in driver preferences in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a dramatic increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely attributed to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not have manual gearboxes, and the approaching 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. As learners anticipate an electric driving future, the necessity of learning to operate a manual transmission is becoming less relevant for many.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant tactical shift under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the high-scoring approach of the previous season. The team's 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal marked their fourth clean sheet in five games, a stark contrast to their record at the same point last year. Players have highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," focusing on strong defensive structure and making the team difficult to beat. While this pragmatic style has been effective in securing results, it has come at the cost of offensive excitement, with the team managing only one shot on target in their recent win.</p>

          <p>Google's AI chatbot app, Gemini, has claimed the top spot for free applications on Apple's App Store, overtaking its primary rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT. This surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature that reportedly attracted 13 million new users in just four days. The achievement signals that Google is gaining significant ground in the consumer generative AI race, a market that has been largely dominated by ChatGPT since its launch. This increased user traction has also boosted investor confidence, contributing to parent company Alphabet's recent entry into the $3 trillion market cap club.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes that major sports teams and ownership groups are unlikely to go public despite soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly in private markets, and public companies like Madison Square Garden Sports often trade below their intrinsic value. He emphasized that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which may not align with the short-term pressures of public markets, making private equity a more suitable source of capital.
