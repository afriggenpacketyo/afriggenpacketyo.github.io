          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has responded to President Trump's executive order aimed at defunding NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. CPB emphasized its independence from the federal government, as mandated by Congress. The executive order seeks to block federal funding to NPR and PBS and prevent indirect funding through local stations. PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger warned that the loss of federal funding would disproportionately affect rural communities, potentially impacting children's programming and emergency alerts.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, effective May 20, designed to bolster the country's private economy. The law aims to provide legal recourse for private firms, particularly in disputes with local governments, and to protect them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely watching the implementation of the law to assess its effectiveness in curbing administrative powers and ensuring fair adjudication of cases against local governments. The 78-article law is the first explicitly created for this purpose.</p>

Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients or causes Trump dislikes. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>The article explores the reasons behind the increasing number of autism diagnoses, noting that while diagnoses have risen significantly, it doesn't necessarily mean there are more autistic people. Changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better recognition of autism in women and adults are contributing factors. The definition of autism has broadened over time, and more people with lower support needs are now being diagnosed. This shift has brought both positive outcomes and tensions within the autistic community.</p>
