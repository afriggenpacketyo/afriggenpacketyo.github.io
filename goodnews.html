          <h2>Debate Over Staircase Requirements Could Reshape American Cities</h2>

          <p>The article explores the debate surrounding building codes in the United States, particularly the requirement for two staircases in apartment buildings over three stories. Advocates argue that allowing single-stair buildings, common in Europe and other parts of the world, could significantly reduce construction costs and increase the availability of affordable housing. They claim that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe, while opponents, including fire safety officials, express concerns about evacuation and fire operations. The discussion highlights the potential for modernizing building codes to address the housing crisis while ensuring safety.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its first sales forecast since announcing the device's June launch. Despite a drop in fourth-quarter revenue and profit due to anticipation for the new console, Nintendo expects a significant rise in net sales for the upcoming year. However, the company is cautious about U.S. tariff rates, which could impact profits if prices need to be adjusted, potentially decreasing demand in the U.S. market. Despite these concerns, analysts believe Nintendo's forecasts are conservative, with the Switch 2 poised for a strong debut.</p>
