          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved a plan for Nippon Steel Corp. to partner with United States Steel Corp., a decision he announced via social media. According to Trump, this partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the American economy, with a significant portion of the investment expected within the next 14 months. Both steelmakers have expressed support for the decision, though the specific details of the partnership and its impact on American ownership remain unclear, the United Steelworkers union remains wary of the agreement. The deal has seen U.S. Steel's shares jump significantly following the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff size considerably. The changes involve reassignments and administrative leave, with some regional teams being dissolved or merged. Andy Baker, Vice President Vance's national security advisor, will take a top role as deputy national security advisor. Some former NSC members express concern that fewer staff will lead to less control over the bureaucracy, while others see it as streamlining the council to better align with President Trump's foreign policy objectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Global Change Biology suggests that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has significantly altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The study found that beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human-influenced food sources. Researchers analyzed museum specimens and newspaper archives to track the changes over approximately ten generations.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain the fluid, and patients may also undergo physical therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can often reverse the symptoms, but if left untreated, the condition can lead to irreversible damage.</p>
