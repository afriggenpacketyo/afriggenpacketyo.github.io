        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's proposal to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure amid declining letter volumes. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both services will be slightly relaxed. The reform to the Universal Service Obligation is intended to ensure the financial sustainability of the postal service. Ofcom emphasized that these changes are necessary for the service's survival but require effective implementation by Royal Mail to improve performance and reduce long delays.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major sanitation project. The workers were trapped several miles from the tunnel's access point and had to climb over a large pile of debris to reach safety. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, facilitated the hour-long rescue operation, which was praised by city officials.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and stable macroeconomic fundamentals. In a recent article, Sheng Songcheng noted that the yuan has shown resilience and reduced sensitivity to risk during recent global stress events, including the Russia-Ukraine war and US tariff shocks. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the yuan's internationalization, particularly as confidence in the US dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist trade policies.

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with projections valuing it at US$150 billion as dozens of producers compete for market share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by the approval of new, more effective medications and rising obesity rates. The article highlights that Innovent Biologics, a firm based in Jiangsu province, was the first domestic company to receive approval to market a weight-loss drug in the country. This development signals the beginning of a highly competitive and lucrative new pharmaceutical sector within China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful and long-standing social housing policies, which provide homes for a broad range of income levels. The city's housing stock is 43% social housing, which includes municipally owned units and properties managed by limited-profit associations, keeping rent levels significantly lower than the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the system has remained stable despite privatization pressures seen elsewhere in Europe. While the model is praised for making housing a basic need, challenges remain regarding the complexity of the allocation system and accessibility for newcomers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain. This allows researchers to command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. The experiment demonstrated that the bee obeyed the commands approximately 90% of the time, marking a significant advancement in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

The article highlights the psychological pressures of the 11-month season, constant travel, and performance expectations. Players are increasingly advocating for listening to one's body, finding joy outside of tennis, and working with therapists to manage the sport's immense stress.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial in Northumberland. The trunk is now the central feature of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, located near where the beloved tree once stood. The installation, designed by artist Charlie Whinney, allows visitors to touch and interact with the trunk, which is surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of hope and memory. This new chapter aims to create a positive legacy from an act of vandalism that caused widespread outrage.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to address persistent youth unemployment amid a sluggish economy and intense market competition. Authorities will offer a one-time subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) to employers who hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. To qualify, companies must sign formal contracts and make full social insurance contributions for the new hires for at least three months. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market, which also includes expanding a "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs.</p>

          <p>Shares in WK Kellogg, the North American cereal division of the Kellogg's brand, surged over 50% following reports of an imminent takeover by Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, would give the owner of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. The potential acquisition comes as traditional cereal makers like WK Kellogg face financial struggles due to shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising costs. Ferrero has been actively expanding its portfolio in recent years by acquiring other major food and confectionery brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, pausing to evaluate the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital spiked significantly, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth concerns. The decision reflects the challenge of balancing high household debt, linked to the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system, with broader economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, who were sickened by a severe toxic algal bloom, have been successfully treated and released back into the wild in Huntington Beach, California. The pelicans were among hundreds of sea animals poisoned by domoic acid from the bloom, which was the deadliest such event in years. The birds were cared for at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center, and their release was celebrated as a moment of hope by staff and community members. The event serves as a positive conclusion for some victims of the environmental crisis that affected marine life along the coast.</p>
