          <p>Nvidia announced earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by a significant 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, which includes AI chips. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance is tempered by reduced sales due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is fueled by the robust demand for its AI chips, crucial for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The gaming division also saw substantial growth, highlighting Nvidia's continued importance in both the gaming and AI sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
