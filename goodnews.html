          <h2>Trump Administration Lifts Sanctions on Syria Amidst Political Risks and Shifting Middle East Dynamics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 14:40:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to remove sanctions on Syria marks a significant shift in Middle East policy, presenting both political risks and opportunities. Syrian leader Ahmad al Sharaa, once wanted by the U.S., now leads a government that the Trump administration is engaging with, raising concerns about democratic values, protection of minorities, and the containment of ISIS. The planned meeting between Trump and Sharaa signifies a major shift in diplomatic relations, being the first in-person meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2000, while also potentially straining relations with Israel, which has taken a hawkish approach to the new Syrian government. This move reflects Trump's focus on reshaping U.S. foreign policy and prioritizing engagement over sanctions in certain contexts.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, praising his leadership and Saudi Arabia's economic development. Trump announced the end of sanctions against Syria, possibly at Saudi Arabia's and Turkey's request, marking a shift from previous U.S. policy. He credited the crown prince for Riyadh's transformation into a major business and high-tech capital. The speech signals a strengthening of U.S.-Saudi relations, despite past international criticism of the crown prince's human rights record, particularly in light of the Khashoggi assassination.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, potentially the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior groups. This adjustment, intended to offset inflation, may be lower than the 2.5% increase seen in 2025 and the lowest since 2021. The annual COLA is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded after a period of turbulence caused by President Trump's tariffs, with the S&P 500 turning positive for the year. However, investors remain cautious due to ongoing uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. While a temporary reduction in tariffs between the U.S. and China has eased immediate concerns, the lack of long-term clarity continues to affect business investment decisions. The Federal Reserve is also taking a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary impact of tariffs is better understood.</p>

          <p>Audra McDonald's performance of "Rose's Turn" in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy" is transforming audiences, offering a deeper and more visceral understanding of the character. McDonald's interpretation sheds new light and shadow on Rose, revealing a woman driven by a fear of abandonment and a desire for her mother's approval. Director George C. Wolfe describes it as a process of stripping away layers, while McDonald connects to the anxiety in her own life to deliver a powerful and emotionally resonant performance. The production's use of the passerelle and original orchestrations further enhances the number's impact.</p>
