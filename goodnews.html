        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK newspapers are focused on the government's plan to lower the voting age to 16, a move hailed as a historic reform by some but criticized by opponents as an attempt to "rig the political system." Polling suggests that fewer than one in five young people would definitely vote if an election were held tomorrow. In other news, the Labour Party has suspended MP Diane Abbott over her comments on racism, signaling a tougher stance on party discipline under Keir Starmer. Additionally, facial recognition technology will be deployed at the Notting Hill Carnival, raising civil liberties concerns.</p>

          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl after seven years, Colombian artist Juanes delivered an emotional performance dedicated to the diversity of Los Angeles and its Latino community. He addressed the fear caused by immigration raids under the Trump administration, calling for unity now more than ever. The concert featured songs from his new album "Vida cotidiana" and classics like "La camisa negra," blending his signature rock style with Latin American rhythms. He also surprised the audience by performing with local band LA LOM and closing the show with a mariachi tribute to Mexican culture.</p>

          <h2>Author Reflects on Turning 35 and the Realization That Adulthood is a Continuous Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:00:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood belief that adults have everything figured out. Instead, he has learned that most people are "winging it" through a life that is a constant state of becoming. He draws parallels to the French comedy show "Bref," which he first watched as a young immigrant in France and whose recent sequel explores the deeper themes of middle age. The author contemplates the complexities of identity, regret, and finding meaning while living in a world facing immense political and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by inventing and building his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who managed a riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to act on his lifelong fascination with invention. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) he had saved, he purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to secretly construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black craft, now slices through the local river, representing a personal dream realized through ingenuity and determination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite the moderation, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, and underlying "core-core" inflation actually ticked up slightly. Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs create uncertainty for the economic outlook. These factors weaken the conviction for another interest rate hike from the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has admitted that Europe has historically done too little to fund its own defense, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview with the BBC, Merz stated that European nations now understand they must do more and are increasing their defense spending in response to the threat posed by Russia. He emphasized a close working relationship with U.S. President Trump on coordinating efforts regarding the war in Ukraine and trade issues. Merz's comments reflect a significant shift in European defense posture and an effort to strengthen alliances within Europe.</p>

          <p>China has revealed a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, giving it greater operational flexibility. The unnamed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's V-BAT drone, was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Developed by state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone features an intelligent control system for autonomous operations, including route planning and threat avoidance. Its design allows it to operate without a runway, making it ideal for deployment in remote or rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted that AI created a scene of a collapsing building, stating the technology offers an "incredible opportunity" to enhance filmmaking, not just reduce costs. He noted the effect was completed ten times faster and at a cost that would have been unfeasible for the show's budget. This move comes amid ongoing controversy in Hollywood over AI's potential to replace human jobs, a key issue in the 2023 actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common vein condition where blood flow from the legs to the heart is impaired. The announcement addresses public speculation about the president's health, which was fueled by images of swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter being attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the TSA's restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage may be revised. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size limits for liquids could be the "next big announcement." This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. Noem did not provide a specific timeline or details for the potential change, which would alter a security measure that has been in place since a foiled 2006 liquid explosives plot.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties joined together as "Team Congress" to play against a media team in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event sets aside partisan politics to support a common cause, raising money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity that helps young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million to date. The event provides a rare moment of bipartisan unity on Capitol Hill, celebrating teamwork and supporting a deeply personal cause.</p>
