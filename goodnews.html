          <h2>Experts Detail Why Most Plastic Is Not Recycled and The Challenges of a Circular Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 05:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite public awareness, less than 10% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with experts highlighting significant systemic hurdles. The sheer variety of plastic types, many of which are not mechanically recyclable, and the widespread use of hazardous chemical additives complicate the process, often degrading the quality of recycled materials or rendering them toxic. While innovative solutions like 'microfactories' offer some hope, experts stress that effective global policy, including a strong UN Plastic Treaty and reduced production, is essential to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a 25-year-old British meteorologist who died in Antarctica in 1959, have been discovered in a melting glacier. Bell fell into a crevasse during a surveying trip and could not be recovered at the time. A Polish research team found his bones, along with personal items, at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island, carried there by the glacier's movement over decades. His 86-year-old brother expressed astonishment and relief, stating that the discovery brings a long-awaited sense of closure to his family.</p>

In this public-private partnership, OpenAI helps fund the project in return for access to high-quality, out-of-copyright data to train its language models.

          <p>The UK government is planning a major overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses every three years. The proposed road safety strategy also considers lowering the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the current system as the "laxest in Europe" after several deaths were caused by drivers with failing eyesight.</p>

          <p>With high UV levels expected, understanding sunscreen is crucial for skin protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) number indicates how much UVB radiation, which causes sunburn, is filtered; SPF 30 is generally recommended and should be reapplied every two hours. The star rating on many products measures protection against UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, consumers should choose a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating, and remember that no product offers 100% protection.</p>

After 44 years of building the family-owned business, Grant and his wife are transferring control to an employee ownership trust. This structure ensures staff will receive a share of future profits and have a say in the company's direction. The move is intended to preserve the company's legacy and its Christian-based values, which include donating 10% of profits to charity and not opening on Sundays.</p>

          <p>A small, fiery object that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite, making it slightly older than Earth itself. A University of Georgia geologist confirmed the origin after examining fragments of the space rock, which likely came from a large asteroid that broke up 470 million years ago. The event, which caused a loud boom, was witnessed across several states and marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia's history, highlighting how modern technology helps scientists track these important celestial objects.</p>

          <p>The horror film "Weapons" debuted at the top of the domestic box office, earning an impressive $42.5 million in its opening weekend. The film, from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, follows the mysterious disappearance of children from a small town. In second place was the Disney sequel "Freakier Friday," starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, which opened with $29 million. Analysts attribute the strong performance of both films to effective viral marketing campaigns and positive word-of-mouth on social media, appealing to distinct but enthusiastic audiences.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla has formally applied for a license to become an electricity supplier in the United Kingdom, potentially competing with established energy firms. The application, submitted by Tesla Energy Ventures, follows the model of its Tesla Electric service in Texas, which allows customers to optimize energy use and sell excess power back to the grid. This move into the UK energy market comes as the company faces a significant slump in its European electric vehicle sales, including a nearly 60% drop in the UK last month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing's municipal government has surprisingly eased long-standing restrictions on home purchases, a move seen as a proactive effort to bolster the struggling property market. The new policy allows eligible families to buy homes in the city's suburbs, outside the Fifth Ring Road. Analysts view this as a positive signal of the government's willingness to stimulate the market and believe it could prompt other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen to relax their own buying curbs. The timing was earlier than expected, helping to strengthen market confidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The question of how life began on Earth remains a profound scientific mystery, with water playing a central role in leading hypotheses. Scientists are investigating two primary theories: one suggesting life emerged in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and another proposing it started in shallow tide pools. The critical role of water in these origin stories is also guiding the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers are focusing on "water worlds" in our solar system, such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, as potential locations where similar life-generating processes could occur.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire that spread rapidly across Arthur's Seat, a landmark hill in central Edinburgh, has been brought under control by firefighters. The blaze broke out on Sunday afternoon during one of the city's busiest festival weekends, sending a large plume of smoke over the city and forcing the closure of parts of Holyrood Park. Four fire appliances were initially dispatched to the scene, with two remaining on Monday to manage the situation. No casualties were reported in the incident, which follows several wildfire warnings in Scotland this summer.</p>

          <p>Biddy Baxter, the long-serving and influential editor who transformed the BBC children's show "Blue Peter" into a cultural institution, has died at 92. During her tenure from 1965 to 1988, she established the show's iconic format of crafts, pets, and charity appeals, championing audience interaction long before it became common. While celebrated as a creative force, she was also known as a formidable and controlling figure who fiercely guarded the program's standards.

          <p>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has confirmed the club will likely have to sell captain and England defender Marc Guehi this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer. Guehi has entered the final year of his contract and appears unwilling to sign a new deal, though he is reportedly open to staying until his contract expires in 2026. After rejecting a £65m offer from Newcastle in January, Palace would now prefer to cash in on the player, with Liverpool reportedly interested but hoping to pay less than the club's £40m valuation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the last two seasons, all three teams promoted from the Championship have been immediately relegated from the Premier League, a trend that newly-promoted Burnley, Leeds, and Sunderland hope to break. Historically, 40 points was the benchmark for survival, but in the last decade, the average needed has dropped to around 32 points. A financial gap created by league rules puts promoted clubs at a disadvantage. Analysis suggests a team's performance in its first ten games is a strong indicator of its ultimate fate for the season.</p>
