          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its global production facilities with Chinese state-owned firm Dongfeng as part of a broader restructuring plan. This move comes as Nissan faces financial difficulties, including significant job cuts and factory closures, due to weak sales in key markets. The company aims to reduce its global production by a fifth and has already announced substantial layoffs. Nissan has a long-standing partnership with Dongfeng in China and hopes to leverage this relationship to improve its global operations. The company recently secured funding for a new battery plant in Sunderland, UK, to support its electric vehicle production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. This contraction was more significant than economists had anticipated, with uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies affecting Japan's export-dependent economy. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a positive trend, growing by 0.6%. The Bank of Japan held steady at its current interest rates and is expected to maintain this stance in the near term. The central bank has cautioned about the potential impact of trade policies on Japan's economic activity and prices.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Traditional crab fishing methods have led to numerous whale injuries and deaths, prompting the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to shorten the season. Some fishermen are experimenting with pop-up technology, a remote-controlled system that reduces rope usage, to mitigate whale entanglements. While effective, the high cost of the technology poses a challenge for many fishermen, creating a debate between tradition, finance, and environmental protection.</p>
