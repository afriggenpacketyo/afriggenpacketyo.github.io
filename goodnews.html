        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults, particularly those under 30, are turning to TikTok for their news, relying on content creators and news-adjacent memes rather than traditional media outlets. Creators like Aaron Parnas have amassed millions of followers by delivering rapid-fire updates on current events, catering to a generation with a shorter attention span. While some users see these "newsfluencers" as more authentic and less biased than corporate media, concerns remain about the platform's potential for misinformation and the algorithm's influence. The trend signifies a major shift in media consumption, challenging established news organizations to adapt.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have exposed a significant graft scheme related to the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems at inflated prices. A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and National Guard personnel were allegedly involved in taking kickbacks of up to 30% from state contracts with suppliers. The investigation was announced just two days after the independence of the anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, was restored by parliament following public protests. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy affirmed his commitment to zero tolerance for corruption, especially during wartime, a key issue for Ukraine's EU membership aspirations.</p>

          <p>Non-profit organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the historical legacy of segregation that has created significant racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the U.S. Due to decades of exclusion from public pools, a large percentage of Black children have little to no swimming ability. These programs aim to provide access and instruction to Black communities, creating a ripple effect of more swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards. By offering "swimmerships" and accessible lessons, they hope to address a public health crisis and ensure everyone has the opportunity to safely connect with water.</p>

          <p>Global pop superstar Dua Lipa has officially been granted Kosovo citizenship in a ceremony hosted by President Vjosa Osmani. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has been a vocal advocate for the country, where she lived for a period as a child. President Osmani praised her as an iconic cultural figure, and Lipa expressed that the citizenship "completes the duality" she has always felt. The singer, who now holds British, Albanian, and Kosovan citizenship, founded the Sunny Hill Festival in Kosovo to promote a positive image of the nation and supports local communities through her charity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 12:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven primarily by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of streamlined regulations for solar projects and the rising cost of natural gas, which makes solar a cheaper alternative. However, this growth faces headwinds from new federal legislation signed by President Trump that rolls back solar tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's continued solar expansion now depends on overcoming grid constraints and navigating a less supportive policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that matching your fitness routine to your personality type may lead to more enjoyable and sustainable workouts. Researchers found that different personality traits, based on the "Big Five" model, correlate with preferences for certain types of exercise. For example, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group classes and team sports, while conscientious individuals prefer goal-oriented activities like marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas open and agreeable types look for fun and variety in their workouts, such as Zumba or rock climbing.</p>

          <p>A retrospective on "The Cosby Show" highlights the nuanced and pivotal performance of the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner as Theo Huxtable. Initially portrayed as a charismatic but academically unmotivated "slacker," Theo's character arc was central to the series, evolving from a punchline into a complex young man. Warner skillfully balanced vulnerability with humor, challenging his father's rigid definition of success. The character's journey, particularly after a dyslexia diagnosis, reframed his struggles and allowed him to find purpose in mentoring others, showcasing a powerful transformation from an aimless teen to a self-aware adult.</p>

          <p>A review of Stephen Starring Grant's new memoir highlights the profound importance of the U.S. Postal Service, particularly through the eyes of a rural mail carrier in Virginia. The book, which details Grant's experiences after leaving a corporate job, suggests that postal workers provide a crucial sense of order and predictability, especially during national crises. The article frames mail delivery as a quiet form of heroism, a consistent federal service that connects even the most remote communities. It underscores how the daily, reliable act of delivering mail helps hold the country together.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals a stark contrast in how much apartment space a monthly rent of $1,500 can secure in major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget gets a renter an average of only 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can afford a spacious 1,329 square feet. The least amount of space for the money is found in expensive coastal cities like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing shortages and high demand drive up prices. Conversely, renters find the most space in Midwestern and Southern cities where housing is more affordable and land is more available.</p>
