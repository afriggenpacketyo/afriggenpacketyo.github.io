          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the most dominant postseason performances in baseball history, single-handedly leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers to sweep the National League Championship Series. Ohtani achieved a historic feat by hitting three home runs while also starting as pitcher, where he struck out ten batters over six shutout innings. This remarkable two-way display, which included becoming the first pitcher to hit a leadoff homer in MLB history, secured the Dodgers' fifth World Series appearance in nine seasons. The team will now attempt to become the first to win back-to-back championships in twenty-five years.</p>

          <p>Pratika Rawal, a 25-year-old opening batter for India's women's cricket team, has become a key player at the Women's World Cup, a journey that fulfilled her father's own unrealized sporting dreams. Her father, Pradeep Rawal, a former university-level cricketer himself, began coaching her at age three, providing unwavering support in a country where women's cricket has historically struggled for recognition. After being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, Rawal received her first national call-up and has since excelled, scoring seven fifties and a century in her short international career. Her success story highlights both her personal dedication and a changing landscape for female athletes in India.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to hold a new round of trade talks next week, aiming to de-escalate economic tensions between the two global powers. The negotiations follow President Donald Trump's recent statement that the cumulative 157% tariff rate on Chinese goods is "not sustainable," acknowledging the potential negative impact on the U.S. economy. These discussions are critical as a previous tariff truce is scheduled to expire on November 10. The talks were prompted by China's expansion of export controls on rare-earth elements, a move that led Trump to threaten even more severe tariffs in retaliation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 03:13:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study conducted in North America has yielded encouraging results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect more than 50 different types of cancer by identifying cancerous DNA fragments in the bloodstream. The trial, involving 25,000 adults, successfully identified cancers in 62% of positive results, with over half being caught at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, the test detected many cancers that currently have no screening programs, such as pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancer. While further research is needed, the findings suggest the test could significantly improve early diagnosis and is currently undergoing a large-scale trial with the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>Chen Ning Yang, a towering figure in theoretical physics who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1957, has passed away at the age of 103. Yang and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao received the prize for their groundbreaking work on parity laws, which fundamentally altered the understanding of elementary particles. Born in China in 1922, Yang later moved to the United States, contributing significantly to various fields of physics throughout his prolific career at institutions like the University of Chicago. He eventually returned to China as a professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University, leaving a profound and lasting legacy in the world of science.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor after a seemingly minor accident during a weekend trip with friends. Charlotte Morjaria went to the hospital believing she had broken a rib after being playfully lifted over someone's shoulder, but a precautionary CT scan revealed the hidden tumor. She had previously dismissed symptoms like fatigue and back pain, attributing them to other factors. Following the chance discovery, she underwent surgery to remove her kidney and has since been declared cancer-free, crediting the holiday mishap with saving her life.</p>

The documents revealed his father, who he knew as an Englishman, was born into a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Berlin named Eisner. The family's vast steel empire and properties were forcibly sold or transferred under duress during the Nazi regime before they fled to England in 1939. This discovery launched a decade-long investigation that has led to the successful restitution of a valuable painting from a Berlin museum, bringing a measure of justice and reconnecting him with his lost heritage.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing solution named Aegaeon that it claims can cut the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required to serve its AI models by 82 percent. During a three-month test, the system reduced the number of high-demand Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to just 213 while serving dozens of large language models concurrently. This innovation addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where many GPUs are allocated to AI models that are only used sporadically. The GPU pooling system could lead to significant cost savings and more efficient resource management in the rapidly growing AI sector.</p>
