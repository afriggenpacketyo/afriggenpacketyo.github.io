          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend but will remain over open waters, posing no immediate threat to land. The storm's projected path shows it moving north of the Caribbean and potentially passing east of Bermuda next week. This development occurs in what has so far been a quieter hurricane season than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>This article offers a guide on buying refurbished electronics, emphasizing that the term lacks a uniform standard and quality can vary significantly. It advises consumers to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process, check for at least a 90-day warranty, and research the seller's reputation on platforms like Amazon Renewed or Apple Certified Refurbished. Other key tips include verifying included accessories, inquiring about battery health, ensuring the device still receives software updates, and thoroughly testing the product upon arrival to avoid potential issues.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, shares insights from remodeling his family's home into a "Green Idea House" that generates more energy than it consumes. The project, completed for less than a traditional remodel, relies on rooftop solar panels, all-electric appliances, and smart design features like strategic roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling. The owner emphasizes the importance of extensive research, meticulous planning, and persistence with contractors to achieve environmental goals. Despite challenges like a warming climate requiring new adaptations, the home has eliminated utility bills for over a decade.</p>

The article highlights his role as a stabilizing force of excellence during turbulent times for the franchise, including a bankruptcy and a 20-year postseason series win drought. Kershaw's tenure bridged the gap to the Dodgers' current era of dominance, marked by 13 consecutive postseason berths. His career, featuring three Cy Young Awards and a historically low ERA, is celebrated as central to the team's revival.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests in Nepal, largely organized by Gen Z activists, has resulted in the overthrow of the government and the appointment of the country's first female prime minister, Sushila Karki. The turmoil was fueled by widespread public anger over government corruption and high unemployment, amplified by social media campaigns exposing the lavish lifestyles of political elites. After violent clashes between police and protesters led to dozens of deaths, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli resigned. The events in Nepal reflect a broader trend of youth-driven political upheaval across South Asia.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are considered both a delicacy and a dietary staple. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects are a vital source of protein and vitamins in a country where conventional meat is often unaffordable for many. While caterpillars can be expensive, the more common maggots are being commercially raised by NGOs like Farms for Orphans to combat malnutrition. The practice, rooted in tradition, has reportedly grown in recent decades due to economic hardship and food scarcity.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are engaged in an urgent race to land humans on the moon by the end of the decade, with both nations targeting the strategic lunar south pole. The U.S. Artemis program, initiated by President Trump, aims to establish a permanent base, but faces potential funding cuts and delays with its SpaceX-developed rocket. Meanwhile, China has made significant progress on its own launch and lander systems, raising concerns among U.S. officials that Beijing could arrive first and claim resource-rich areas. This new space race carries significant national security implications for future lunar exploration.</p>

          <p>Prominent television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in Los Angeles, even as many productions leave California for cheaper locations. Despite challenges like recent wildfires disrupting his new series, Kelley's company chose to remain, benefiting from state tax credits and supporting the local industry. All of his current projects, including "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," will shoot in the state. This decision comes as California boosts its film tax credit program to counteract production decline and retain entertainment industry jobs.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including British 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have complained about the inconvenient location of the main warm-up facility. The track is a 15-minute bus journey from the main stadium, forcing competitors into a draining, two-hour pre-competition routine. World Athletics president Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is "not perfect," explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available. Organizers state they have done everything possible to manage the logistical challenges within the available constraints.</p>

          <p>South African police have dismantled a large-scale crystal methamphetamine laboratory on a farm in the eastern part of the country, seizing drugs with an estimated street value of $20 million. Five individuals from a North American country were arrested during the raid, while two other suspects, believed to be from West Africa, managed to escape. The discovery of industrial manufacturing equipment highlights South Africa's role as both a major consumer market and a key transit point for illicit drugs, according to UN reports on the region's porous borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores limerence, a state of intense romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while it's a natural part of early love, it can become a harmful "person addiction" if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals, which escalates desire. To break the cycle, he recommends strategies like limiting contact, consciously turning positive daydreams into negative "daymares" to spoil the mental reward, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their party conference, they face the challenge of defining their path forward after a successful general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's stunt-heavy campaign grabbed attention and helped the party win seats, but polling suggests voters now want to see more seriousness. The party's next strategic move is debated: should they continue targeting traditional Conservative voters in southern England, or expand their focus? Insiders acknowledge the need to broaden their policy platform beyond care issues and find ways to make moderate positions exciting in a polarized political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and reducing cognitive load. Tools like ChatGPT can assist with summarizing information and managing projects, with some studies showing a drop in emotional exhaustion in teams that use them. However, other research suggests that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can create pressure to take on more work and requires time to learn. Experts caution that while AI can be a helpful companion, companies must manage its implementation to avoid simply replacing one form of stress with another.</p>
