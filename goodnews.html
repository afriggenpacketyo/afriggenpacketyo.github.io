          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, has announced its intention to shift its primary listing location to the United States, a move that will be a fresh setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company plans to establish a dual listing, with its main hub in the U.S. while retaining a secondary listing in London. Wise believes this change will enable its shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its visibility and attracting a broader range of investors. This decision reflects a growing trend of companies seeking U.S. listings to access deeper capital markets and a larger investor base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A charity, Thin Blue Paw, is advocating for pensions to support retired police dogs due to their significant medical needs resulting from their service. These dogs, who risk their lives apprehending suspects and dealing with public disorder, often face chronic health issues and injuries. Laura Meller, who has adopted three retired police dogs, estimates she has spent ¬£12,000 on their care. Concerns are growing that rising vet costs may deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for older dogs. Nottinghamshire Police announced in 2013 it would start paying pensions to its retiring dogs.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition by leveraging its solar panel technology, potentially creating a model for other Global South countries. The Renewables First report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants and solar panels, as they cannot both succeed in the same market. The report emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing, given rising global trade tensions and China‚Äôs export restrictions on critical minerals. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether this vision is too expensive to be realistic, highlighting the complexities of balancing economic interests and sustainable development.</p>
