          <p>This article discusses the limitations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and proposes a shift toward protecting entire ecosystems rather than focusing solely on individual species. The author suggests that the current approach, which requires specific plans for each endangered species, is inefficient and can be undermined if a single species goes extinct. Instead, the article advocates for a "native ecosystem-protection act" to supplement the ESA, ensuring that each type of American ecosystem has sufficient protected area. This approach recognizes the dynamic nature of ecosystems and could provide broader protection for biodiversity.</p>

          <p>After years of studying parent-child relationships, the author introduces "emotionally safe parenting" as a framework for raising successful children. This approach emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and take responsibility after conflicts.
