The removal of the cap, which had been in place for seven years due to past misconduct, allows the bank to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth areas, and reduce compliance costs. Cramer raised the price target on Wells Fargo stock to $90 a share, calling the event a "watershed moment."

It counters the idea that a smaller government would be less harmful, stating that Trump has been consolidating power by reducing the size of government agencies that impede him. The author contends that a robust state is essential for providing a social safety net and responding to crises, and that oversight mechanisms are crucial for constraining government power and protecting against abuse.</p>

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom has been put on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The artifact, dating back to 1830, is believed to be made from a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. The museum acquired the rare item at an auction last year and notes that it is the first example of a print on a condom in their collection. The condom is considered a souvenir from a brothel and is one of only two known to have survived.</p>
