          <h2>UK and EU Grapple with Uneasy Relationship Despite New Trade Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 21:44:18 EDT</div>

          <p>Chris Mason's article discusses the UK's ongoing and complex relationship with the EU, even after Brexit, highlighting the limitations imposed by the government's self-imposed guardrails during negotiations. The new deal seeks to reduce trade frictions, but numerous details, timelines, and costs remain to be addressed. Some critics argue that the agreement concedes too much power to the EU through 'dynamic alignment,' while ministers view it as a worthwhile compromise. The first UK-EU summit is planned to be the first of many, emphasizing the continuous need for conversation and negotiation between the two entities. The article emphasizes that the UK's relationship with the EU is a permanent or semi-permanent reset, and the direction of the current government is towards a closer relationship.</p>

          <p>Netflix has reached an agreement to bring Sesame Street to its streaming platform after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with HBO. Starting later this year, Netflix will offer its global subscribers the 56th season of the show, along with 90 hours of previous episodes, while PBS will simultaneously have access to the episodes. Sesame Street has had a long history of influencing social issues, with segments on healthy eating and appearances before Congress. Netflix's increasing focus on children's content aligns with the platform's strategy to engage a broad audience.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025, with funds primarily allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. CATL has faced challenges including punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and scrutiny over alleged links to China's military, which the company denies. Despite a revenue drop in 2024, the company's net profit increased, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles in China.</p>

          <p>The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure had faced Democratic opposition due to concerns over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. Senator Mark Warner, while supporting the bill, expressed concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to evade oversight. Senator Elizabeth Warren opposed the bill, arguing it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. The bill moved forward with bipartisan support after negotiators addressed some concerns.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, as Beijing seeks to stimulate its economy amidst trade tensions. The People's Bank of China lowered the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. These rate cuts follow earlier reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders and are part of a broader package of stimulus measures.
