        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein face challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and high tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite these obstacles, experts believe the companies will remain competitive by accelerating localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and leveraging economies of scale through bulk shipments to U.S. warehouses. Shein is also expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil. These companies have previously offered products at a third of the price of Amazon, so they will still be price competitive despite the tariffs. The article also notes that agile supply chains are key to the success of these companies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval faces two challengers in the city's nonpartisan primary, including Cory Bowman, Vice President JD Vance's half brother. Bowman, an evangelical pastor and coffee shop owner, and fellow Republican challenger Brian Frank, aim to unseat the incumbent Democrat. Bowman states his half brother's inauguration inspired him to get involved in politics and improve the city. Pureval, a former special assistant U.S. attorney, won the 2021 mayoral race with nearly 66% of the vote. Voters will also be voting on State Issue 2, which seeks to reauthorize a program for local infrastructure projects.</p>
