          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target, increasing it from 2% of gross domestic product to 5% by 2035, marking a significant commitment in over a decade. The decision comes amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the war between Ukraine and Russia, reflecting heightened security concerns. The joint declaration emphasizes unity in the face of profound security threats, particularly from Russia and terrorism. This historic move follows years of pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has consistently advocated for increased defense spending among NATO members. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump will make a full state visit to the UK later this year, following an invitation from King Charles, after scheduling conflicts prevented an informal meeting over the summer. The dates for the visit are yet to be confirmed, with September being the most likely timeframe. This marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, with the first one having taken place in 2019 during his first term in office, when he was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II. The King has known President Trump for many years and looks forward to hosting him and the First Lady later this year.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is promoting the use of wearable technology, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, to empower Americans to take control of their health. He envisions a future where most Americans use wearables to monitor health metrics like glucose levels and heart rates, enabling informed decisions about diet and physical activity. The Department of Health and Human Services plans to launch a major advertising campaign to encourage the adoption of these devices, highlighting their potential to improve health outcomes at a lower cost than prescription drugs. Kennedy has been a long-time proponent of healthy eating over medicine as a means to combat obesity, advocating for such approaches as part of his mission to "Make America Healthy Again."</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to be holding after days of deadly conflict, following a last-minute intervention by President Trump. Despite initial accusations of violations from both sides, including missile launches and retaliatory strikes, the bombardments ceased after Trump's direct engagement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem reopened, and travel restrictions for U.S. government employees were eased, signaling a return to relative normalcy. The conflict, which began on June 13, resulted in at least 1,000 deaths and heightened tensions in the region. </p>

          <p>Louisiana has made significant investments to attract Meta's $10 billion data center, which will be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, transforming the state's economy. The state provided a 20-year sales tax exemption and a large, shovel-ready site to meet Meta's requirements for rapid expansion. The data center is expected to create 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs, though it will also consume a large amount of energy, prompting the construction of three new gas-fired power plants. State officials believe this project will put Louisiana on the map for future business investments, but it also raises questions about the balance between economic development and resource consumption. </p>

          <p>The British pound has reached its highest level in over three years, prompting varied forecasts from analysts regarding its potential for further gains. While some attribute the pound's strength to underlying dollar weakness and recovery from post-mini budget lows, others suggest limited near-term upside due to softer UK economic momentum. Predictions range from continued dollar depreciation and a stronger euro to a more bearish outlook, citing macroeconomic factors. Despite the diverging views, geopolitical developments and improved relations with the EU could catalyze further upward movements in the longer term. </p>
