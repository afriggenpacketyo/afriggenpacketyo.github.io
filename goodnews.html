          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has released stunning new images celebrating its third anniversary, revealing a vibrant star-forming region within the Cat's Paw Nebula. The images show young, massive stars carving through gas and dust, creating a colorful cosmic landscape about 4,000 light-years from Earth. These observations provide new insights into the lifecycle of stars and the dynamic processes that shape galaxies. The telescope continues to exceed expectations, uncovering previously hidden aspects of the universe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the catastrophic flooding in Texas, disaster preparedness experts are outlining crucial safety measures for flash floods. Key advice includes understanding your area's flood risk, creating a household emergency plan, and packing a "go bag" with essentials well before a storm hits. During a flood, the priority is to get to higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches can sweep a person away. After the event, residents should wait for the all-clear from authorities before returning home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers are advised to be more strategic with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. The article highlights three key mistakes to avoid this summer: assuming CD rates will only drop after official Fed action, getting distracted by higher short-term rates, and failing to calculate potential earnings before depositing. Proactively locking in a high-rate, long-term CD now could protect savings against future rate decreases and maximize overall returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gwinnett County has dropped the remaining traffic charges against Mario Guevara, a Spanish-language journalist who was arrested while covering a protest and subsequently handed over to ICE. Guevara, who has reported in the U.S. for over 20 years and has a work permit, was held in federal custody for weeks despite being granted bond. His attorneys argued the charges were a pretext to detain him over his reporting on immigration enforcement. The case drew significant public interest and raised concerns about press freedom and the targeting of journalists.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock jumped over 12% after the carrier reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a more optimistic outlook for the travel industry. CEO Ed Bastian stated that bookings have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, driven by renewed consumer confidence. The airline now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share, a downward revision from its initial forecast but stronger than Wall Street anticipated. The positive report, fueled by strong premium cabin sales, boosted shares across the airline sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An annuity can serve as a powerful tool to complement Social Security, creating a more secure and predictable retirement income. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which can increase their monthly government checks by up to 8% per year of delay. This strategy helps cover expenses during the bridge period before claiming. Additionally, annuities can help manage the taxability of Social Security benefits and create a reliable "floor" of income to cover essential living costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will take a significant step toward robotic umpires by using the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during its upcoming All-Star Game. Each team will receive two challenges that can be initiated by the batter, pitcher, or catcher to review a ball or strike call, with successful challenges being retained. The system uses Hawk-Eye technology to track the pitch, and its use in the showcase event will serve as a major test for potential implementation in the 2026 regular season. Human umpire accuracy has already improved dramatically due to pitch-tracking analysis.</p>

          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional grit, finishing the day one run short of a century with an unbeaten 99, to guide England to 251-4 against India at Lord's. On a slow, dry pitch, England's batters were forced to abandon their usual aggressive style in favor of a more attritional approach. The hosts were in precarious positions at 44-2 and later 172-4, but Root's steadying presence, including a key partnership with Ollie Pope, held the innings together. Captain Ben Stokes provided support with 39 not out, though he appeared to be struggling with an injury.</p>

          <p>After U.S. President Donald Trump commented on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," the incident has drawn attention to the unique, long-standing ties between the two countries. Liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American-influenced accent. The nation's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. Liberia's foreign minister stated they were not offended, seeing it as a reflection of a lack of global understanding about Africa.</p>
