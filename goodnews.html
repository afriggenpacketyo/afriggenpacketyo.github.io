          <p>An exhibition in Shanghai is showcasing early and rare editions of Edgar Snow's influential 1937 book, "Red Star Over China," to commemorate the anniversary of World War II. The display includes the original English version, the first U.S. edition, and the earliest Chinese translation from 1938. Snow's work provided one of the first Western accounts of the Chinese Communist Party's early days, featuring interviews with key figures like Mao Zedong.

          <p>A personal finance reporter shares insights gained from her recent experience purchasing a wedding dress, highlighting unexpected costs and timing issues that can impact a wedding budget. She explains that ordering a dress too close to the wedding date can incur significant "rush fees," which in her case would have added 20% to the cost. The article advises brides to start shopping about a year in advance and to create a comprehensive "attire budget" that includes not just the dress but also alterations, a veil, and other accessories, which can add substantial, often overlooked, expenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, author and anti-diet advocate Virginia Sole-Smith addresses the growing anxiety surrounding children's diets, particularly concerning ultra-processed foods. She argues that restricting kids' food can be harmful and that the focus should be on ensuring access to enough food rather than obsessing over nutritional minutiae. Sole-Smith suggests that much of the panic is rooted in "diet culture," which teaches people to distrust their bodies and creates unhealthy power struggles. She advises parents to focus on fostering a joyful relationship with food and respecting a child's bodily autonomy.</p>

          <p>While many congressional Republicans have avoided public forums, Missouri Representative Mark Alford has distinguished himself by holding 15 public events and town halls across his district. Despite representing a safely Republican area, Alford faced pointed questions and criticism from constituents, particularly concerning the new Republican tax and spending package and its cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The article notes that Alford handled the tense but mostly civil events by listening to concerns and defending the legislation, stating his goal was to earn voters' respect, even if he couldn't win their votes.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has completed the signing of German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club-record fee that could reach up to £69 million. The 23-year-old, who stands at 6ft 6in, has signed a six-year contract with the Premier League club. This transfer surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak's signing and is seen as a significant move for Newcastle's attacking options. Woltemade had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals and winning the German Cup, before finishing as the top scorer at the Under-21 Euros.</p>

          <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average retiree aged 65 to 74 spent approximately $5,429 per month in 2023, with housing, transportation, and food being the top expenses. However, financial experts caution that these figures may not fully capture the impact of healthcare costs, which can vary dramatically and become a significant, unpredictable expense for many middle-class retirees. While the official average for healthcare is $662 per month, some experts note that actual costs can be much higher, significantly altering a household's retirement budget.

The new initiative aims not only to resurrect the accessible scientific content but also to expand its mission to offer climate-related services directly to local governments. The effort is being crowdfunded as the team seeks to create a new, independent cornerstone for public climate literacy.</p>

          <p>Preliminary data from the CDC indicates that fatal drug overdoses in the United States have fallen to their lowest level in five years, with a steady decline observed since mid-2023. Despite this significant drop in deaths, President Donald Trump has continued to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies such as new mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts are studying the reasons for the sharp decline, attributing it to a combination of successful supply chain disruptions and improved access to addiction treatment and healthcare services.</p>
