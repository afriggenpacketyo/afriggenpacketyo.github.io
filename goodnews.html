          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, in connection with an alleged plot to attack her free concert on Copacabana Beach with improvised explosives. The suspects, linked to an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were apprehended as part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat to the singer's performance. Authorities executed search warrants in multiple cities, but no explosives were found. Lady Gaga's spokesperson stated that the singer and her team were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, drawing over two million fans. This news comes as a relief, as the concert was able to proceed without harm.</p>
