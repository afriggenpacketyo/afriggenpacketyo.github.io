          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of nebulae and galaxies with unprecedented clarity. The observatory will conduct a decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), scanning the night sky daily to track asteroids and interstellar objects. Among the first images are composite photos of the Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae, as well as the Virgo Cluster containing thousands of galaxies. This observatory is a joint initiative of the US National Science Foundation and Department of Energy and is named after Vera C. Rubin, a pioneering astronomer.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have found initial evidence suggesting that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may affect the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons, which are produced by cosmic rays, and gamma ray-induced quasiparticle bursts. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>

          <p>Aaron Wolf, the Tokyo Olympic judo gold medalist, has announced his transition to a career in professional wrestling, joining New Japan Pro Wrestling. The 29-year-old retired from judo earlier in June, after winning gold in the men's 100-kilogram division at the 2021 Olympics and finishing seventh at the Paris Games. Wolf, who is already a well-known media personality, follows in the footsteps of Naoya Ogawa, a former judo silver medalist who also became a pro wrestler.

          <p>The Japanese government has indicated some support for the U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites, viewing them as a demonstration of Washington's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation while acknowledging U.S. efforts to pursue dialogue. Japan, which relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil, has traditionally maintained amicable ties with Iran while upholding its security alliance with the United States.

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge increased defense spending at their annual summit, driven by pressure from the U.S. to reach 5% of GDP.

While some members support this goal, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold, leading to potential clashes over the specifics of the pledges.

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience. In 2024, the Russian economy expanded by 4.3%, outpacing all G7 nations, driven by record military spending and stable oil exports redirected to China and India. However, challenges such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and worker shortages are emerging, leading to concerns about stagnation.
