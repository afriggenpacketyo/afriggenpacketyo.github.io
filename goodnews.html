          <p>An opinion piece challenges the narrative of the 'China shock' causing widespread job losses in the U.S. The article argues that while some manufacturing jobs were indeed affected, cheap Chinese goods made life more affordable for average Americans. It questions the influential research that defends the 'China shock' claim, suggesting the overall impact may have been more beneficial than commonly perceived. This perspective offers a counterargument to the anti-China sentiment prevalent in U.S. politics, particularly among those who feel negatively impacted by trade policies. The article presents an alternative viewpoint on the economic relationship between the two nations, emphasizing potential benefits alongside the acknowledged challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth remained steady at 1.3% in the first quarter of the year, falling short of economists' predictions amidst ongoing global trade tensions. The GDP figure aligns with the previous quarter's growth, signaling a slowdown in economic momentum. This news comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) recently reduced interest rates to a two-year low in May, providing some flexibility to ease monetary policy in response to easing inflation. While the RBA anticipates a recovery in consumption and continued public demand to drive GDP growth in 2025, it also acknowledges weaker global demand and domestic uncertainty may result in a more gradual upswing. The central bank will continue to monitor economic conditions and adjust monetary policy as needed to support sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>Despite delivering quarterly beats on key metrics, CrowdStrike experienced a post-earnings sell-off due to mixed guidance, prompting analysts to raise the price target. Revenue increased by 20% year-over-year, with growth observed across all major geographic regions. The company's Falcon Flex subscription model is reportedly accelerating platform adoption, indicating strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. This suggests the post-release decline will likely present a buying opportunity, as cybersecurity remains a critical expense for corporations regardless of economic conditions.
