          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen ($27) per 5 kilograms, reaching 3,920 yen, for the first time since March, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the drop to the release of additional rice reserves. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to reduce the average retail price to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June. Measures have been implemented to prohibit reselling rice bought at retail stores at higher prices to ensure stable consumer access.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing care delays and physician burnout. Plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna committed to actions aimed at connecting patients to care more quickly and reducing administrative burdens. These changes will be implemented across various markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting an estimated 257 million Americans. The goal is to ensure patients receive medically necessary care without unnecessary delays or administrative hurdles.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist candidate for New York City mayor, has significantly narrowed the gap with frontrunner Andrew Cuomo ahead of the Democratic primary. Mamdani's campaign has gained traction through social media and endorsements from prominent progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. His platform includes policies such as rent freezes, free city buses, and increased taxes on corporations and high-income earners. Despite facing criticism for his limited political record, Mamdani's campaign has energized young voters and sparked debate on the city's future direction.</p>

          <p>Tesla launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, marking a significant step in autonomous transportation. This service is being compared to Baidu's Apollo Go, which began testing in China in 2019 and has since expanded to over 15 cities, including Hong Kong and Dubai. While Tesla's Robotaxi is initially available in Austin, Elon Musk plans to expand based on performance. Apollo Go currently operates commercially in several cities, offering driverless taxi services. The comparison highlights the growing competition in the autonomous vehicle industry between American and Chinese tech companies.</p>

          <p>Following US-China talks in London, there are indications that Beijing may have gained a negotiating edge over Washington, although observers caution against expecting a full restoration of senior-level exchanges. President Trump's competing priorities could divert attention from establishing a lasting agreement on US-China trade relations. Despite this, Beijing should advance a leader-driven process to stabilize bilateral ties and lay the groundwork for a trade agreement ahead of a potential summit. The framework reached in London represents a temporary truce, with China currently positioned as a front-runner in Washington's trade negotiations.</p>
