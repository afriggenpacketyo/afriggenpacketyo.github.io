          <p>Several top tennis players, including Alex de Minaur and Iga Swiatek, have voiced concerns regarding the increasingly unsustainable physical demands of the tennis calendar. De Minaur cited burnout as a factor in his early French Open exit, while Swiatek described the tour's demands as "pretty exhausting". Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race," and De Minaur suggested that players' careers might shorten due to mental exhaustion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that while parents in Europe find greater meaning in life compared to their childfree counterparts, they often experience lower life satisfaction, particularly mothers. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that this satisfaction is influenced by living situations and family policies within their respective countries. Scandinavian countries exhibit smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents, attributed to robust childcare, financial support, and a societal view of children as a shared responsibility. Gender equality also plays a role, with more equal pay and partnerships contributing to greater parental satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite potentially impacting medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction due to increasing injuries among younger athletes. While World Skate mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers will keep domestic competitions open to younger stars. The move aligns with the International Olympic Committee's efforts to protect child athletes.</p>

          <p>An amendment to Japan's Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation in prisons, has taken effect, marking the first change to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with or without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law introduces 24 tailored programs based on age, characteristics, and other factors, including specialized curricula for elderly inmates and addiction recovery programs. The new system aims to reduce recidivism by addressing individual needs and circumstances.</p>
