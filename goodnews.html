Authorities arrested a man believed to be the group's leader and detained a teenager for storing child pornography. The concert proceeded without incident, drawing an estimated 2.1 million fans.</p>

He also mentioned potential Republican successors, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump defended his handling of the economy, dismissing criticism despite recent economic contraction following the implementation of his tariff plan.</p>
