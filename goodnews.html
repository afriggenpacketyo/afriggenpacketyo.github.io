          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged past $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by optimism surrounding the U.S.-UK trade deal announcement. The cryptocurrency's rise began overnight, coinciding with Trump's announcement of the trade agreement. Analysts suggest Bitcoin's resurgence reaffirms its status as a resilient asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Despite not yet surpassing January's high, the rebound indicates potential for further gains, with buying from long-term holders offsetting selling pressure from short-term investors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, suggesting it would act as 'jet fuel' for the markets. Trump claims Powell's reluctance stems from personal feelings rather than economic considerations. This criticism follows the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump believes lower rates would counter a potential economic slowdown, contrasting with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which have both lowered their borrowing rates. Powell maintains that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since implementing 'reciprocal' tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. While specifics were not fully detailed, both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed optimism, noting the agreement is still being finalized. The deal suggests a baseline tariff of 10% on UK goods entering the U.S., while UK duties on U.S. goods will decrease to between 1.8% and 5.1%.</p>

          <p>A woman in the UK has been acquitted of having an illegal abortion after a jury found her not guilty. The woman, Nicola Packer, took abortion medicine at home when she was approximately 26 weeks pregnant, which is beyond the legal limit for at-home abortions. Packer claimed she was unaware of how far along she was in her pregnancy and expressed shock at the situation. The case raised questions about access to abortion services during the coronavirus lockdown and the legal limits for terminating a pregnancy.</p>

          <p>This article explores the different types of bankruptcy available for individuals struggling with debt, noting that no type of bankruptcy eliminates every debt. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as liquidation bankruptcy, offers the most comprehensive debt relief by eliminating many unsecured debts, but it is income-based and has limitations. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a structured repayment plan over three to five years, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect more assets. The article also suggests alternatives like debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement for those seeking to avoid bankruptcy.</p>

The decision was influenced by concerns that the global trade war could hit UK economic growth, although a UK-US trade deal was welcomed. The rate cut is expected to impact mortgage repayments for some homeowners, while the Bank aims to maintain inflation close to its target of 2%.</p>

The decision has been welcomed by Nvidia, which argued that restricting chip exports limits U.S. leadership in advanced technology. The rule, proposed in the final days of the Biden administration, would have categorized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip exports.</p>
