          <p>Chile's governing leftist coalition has elected former labor minister Jeannette Jara as its presidential candidate for the upcoming November elections. Jara, a member of the Communist Party, secured a decisive victory in the primary with over 60% of the vote. She gained popularity for her role in passing legislation to reduce the standard work week to 40 hours. Jara will now face a field of right-wing contenders, including Evelyn Matthei and Jose Antonio Kast, who are currently leading in presidential polls amid public concern over crime and immigration.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center spent nearly five months carefully rehabilitating the cub, focusing on medical care while preserving its wild instincts. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The center is also caring for two other orphaned cubs with the same goal of returning them to their natural habitat.</p>

          <p>The quest to find the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. Enthusiasts use trail cams and forensic techniques in the Tasmanian bush, driven by a passionate belief that the creature still exists. Meanwhile, a separate scientific endeavor is attempting to bring the animal back through de-extinction, using the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists are skeptical of both efforts, the search highlights a powerful blend of hope, remorse for the species' loss, and human fascination with the unknown.</p>

          <p>Legendary German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for a six-decade career making unconventional films that explore the edges of sanity and the power of nature. From hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for "Fitzcarraldo" to documenting the tragic life of "Grizzly Man," Herzog has consistently pushed boundaries to achieve his artistic vision. He believes in the value of "good criminal energy" for filmmaking, having once stolen a camera to start his career. Still actively working, he maintains that his prose and poetry will ultimately outlive his extensive and respected body of film work.</p>

          <p>The Principality of Sealand, a former World War II anti-aircraft fort located seven miles off the English coast, continues its eccentric history as a self-declared micronation. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates, the "country" has its own currency, constitution, and royal family, and has survived everything from pirate radio rivalries to an armed coup by German and Dutch businessmen. Today, with a full-time population of one, Sealand's royal descendants fund the operation by selling aristocratic titles online. The story of Sealand endures as a quirky testament to independence and the power of a national myth.</p>

          <p>Kenya is actively positioning itself as Africa's premier technology hub, dubbed the "Silicon Savannah," leveraging a young, tech-savvy population and pioneering services like the M-Pesa mobile money platform. The government is courting investment from global tech giants like Microsoft to create jobs for its rapidly growing workforce. However, this growth is accompanied by challenges, including criticism of the low wages and poor working conditions faced by digital laborers hired by outsourcing firms. For Kenya to realize its ambition, it must balance attracting foreign investment with updating its labor laws to protect its workers.</p>

Despite a strong second-half surge from the Sparks, fueled by Emma Cannon's season-high 15 points, Chicago closed the game strong to overcome the deficit.

Based on a recent trip with his students, Mahboubi observed an incredibly warm and welcoming reception in China.

          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land across 11 Western states has been withdrawn from the Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced significant bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, conservationists, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he pulled the provision because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation groups celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future threats to federal lands under the Trump administration.</p>
