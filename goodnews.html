Moore stressed the importance of taking action and delivering tangible alternatives to Trump's policies, while Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and for every school board seat. Neither governor indicated any intention to run for president in 2028, focusing instead on the immediate challenges facing the party.</p>

          <p>German antitrust regulators have cautioned Amazon that its pricing mechanisms for third-party sellers could violate competition laws. The Federal Cartel Office is concerned that Amazon's algorithms, which set price caps for products, may limit the visibility of merchants' products and interfere with their freedom to set prices. Amazon competes directly with other marketplace retailers on its platform, making the practice questionable from a competition perspective. The Cartel Office believes this could also harm other retailers by deterring them from offering lower prices.</p>
