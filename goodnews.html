          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett outlines three main categories of assets. He cautions against currency-denominated investments like bonds, which are subject to government policy and inflation, and non-productive assets like gold, which generate no value on their own. Instead, Buffett champions the third category: productive assets such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on what they can produce over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is determined by their actual output, not by daily market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global movement is underway in major cities like New York, London, and Montreal to reclaim street space from cars for cyclists, making urban areas cleaner and safer. This transformation involves building protected bike lanes, redesigning intersections to improve visibility, and tweaking traffic signals to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists. The shift, amplified by the rise of e-bikes, is credited with reducing carbon emissions, saving residents money, and improving public health. These changes are fostering a more sustainable and livable urban environment for all residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common path for Americans who have been divorced, with about two-thirds choosing to marry again. The data indicates that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women. Furthermore, the study highlights a significant economic aspect of this trend, showing that the median household wealth of remarried individuals is substantially higher than that of divorced adults and is comparable to those in their first marriage. This suggests that remarriage often corresponds with a significant recovery in financial stability.</p>

          <h2>The 'Cringe' of Anti-Trump Resistance Is Argued to Be an Effective Political Tool</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, proposing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is a potent weapon against the cynicism inherent in authoritarian politics. It argues that while the movement's aesthetics, like pink hats, were mocked, its underlying belief in democracy fueled tangible successes, such as the 2018 midterm elections. The author suggests that in an era of political nihilism, sincere, unironic belief in civic values, however uncool it may seem, is a necessary and effective form of opposition. This approach counters a political climate that thrives on eroding conviction.</p>
