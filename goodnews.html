        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill, the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," has been introduced in the Senate to permanently eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposed legislation aims to provide financial relief to seniors by also adjusting the Social Security payroll tax to apply to annual earnings over $250,000, significantly higher than the current cap. This contrasts with a temporary senior deduction recently passed, which offers more limited relief. Proponents argue the bill would extend the solvency of Social Security's trust funds for an additional 24 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling has opened the possibility for American businesses to receive tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs paid on foreign goods. The court found that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping country-based tariffs. However, the administration is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, creating ongoing uncertainty for businesses regarding pricing and potential reimbursement. If the ruling is upheld, the government would need to establish a process for refunding the collected levies, which could be complex. (not investment advice)</p>

This growth is attributed to a rebound in the stock market during the second quarter and consistent savings behaviors among account holders.

The article details their close personal relationship, which adds a friendly, under-the-radar dynamic to the high-stakes AFC West rivalry. Before hiring Woodhouse, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh respectfully called Reid to ensure there were no issues, a gesture Reid praised as a "class act." Woodhouse, who refers to his father-in-law as "Coach," focuses on his professional responsibilities despite the family tie.</p>

          <h2>Ford Reports Strong Sales Growth for its Large, Gas-Powered Expedition SUV</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford's redesigned three-row Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up nearly 54% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth highlights continued strong consumer demand for large, traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, even as the market for electric vehicles expands. While Ford's EV sales also saw an increase, the success of the profitable Expedition signals that a key segment of the market still prefers gas-powered family vehicles. The robust sales of this higher-end model also suggest that some consumers are still willing to make large vehicle purchases.</p>

          <h2>Invasive Seaweed Decomposing on Massachusetts Shore Causes Pervasive "Rotten Egg" Odor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:39:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts are experiencing a strong, unpleasant odor likened to rotten eggs, which officials have traced to a large amount of invasive Japanese seaweed. The seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, was washed ashore by the rough surf from Hurricane Erin and is now decaying in the Good Harbor estuary. City officials explained that while the smell is concerning, it is part of a natural decomposition process. The red seaweed is known for spreading aggressively and has been linked to fish die-offs, but the city stated the odor should dissipate as the seaweed continues to break down.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Suggests Linking University Tuition Fees to Teaching Quality</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has proposed the idea of "differential fee levels" for universities based on the quality of their teaching. This could mean that institutions with higher teaching standards might be allowed to charge different tuition fees than those with lower rankings. Currently, most universities charge a uniform fee, but this suggestion could incentivize improvements in educational quality. The proposal comes as many universities face financial deficits, and any final decision on fee structures would be made by the government, which is expected to release its plans this autumn.</p>
