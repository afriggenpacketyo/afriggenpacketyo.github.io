          <p>An appeals court in New York has overturned the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on Donald Trump and his company in a civil fraud case, deeming it an "excessive fine" under the U.S. Constitution. The court, however, upheld the original ruling that Trump and other defendants committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. While non-monetary sanctions remain in place, the state's Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to New York's highest court.</p>

While companies were already increasing U.S. manufacturing due to tax incentives, the complexity and long timelines involved show that outrunning new trade policies will be a formidable challenge for the industry.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has announced a partnership with drone delivery company Zipline to test an autonomous food delivery service for select customers in the Dallas, Texas area. The pilot program, dubbed "Zipotle," will use Zipline's aircraft, which can hover 300 feet in the air and lower orders to the ground via a robot. This initiative aims to enhance the customer experience and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy consumer base as the fast-casual restaurant industry faces slowing sales. The company suggests that the wide coverage radius of drones could make a national expansion relatively straightforward.</p>

The 37-year-old veteran has participated in four consecutive practices but declined to provide a specific timeline for his return to full play, including his availability for the season opener. Coach Sean McVay described the injury as an aggravated disc but noted that Stafford has looked progressively better throughout the week.

          <h2>Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Report Ordering from Kids' Menus to Save Money</h2>

          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of U.S. adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed citing cost savings and smaller portion sizes as their motivation. This shift in consumer behavior comes as restaurants like McDonald's and Wendy's report slowing sales, particularly among lower-income customers facing economic pressures. The study by Lightspeed Commerce suggests that the simpler options and lower prices on kids' menus are becoming an increasingly attractive choice for adult diners looking to manage their spending on eating out.</p>

          <h2>July Existing Home Sales Rise Unexpectedly as Price Growth Slows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The rise is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, housing inventory reached its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price increases. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point with improved affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

The women's field is led by top seed Aryna Sabalenka, while the men's draw sees top seeds Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on a potential collision course for another Grand Slam final.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic development, high-level officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, US-brokered talks in Paris for the first time in decades. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. The two nations have technically been at war since 1967, and tensions have been high since the fall of the Assad regime. While observers see this as a potential step toward regional stability, the prospect of full normalization of ties remains distant.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., its powerful winds and large size are generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. Storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken and become a post-tropical storm by the weekend.</p>

          <p>During the second quarter, the family offices of several billionaire investors made significant adjustments to their stock portfolios in response to tariff announcements and trade war fears. Filings show that firms for David Tepper, Leon Cooperman, and George Soros sold off casino stocks with exposure to Macao, while some also reduced holdings in major tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet. However, many of these same firms increased their investments in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and TSMC, indicating a long-term bet on the artificial intelligence sector.
