          <p>Veteran defender Kyle Walker has officially completed a move from Manchester City to Burnley, signing a two-year contract with the newly promoted Premier League club. The 35-year-old right-back reunites with head coach Scott Parker, with whom he previously played at Tottenham Hotspur. Walker's transfer follows a successful tenure at Manchester City, where he won 17 trophies, including the historic Treble in 2023. He is Burnley's fifth signing of the summer as the team strengthens its squad for its return to England's top football division.</p>

          <p>A single mother in New Jersey reports being left with a $50,000 car loan after her dealership, Autosmart, allegedly failed to pay off her original loan as promised during a refinancing deal. This case highlights the dangers of auto loan refinancing scams, where fraudulent companies collect payments without settling the original debt, potentially ruining a consumer's credit and risking vehicle repossession. The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers to be wary of such schemes and to thoroughly research dealerships and read all loan documentation carefully before signing. The article advises victims to report fraud to the FTC and their state attorney general. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight key nations within the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day starting in August. This decision, led by major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia, accelerates the reversal of previous voluntary supply cuts. The group cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories, as the basis for their decision. This move continues a trend of gradually increasing output to meet summer demand and stabilize the market, with oil futures settling around $68 per barrel for Brent crude. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The national average interest rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is holding steady, with Bank of America reporting a typical rate of 8.90% after an introductory period. With U.S. homeowners holding a near-record $34 trillion in home equity, HELOCs are an attractive option for accessing cash without refinancing a low-rate primary mortgage. Lenders determine HELOC rates based on the prime rate plus a margin, which varies depending on an applicant's credit score and debt levels. Experts advise consumers to shop around for the best rates and be mindful of introductory offers that convert to higher variable rates later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pasadena community showed up in force to support Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale stand after she became fearful following a recent immigration sweep. An event organized by a community activist on social media drew a large crowd, which bought out hundreds of tamales and raised over $1,500 for the family. The story highlights a trend of American-born children stepping up for their immigrant parents amid heightened federal immigration enforcement. The community's response provided not only financial relief but also a powerful display of solidarity against what many residents described as a climate of fear.</p>

          <p>Hamas has provided a 'positive response' to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal, indicating a readiness to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official stated that Hamas has requested several changes, including a halt to a US-backed aid system and a US guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The US-backed plan reportedly includes a 60-day ceasefire, the staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased aid to Gaza. President Trump commented that a deal could potentially be reached next week, ahead of a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Following a UK Chancellor's tearful appearance in Parliament, this article explores the changing perceptions of crying in the workplace. Executive coaches and career experts argue that showing emotion is no longer a sign of weakness but an indicator of emotional intelligence and humanity. They suggest that employers who respond with compassion and support are more likely to have motivated and loyal staff. While old stigmas may persist, many, including fashion designer Amy Powney, are now advocating for normalizing emotional expression at work, viewing it as a 'superpower' rather than a liability.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans into some of its credit scores this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of services like Affirm and Klarna, which allow shoppers to pay for purchases in installments. For consumers, making on-time BNPL payments could help build credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Lenders support the move, as it provides a more complete picture of a borrower's debt obligations, addressing a previous blind spot in credit assessments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into institutional finance, shifting the focus from price speculation to real-world utility. A major development was Robinhood's launch of on-chain tokenized U.S. stocks, making it the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so. Major financial players like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are also building on Ethereum, valuing its stability, security, and dependability for creating tokenized funds and other assets. Despite market volatility, the trend suggests Ethereum is solidifying its position as the foundational plumbing for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what experts are calling the 'toughest group' for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This means three of the four teams in Group D are ranked in the world's top 11, creating a highly competitive and unpredictable path to the knockout stages. England enters as the defending champion, while the Netherlands won the 2017 tournament. Despite being the lowest-ranked team, Wales has shown it can compete with top sides, setting the stage for a series of high-stakes opening matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex question of whether culture shapes visual perception, examining two recent studies with conflicting findings on optical illusions. One study suggests people from 'carpentered' Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibia, while another study debunks this hypothesis for the famous Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a neuroscientist, posits that perception is an active brain construction, a 'controlled hallucination,' making individual and group differences plausible. He argues for studying perceptual diversity within groups, not just between them, to move beyond simple cultural stereotypes and foster humility about our own way of seeing.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, the Seine River in Paris was officially opened for public swimming on Saturday. The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, as a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. This achievement follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve the river's water quality, which had been contaminated by pollution for decades. The project, championed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo, is seen as a major step in adapting the city to climate change and enhancing the quality of life for residents and tourists.</p>
