          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who alleges she was denied a promotion and later demoted by the Ohio Department of Youth Services due to her heterosexual orientation, with gay candidates being selected instead. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered the opinion, stating that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The court found that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' requirement for majority group plaintiffs to show 'background circumstances' was inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, though it does not guarantee she will win her case. The court's decision clarifies the standard for establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a 90-minute phone call focused on trade, leading to a positive conclusion and the resumption of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. Trump announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in the upcoming meetings. The discussion addressed concerns about rare earth products, and Trump noted that Russia, Ukraine, and Iran were not discussed. Xi Jinping extended an invitation to Trump and his wife to visit China, which Trump reciprocated. The resumption of talks aims to alleviate the trade war between the two countries.

Merz intends to thank Trump for the invitation and present a small gift, with discussions also planned on trade policy, given Germany's significant investment in the U.S., and NATO, where Germany aims to have the strongest conventional army in Europe.

          <p>Nintendo's Switch 2 console launched with special store opening hours and shortages in some markets due to high demand, with the company hoping it will help sustain its share rally. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that 2.2 million people in Japan entered the lottery to purchase the console on launch day, exceeding expectations. While shortages are expected to persist in Japan, there appears to be more availability in the U.K. Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, though analysts predict even higher sales figures.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 5% decline as CEO Elon Musk intensified his criticism of President Donald Trump's spending bill, urging Congress to reject it. Musk's opposition to the bill marks a shift in his stance towards the administration, particularly after his tenure as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite a 22% rally in May, Tesla's shares remain down more than 20% this year. Musk's strong stance against the bill reflects his increasing divergence from the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>This article explores options for medical debt forgiveness, noting that it can take various forms, including hospital financial assistance programs, debt settlement, and careful review of insurance and billing statements. Many nonprofit hospitals are legally required to offer charity care or income-based relief, but patients often need to ask. Debt settlement through negotiation with creditors can also lead to partial forgiveness, though settled debt over $600 may be taxed as income. If forgiveness isn't an option, setting up payment plans or prioritizing debt repayment can help manage the burden.</p>

Autopens have been used by presidents throughout U.S. history to sign documents, letters, and legislation.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aims to overhaul school lunches, targeting ultra-processed foods like Domino's pizza. Domino's 'Smart Slice' initiative, part of the national school-lunch program, provides pizza that meets nutrition standards, but Kennedy advocates for 'real food' instead. Despite efforts to make school meals healthier, some students reject healthier options, leading to food waste. Balancing nutrition with student preferences remains a challenge for school meal programs.</p>

          <p>Every Monday and Wednesday, students at Channelview High School, outside Houston, are treated to Domino‚Äôs for lunch. Delivery drivers from a local branch of the fast-food chain arrive at the school with dozens of pizzas fresh out of the oven, served in Domino‚Äôs-branded cardboard boxes. Children can be picky eaters, but few foods are more universally enticing than freshly cooked pizza‚Äîlet alone from a restaurant students are almost certainly already familiar with. ‚ÄúFor kids to be able to see Oh, they‚Äôre serving Domino‚Äôs, I think it makes a huge difference,‚Äù Tanya Edwards, the district‚Äôs director of nutrition, told me.</p>
