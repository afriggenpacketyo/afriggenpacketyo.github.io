        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London City Lionesses have made history by signing France international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for £1.4 million, setting a new world record fee in women's football. This landmark transfer, which surpasses two other £1 million signings this summer, underscores London City's ambitious strategy, driven by wealthy American owner Michele Kang's substantial investment in the club. Recently promoted to the Women's Super League and operating without affiliation to a men's team, the Lionesses aim to disrupt the traditional hierarchy and become a Champions League contender. Geyoro, a highly experienced midfielder with 103 caps for France, is expected to significantly elevate the team's performance and attract further attention to London City's growing influence in the global football market.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally traded higher after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order formalizing a reduced 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports, down from 27.5%. The order also confirmed an agreement for $550 billion in Japanese investments in US projects, boosting investor confidence. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices saw significant gains, while South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq also climbed. Additionally, several Asian chip stocks surged after Trump indicated plans for tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not moving production to the United States, signaling a strategic shift in global manufacturing.

Clothing, footwear, and online retailers experienced strong growth, while supermarkets and household goods stores saw declines since March. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) acknowledged and revised previous errors in its data collection, aiming for improved reliability of its crucial economic figures. Despite the positive July figures, economists warn that these temporary boosts may not be sustained, with potential tax rises ahead possibly dampening future retail sector performance.

          <p>Kenya's Treasury is in advanced discussions with the Export-Import Bank of China to extend maturities and convert dollar-denominated debt into yuan, aiming to alleviate pressure on its foreign reserves. This potential shift, particularly for loans secured for the Standard Gauge Railway, could halve interest rates from 6.37% in US dollars to approximately 3% in yuan. Kenyan Treasury Minister John Mbadi described the proposed currency swap as a "win-win" situation, leveraging the difference between secured overnight financing rates and yuan rates. This move reflects a broader trend among nations seeking to diversify their foreign currency holdings and reduce reliance on the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>
