          <p>England achieved a decisive 65-run victory against New Zealand in their second T20 match, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. The win was powered by a formidable batting partnership between Phil Salt, who scored 85, and captain Harry Brook, who added a destructive 78. Their efforts propelled England to a total of 236-4, the highest T20 international score at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. New Zealand's chase fell short as they were bowled out for 171, with England's Adil Rashid taking four wickets.</p>

The move follows the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea left the team in 18th place in the league table. Dyche, the former manager of Everton and Burnley, has emerged as the leading candidate for the position. The club hopes to finalize the appointment quickly to address its poor start to the season, having won only one of its first eight league games.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that revised medical advice from 2015, which recommends introducing peanut products to infants as early as four months, has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies. This guidance reversed decades of previous recommendations to delay feeding allergenic foods to young children. Research published in the journal Pediatrics analyzed health records and found a significant decline in peanut allergy diagnoses among young children after the guidelines were implemented. The findings provide real-world evidence that early introduction is an effective public health strategy for reducing the prevalence of this life-threatening allergy.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, is reportedly planning to order an additional 15 F-35 fighter jets from the American manufacturer Lockheed Martin. This purchase would be in addition to the 35 jets already requested, as Germany continues to increase its military expenditure in response to regional security threats. The advanced aircraft are intended to replace Germany's aging Tornado fleet and are capable of carrying U.S. nuclear weapons stored in the country under NATO agreements. The move reflects a significant expansion of Germany's defense budget and a strengthening of its military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The fourth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee has officially begun in Beijing, accompanied by a significant increase in security measures. State media confirmed the start of the high-level political meeting, which is a key event for setting national policy direction. In the area surrounding the Jingxi Hotel, a traditional venue for such gatherings, a heavy police presence was observed, with roads cordoned off and numerous police vehicles stationed nearby. These plenums are crucial for the party to consolidate its agenda and make important decisions regarding the country's future political and economic trajectory.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for students aged 16 and over. These courses are intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 education. The proposal is part of a broader effort to elevate vocational training alongside traditional A-levels and newer T-levels. Additionally, the government plans a new "stepping stone" qualification to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSEs in maths and English.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his strategic flexibility in a 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite being without star receiver Puka Nacua. McVay dramatically shifted from his usual offensive scheme, which heavily favors three-receiver sets, to a formation using three tight ends. This unexpected tactical change proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns on fewer than 200 passing yards. The performance highlights McVay's ability to adapt his game plan to his available personnel, proving his offense can remain potent even when missing a key player.</p>

Following the news, Akeso's Hong Kong-listed shares initially rose but later closed down amid a broader sell-off in the sector. Analysts noted the drug's lower toxicity and advanced development position it favorably, potentially putting it years ahead of competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

Preliminary results show Paz securing 54% of the vote, marking a significant political shift after two decades of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Paz's victory was fueled by voter frustration with a severe economic crisis, including a U.S. dollar shortage and soaring inflation. His campaign, bolstered by a popular anti-corruption running mate, appealed to voters who were disillusioned with the ruling party but wary of his rival's more radical free-market proposals.</p>
