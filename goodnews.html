          <p>President Trump is set to host a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army in Washington, D.C., marking the capital's first major military parade in over three decades. Military parades in the U.S. have historically been rare, often celebrating the end of wars or the return of military personnel, with the last major parade marking the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Presidential inaugural parades have also included military personnel, particularly during the Cold War, but such displays became less common after the Vietnam War era. The upcoming parade has drawn criticism for its cost and perceived self-aggrandizement, while supporters view it as a fitting tribute to military service and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>USA Fencing has announced changes to its policies regarding the national anthem and hosting events in states with anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The organization will now give equal consideration to all 50 states when selecting host cities for national tournaments, using a rubric that scores bids on cost, safety, and travel convenience. The national anthem will now be required to be played at every event, effective at the 2025 Summer Nationals and reviewed annually. These changes come after criticism of the previous policies, including from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who argued they created politically-determined winners and losers and contradicted USA Fencing‚Äôs duty to develop interest and participation throughout the United States.</p>

          <p>Meta's AI app, launched in April, is facing privacy concerns as users unknowingly share wacky and personal prompts publicly. While Meta AI chats are private by default, users can publicly share prompts through a four-step process, including a pre-post preview and an option to hide posts. To protect privacy, users can adjust settings to prevent their prompts from being shared on Facebook and Instagram. Users can also manage their information to make all public prompts visible only to themselves and delete their prompt history. Meta has been increasing its investment in AI to compete with industry leaders like Google and OpenAI.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a shortage of rare earth minerals, crucial for automobile production, forced the company to temporarily shut down a plant last month. China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, supplies about 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals, and has imposed export controls amid trade tensions with the U.S. Although the U.S. and China recently reached an agreement to resume regular exports of rare earths, Ford is still facing challenges in securing these materials. The cumbersome administrative process for exporting rare earths from China has caused disruptions, with applications sometimes not being approved quickly, presenting a potential issue for Ford.</p>

          <p>With gold prices poised to break another record, both beginner and veteran investors should consider strategic moves. Beginners should consider getting invested now, looking to fractional gold to enter the market, and avoiding the temptation to sell quickly. Veterans should hold steady, consider buying more if gold is not at the recommended limit of 10% of their overall portfolio, and remember the initial reasons for investing. Speaking with a financial advisor or gold company who can offer more personalized guidance is advised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, indicating a swell of optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs in recent weeks. The resurgence of shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of worsening sentiment, with improvement reflected across all demographics. Year-ahead inflation expectations dropped sharply, though they remain above current levels. Trump has dialed back some of his steepest tariffs, easing costs imposed upon importers, and a trade agreement between the U.S. and China slashed tit-for-tat tariffs, triggering a surge in the stock market.</p>

          <p>Michael Ramos, the former district attorney for San Bernardino County, has agreed to a six-month suspension from practicing law in California for allegedly destroying evidence in a 2017 corruption case. The case involved corruption charges against county officials and a developer, with Ramos accused of deleting emails and text messages relevant to the litigation. A U.S. magistrate judge concluded that Ramos had a duty to preserve the evidence and found his excuses unacceptable. The suspension agreement has been approved by the State Bar Court and sent to the California Supreme Court for approval.</p>

After the first set, the 22-year-old took a medical timeout because she had been experiencing back spasms for the previous few months.

The Smithsonian Institution initially rebuffed Trump's attempt, asserting its independence, but Sajet has since stepped down. Trump's attack focused on her Democratic political donations and rejection of a pro-Trump painting. Sajet had been the National Portrait Gallery's first female director, appointed in 2013.</p>

          <p>Despite a trend toward moderation in drinking habits, songs about drinking remain popular and culturally relevant. A new compilation of boozy tunes culled from the Lomax Archive, titled *Drinking in Here*, showcases the enduring appeal of these songs. Drinking songs are about camaraderie and shared experiences, and continue to be relevant in contemporary music. The best drinking songs are self-deprecating and self-aware, acknowledging the potential downsides of drinking while still celebrating the experience.</p>
