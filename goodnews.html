        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices hover near record highs and expectations of further increases grow, both beginner and experienced investors may want to consider adjusting their strategies. Beginners should consider investing now, even at high prices, as waiting for a lower entry point may be futile. Fractional gold investments can make entry more accessible, and investors should resist the temptation to sell quickly, viewing gold as a long-term inflation hedge. Veteran investors should hold steady, consider buying more to reach a 10% portfolio allocation, and remember the initial reasons for investing, consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, signaling increased optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. The resurgence ended six months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping sharply from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, political party, and geographic region. The rollbacks of tariffs between the U.S. and China and on goods from Mexico and Canada are factors in the sentiment improvement, though some tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, with a score of 6-2, 6-4.

Despite a strong start in the second set, leading by a double break, she couldn't maintain the lead against Zheng's powerful game. Raducanu, who also played two doubles matches, attributed her performance to playing five matches in a short period and plans to rest her back.</p>

Anna Lomax Wood notes that her father and grandfather enjoyed alcohol but did not drink while working. Experts suggest that the best drinking songs are self-deprecating and self-aware, reflecting a cultural universality of singing about getting tipsy.</p>

          <p>Debt settlement is a process where you negotiate with your creditors to pay less than the full amount you owe. It typically applies to unsecured debts and is often used as a last resort when a borrower can't afford to pay off their debt in full. The process typically takes 24 to 48 months on average, depending on how much debt you have and how much you're able to save. Debt settlement can offer real advantages, especially for borrowers who have exhausted other options. (not investment advice)</p>

Following discussions, the U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S. Ford is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.</p>
