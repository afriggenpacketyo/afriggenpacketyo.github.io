          <p>Warren Buffett announced that Greg Abel will succeed him as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, marking the end of an era for the company. Buffett, who transformed a failing textile mill into a conglomerate with a market cap of nearly $1.2 trillion, will remain involved to assist Abel. Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will continue Buffett's value investing style and deploy Berkshire's $347 billion cash reserves when opportunities arise. Buffett emphasized his confidence in Abel's management and plans to retain his shares in the company, adding that the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Abel's management than his.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Albanese's re-election as Australia's prime minister was significantly influenced by global turmoil stemming from President Trump's policies, which bolstered anti-Trump sentiment among Australian voters. Despite Albanese's measured approach and avoidance of direct criticism, the negative perception of Trump's policies, particularly his tariff decisions, played a role in the election outcome. Voters, concerned about the cost-of-living crisis, rejected Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, due to his alignment with some of Trump's ideas. The election results underscore a preference for sensible, centrist politics over policies perceived as erratic or poorly considered.</p>

          <p>Native American women are reclaiming their cultural heritage by reviving the tradition of facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, among southeastern Indigenous nations. The Inchunwa Project is at the forefront of this revitalization, hosting retreats and workshops to educate and empower individuals to receive and promote these ancestral markings. Receiving inchunwa is a deeply personal and spiritual experience, reflecting a commitment to community, heritage, and setting the groundwork for being a good ancestor. The inchunwa symbolizes personal promises, honors lost siblings, and acknowledges the thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women, as well as symbolizing the tribe's living culture.</p>

          <p>Helen Schulman's essay explores the evolving dynamics of marriage as couples age, reflecting on her 33-year relationship with her husband. She humorously notes that she now hates him less, attributing this to time and his industry's collapse, which allowed him to be more present. Schulman acknowledges the challenges of balancing career and family, particularly the unequal distribution of domestic labor, while also recognizing the luck they had. The essay concludes with a sense of gratitude and savoring the present with her husband.</p>
