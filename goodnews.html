          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has resumed first-team training after holding constructive discussions with the club's coaching staff. The 28-year-old had previously left the team's pre-season training camp in Portugal, expressing a strong desire to secure a transfer to Newcastle for the opportunity to play in the Champions League. While talks have eased immediate tensions, Wissa still seeks a move away from the club. Brentford is reportedly open to a sale but is holding out for a higher transfer fee than Newcastle's current offer of £25 million plus add-ons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elaine Castillo's new novel, "Moderation," is reviewed as a poignant exploration of how technology affects emotional and social lives. The book follows Girlie Delmundo, a Filipino American woman who works as a content moderator for a major tech company, forcing her to view horrific material to support her family. The reviewer praises the novel for its sharp wit and its depiction of dissociation as a coping mechanism in the modern world, where digital distractions offer a constant escape from grief and pain. This article highlights how "tech novels" like this are crucial for examining the profound shifts in human experience brought on by our relationship with technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from the peak prices of 2022, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited inventory, creating a divided national housing market where buyer and seller experiences vary greatly by region.

          <p>The United States is set to auction the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht seized from a sanctioned Russian billionaire in 2022. The vessel, valued at over $300 million, was impounded as part of "Operation KleptoCapture," a task force targeting oligarchs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The auction requires bidders to have a net worth of at least $500 million and place a $10 million deposit. A holding company tied to the yacht disputes its ownership by the sanctioned individual, claiming it belongs to another non-sanctioned Russian, and has warned potential buyers of future legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh Pros and Cons of Reverse Mortgages Versus Selling a Home for Retirees</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, accessing home equity is a significant financial decision. This article explores the choice between selling a home and obtaining a reverse mortgage. Experts suggest a reverse mortgage can be a great option for those who wish to stay in their home and need supplemental income to cover rising living costs, as it provides funds without a monthly repayment obligation. However, it reduces the inheritance for heirs and comes with fees. Selling is recommended for those wanting to relocate or downsize, but market conditions and tax implications must be carefully considered. (not investment advice)</p>

The author, who developed a fear of flying after a turbulent flight, describes the class, which includes practical advice, breathing techniques, and a session on a stationary airplane. The essay explores the psychology behind aerophobia, noting it often stems from a lack of control and can be triggered by life changes. While the class did not completely cure the author's anxiety, it provided valuable tools and a sense of community, reframing the fear as a manageable challenge.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with U.S. same-store sales growing 2.5% and reversing previous declines. The rebound was attributed to successful promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps. However, executives expressed ongoing concern about the economic health of low-income consumers, whose visits have declined. The company is exploring ways to make its core menu more affordable to re-engage this critical customer base, acknowledging a "bifurcated" consumer environment. (not investment advice)</p>
