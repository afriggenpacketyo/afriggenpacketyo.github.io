          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China, but details remain scarce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned "substantial progress" in Geneva trade talks, hinting at a de-escalation in the trade war that has affected the global economy since President Trump's tariff announcement in April. The Chinese officials also spoke positively, suggesting that a statement would be released soon. This potential easing of tensions could offer relief to the global economy, which has been strained by ongoing trade disputes. Optimism that this trade deal will be beneficial to all parties is high, but there is still much to be seen.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, raising ethical questions and prompting a Government Accountability Office investigation. While Qatar's Media Attach√© acknowledged the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use, they disputed reports of an immediate gift. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an ethics review, citing potential violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, would be donated to the future Trump presidential library after he leaves office, and if Trump accepts the plane, the gift would be a new precedent.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "Thunderbolts" and Ryan Coogler's "Sinners" continued to lead the North American box office charts this weekend, despite facing competition from new releases. "Thunderbolts" secured the top spot with $33.1 million, while "Sinners" followed closely behind. The overall box office performance has seen a boost, with year-to-date figures rising approximately 16% compared to last year, driven by successes like "A Minecraft Movie," "Sinners," and "Thunderbolts." However, the cumulative box office remains more than 32% lower compared to 2019, which shows a need for improvement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Sir Keir Starmer, is considering plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents as part of an overhaul of the immigration system. Migrants may have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years. The move is part of a wider effort to "tighten up" what the prime minister called a "broken" immigration system. The changes will also end automatic settlement in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least ten years before they can apply for settle status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship.</p>

Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier, was captured on October 7, 2023. The release of Alexander has been negotiated directly between US officials and Hamas leaders.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in US-China trade talks held in Geneva, with details expected to be announced soon. The talks, the first since steep tariffs were levied by the US in January, were described by President Trump as engendering a "total reset" in the relationship. While specifics remain unclear, the progress suggests a potential de-escalation in the trade war, which has negatively impacted both economies. The World Trade Organization has also called for both nations to continue developing practical solutions to mitigate tensions and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system.</p>

          <p>Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as a part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. The Israeli prime minister's office said it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander "as a gesture towards the Americans" and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages. Hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war, something that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

Any indication of a trade truce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn. Mr. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Economists have warned that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession.</p>
