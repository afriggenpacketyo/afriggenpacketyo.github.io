        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is implementing another round of layoffs, affecting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of CEO Elliott Hill's strategy to realign the business and reignite growth. This follows a larger 2% staff reduction in February and aims to shift the company's focus back to sports and culture, moving away from a previous lifestyle-oriented segmentation. Hill's vision involves organizing into "sport-obsessed teams" to drive innovation across Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. While the company expects sales and profit declines to moderate, this restructuring reflects ongoing efforts to reverse a decline in sales and win back wholesale partners.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce experienced a massive 200% surge in jersey sales on Tuesday, according to Fanatics, the NFL's official online sportswear retailer, following the announcement of his engagement to pop superstar Taylor Swift. This marks Kelce's most significant sales day since the Super Bowl, underscoring the immense influence of Swift's fanbase. Their high-profile romance, which began in July 2023, has consistently generated significant public interest and boosted Kelce's merchandise, with previous sales spikes occurring after Swift's attendance at Chiefs games and their record-setting podcast appearance. The article notes the couple's joint Instagram post about their nuptials also broke records, demonstrating their combined cultural impact.</p>

          <p>Nvidia revealed that two unidentified "direct customers" accounted for a significant 39% of its revenue in the July quarter, raising concerns about client concentration for the chipmaker. "Customer A" contributed 23% and "Customer B" 16% of total revenue, a notable increase from the previous year. While large cloud service providers comprise about 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue, the identities of these top direct customers remain a mystery, potentially being original design manufacturers, distributors, or system integrators. This article highlights analysts' focus on cloud capital expenditure to model Nvidia's future growth and the company's forecast of a $3 to $4 trillion AI infrastructure market by the end of the decade.

          <p>A cybersecurity expert recommends using unique email aliases for online shopping to protect privacy, reduce spam, and prevent companies from extensively tracking online behavior. This article explains that a single email address acts as a "skeleton key" for companies to build comprehensive behavioral profiles, link purchases, and potentially facilitate fraud after data breaches. By creating a unique, forwarded alias for each website, users can disrupt tracking systems and identify which sites may have compromised their data if spam occurs. This simple practice fragments digital identity, reduces the "blast radius" of breaches, and encourages more deliberate online engagement.</p>

This article explains that while DOT owns the building, its daily operations and commercial aspects were previously outsourced. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited the station's disrepair and aims to make it "safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost." The move comes amidst the Trump administration's broader efforts to assert control over D.C. management and follows officials' criticisms of crime and homelessness at the station.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For most retirees, a reverse mortgage typically does not impact Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility, as these are based on earnings history and not assets. This article clarifies that Social Security payments remain unchanged, and Medicare coverage is unaffected regardless of home equity use. However, it warns that need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid can be affected. Large lump-sum payouts from a reverse mortgage could push recipients over asset limits for SSI, while unused funds might impact Medicaid eligibility. Consulting with a financial advisor and a HUD-approved housing counselor is crucial to navigate these nuances and avoid unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits poetry as an "analog solution" for mindful living, offering a deeper immersion in the present moment than modern wellness devices. It argues that poetry, unlike platforms aimed at optimizing human versions, connects with the "resonant sources" of life—family, rage, love, fears—to address the root cause of unwellness: feeling disconnected from one's own life. Citing poet Linda Gregg's work, the article illustrates how her style, often drawing from Greek landscapes, creates a sense of satisfaction and balance through careful language and the omission of verbs. Gregg's poetry invites readers to cultivate self-awareness, aligning them with their surroundings and their own breath.</p>

This article explains that tariffs are complicating the retailer's turnaround, potentially causing shoppers to delay purchases and affecting categories like appliances and home theater. The company is responding by sharpening price points, adjusting merchandise, and expanding in-store staffing with vendor partners, while also investing in new customer experiences and a third-party marketplace.

This article explains the grants, funded by a £650 million scheme, are automatically applied at the point of sale for eligible cars costing up to £37,000. While many drivers cite upfront costs and charging infrastructure as barriers, the scheme seeks to make EVs more affordable and help meet the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales.
