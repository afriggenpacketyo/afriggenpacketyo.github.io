        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives moved forward with voting on President Trump's domestic policy bill, following an all-night session and the unveiling of an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The legislation, which includes tax, defense, and energy priorities, has faced numerous setbacks due to internal party disagreements over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and renewable energy credits. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated changes, including adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, to secure enough votes for passage in the House. However, the bill is expected to encounter significant resistance in the Senate, where Republicans are likely to seek further modifications, potentially disrupting the delicate balance achieved in the House.

          <p>Mexico intends to maintain neutrality in the ongoing tariff war between the United States and China, while also pursuing increased trade opportunities with Beijing.

The country aims to address trade imbalances by increasing agricultural exports to China. This stance reflects Mexico's broader "universal mentality" of seeking cooperation and business opportunities with multiple countries, rather than choosing sides in geopolitical conflicts.

          <p>Juan Soto, the New York Mets' $765 million slugger, has faced scrutiny despite a generally solid start to his career with the team. After signing a lucrative 15-year contract, Soto's performance has been subject to viral stories and negative rumors, including concerns about his hustle and clubhouse demeanor. While his adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS+) remains above the league average, it hasn't met the extraordinary expectations set by his past performance. Despite the pressure, analysts suggest that Soto's underlying statistics indicate he will soon return to his elite form, and that fans should remain patient as he adjusts to playing in New York.</p>

          <p>New research has identified the genetic mutation responsible for the orange coat color in cats, solving a long-standing mystery in feline genetics. Scientists from Stanford University and Japan‚Äôs Kyushu University collaborated, collecting DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners to pinpoint the specific alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene. The mutation activates this gene in pigment cells, leading to the orange hue. This discovery sheds light on hormonal signaling pathways and has broader implications for understanding cell behavior in various animals, including humans.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize a deal transferring the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction. The legal action was brought by two Chagossian women who argue that the government failed to properly consult with the Chagossian people, whose families were displaced from the islands in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years. The court will hear the case again to determine the next steps.</p>

          <p>The Short Shorts Film Festival & Asia, starting next week, is highlighting tales of diversity and dystopia. The festival's theme is "creative active generative." Organizers hope the festival will spark new relationships between audiences and films, and creators and businesses. The festival features five competitions whose winners will receive a prize of 600,000 yen each and are eligible for the following year's Academy Awards. This year's films include French production "Find The Boy", German film "Transformation", and "One Day I Will Hug You".</p>
