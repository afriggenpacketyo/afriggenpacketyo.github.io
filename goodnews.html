          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war, following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. While details remain scarce, Bessent indicated that an agreement had been reached, with further information to be released soon. Both sides have expressed optimism, with President Trump praising the talks for engendering a 'total reset' in the relationship and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng acknowledging 'important progress.'
