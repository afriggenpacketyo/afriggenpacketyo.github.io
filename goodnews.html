          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated the club's intention to retain 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong amidst interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca dismissed suggestions of the player's frustration, emphasizing Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for the team and outlining a long-term plan for his development at Stamford Bridge. The manager expressed his personal admiration for the young player and sees his future as being integral to the club's success, suggesting a loan would only be considered if it aligns with his development.</p>

          <p>A study conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets including rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, and found that those who adhered to such a diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. While researchers note that further study is needed, the findings suggest that the diet's components, like omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being.</p>

Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 escape, which authorities said went unnoticed for hours, has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management, while officials have also arrested at least 16 individuals accused of aiding the escaped inmates during their time on the run.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that he is not giving up on Apple, even as the stock faces challenges from U.S. tariffs on China and a perceived lack of groundbreaking AI developments. Cramer acknowledged the current negativity but argued that tough times have historically been great buying opportunities for the company's stock. He pointed to Apple's strong earnings growth rate compared to the S&P 500 and his faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership as key reasons for his continued confidence. (not investment advice)</p>
