          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home tool for cervical cancer screening in the United States, offering a more convenient alternative to the traditional Pap smear. The device, developed by Teal Health, involves a self-collected vaginal sample that is mailed to a lab for HPV testing. Studies have shown that at-home screening is as effective as in-office screening and is preferred by many women. The approval aims to increase screening rates and reduce the number of cervical cancer cases and deaths, particularly among underserved populations.</p>
