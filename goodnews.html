          <p>Early voter turnout in California's special election for Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw congressional districts, has exceeded expectations. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and non-party preference voters, matching turnout levels seen in the 2024 presidential election. Former President Obama has endorsed the measure, emphasizing its significance for democracy nationwide. While the high turnout appears to favor Proposition 50 supporters, millions of ballots are still outstanding, and Republicans express concerns about potential suppression of their early vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are making significant strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread cancer. A clinical trial involving 51 women with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form, has shown remarkable results, with only two recurrences after seven years, far below the expected rate. The team identified and attacked these lurking cells in bone marrow using specific drugs. This breakthrough offers immense hope for future treatments, with plans for larger trials and potential application to other cancers.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. A relative alerted authorities when they didn't return as expected, prompting a search. The son's quick thinking to use the boat's washed-up marine radio for a mayday call ultimately led to their rescue by helicopter. While one family member was in critical condition, the others were stable, highlighting the importance of emergency equipment and quick action in survival situations.</p>

          <p>Starting next year, NHS health checks in England for women aged 40 to 74 will officially include questions about menopause and its symptoms. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice and support, including treatments like hormone replacement therapy, hot-flush medications, and counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes this move will bring menopause into mainstream health discussions and improve support, addressing the long-standing issue of women suffering in silence. Campaigners, however, stress the need to improve uptake, especially in marginalized communities.</p>
