          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, overcoming a legal challenge from Exxon Mobil regarding valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The International Chamber of Commerce's ruling sided with Chevron, affirming a long-standing industry practice that asset-level rights of refusal do not apply in corporate-level mergers and acquisitions. This significant win provides Chevron with access to the vast Stabroek Block oil reserves, where Hess holds a 30% stake. Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, though he anticipates some headcount reductions as the companies integrate for efficiency.</p>

          <p>Consumers' fears about tariff-induced inflation have receded, with the University of Michigan's July Survey of Consumers showing inflation outlooks for both one- and five-year horizons tumbling to their lowest levels since February 2025. Overall consumer sentiment increased slightly to 61.8, its highest point since February. Despite this improvement, survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation increases. This article highlights a shift in consumer expectations following President Trump's earlier tariff announcements, although new tariffs on individual products may still raise future price concerns.

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival, under artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser, presents a program that reflects contemporary global crises, particularly power struggles and bloodshed. The festival features numerous operas, including Handel's "Giulio Cesare" and Verdi's "Macbeth," which illuminate the inevitable decline of rulers and offer audiences "spaces of change." With 222,500 tickets available for 174 performances, the event maintains its century-old principle of offering something for everyone. Despite recent controversies, the festival continues to showcase a diverse array of artists, including many Russian artists who have left Putin's regime, alongside Ukrainian voices.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering competitive interest rates that surpass the current inflation rate, making them an attractive option for savers. These investments are generally safe, with FDIC or NCUA insurance covering balances up to $250,000, allowing individuals to lock in high returns for a fixed term. Online banks often provide the best CD rates, and short-term CDs (around six months to one year) are currently yielding higher interest due to an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to maximize earnings while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance interest rates remain elevated, posing challenges for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, though a strong credit score can help secure better terms. As of July 18, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.75%, with 15-year rates at 5.95%. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could offer some relief to borrowers in the near future. To improve chances of qualifying for a great rate, individuals are advised to strengthen their credit profiles and compare offers from various lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have dropped their criminal investigation into the Irish language rap trio Kneecap's performance at Glastonbury, citing insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The group had faced weeks of controversy and an inquiry following comments made on stage, which they characterized as a "celebration of love and solidarity" and "political policing intimidation." This decision comes after public debate and a prior terror charge against one member, which he denies. The BBC notably did not livestream their performance amidst the controversy.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has surged to over $38 per ounce, its highest in more than a decade, prompting gold investors to consider a switch. While silver offers similar portfolio protections at a fraction of gold's price, a complete transition from gold to silver is generally not recommended. Experts advise limiting precious metal investments to about 10% of an overall portfolio to maintain diversification. The current rise in silver prices provides a timely opportunity for investors to reassess their precious metal allocations, rather than making an all-or-nothing move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican envoy has indicated that Chinese-funded factories operating in Mexico are highly unlikely to lose their preferential treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), despite ongoing trade rivalry between China and the U.S. Revisions to the USMCA, expected next year, are anticipated to focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than introducing restrictions on specific countries. This suggests that Chinese companies manufacturing in Mexico will likely continue to benefit from the trade deal, highlighting Mexico's strategic position amidst complex global trade dynamics and supply chain considerations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's significant investment in attacking talent, including the expected £65 million transfer of Bryan Mbeumo, has intensified questions about their need for a dedicated central striker. Despite spending over £120 million on new forwards, most are positioned behind a main striker, raising concerns about Rasmus Hojlund's goal-scoring consistency. The article analyzes whether United will pursue another number nine, considering financial constraints and Hojlund's unproven prolificacy. Mbeumo's versatility and high work-rate are seen as valuable additions, aimed at improving the team's overall firepower and consistency in front of goal.</p>
