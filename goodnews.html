          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any reduction in consumer demand despite the tariffs implemented by President Trump. Jassy made these remarks during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, noting that they also haven't seen significant increases in average selling prices yet. While Amazon acknowledged that tariffs and trade policies could potentially affect their future guidance, rival retailer Walmart previously cautioned about possible consumer price hikes due to tariffs, prompting a response from Trump to absorb the costs. Optimism around the economy is still uncertain, and consumers are likely to be impacted by the tariffs in the near future.</p>

The Senate's progress on stablecoin legislation and Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 are viewed positively for the crypto industry.

Microsoft's digital crimes unit seized over 1,300 domains and worked with other tech companies to disrupt the malware's infrastructure.

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the current market distractions, including presidential actions, tax bill battles, and the Federal Reserve's indecision on interest rates. He argues that these distractions create buying opportunities for investors with a long-term perspective. Cramer emphasizes the importance of focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and trustworthy CEOs, rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. He also notes that the action in the 10-year Treasury is putting more pressure on the S&P futures than he has seen in some time, hurting all stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill allows workers to deduct "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, contingent on reporting them. While some believe the measure will provide relief to hard-working Americans, others argue that it will only benefit a narrow subset of the workforce and could lead to income misclassification.
