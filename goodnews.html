The 22-year-old defeated Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final, showcasing his powerful serve with 16 aces. This victory is Shelton's third career title and will elevate him to a career-high ranking of sixth in the world.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, marking the fourth court ruling to block the Trump administration's order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The order sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to win on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that limited nationwide injunctions but left open other legal avenues for challenges.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japan's SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. This success was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, their largest since 2021, thanks to strong performance from portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other SoftBank-backed companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an Australian politician convicted last month of sexually assaulting two young men, has resigned from the New South Wales parliament. The resignation came just hours before a scheduled vote to expel him, following the dismissal of his legal challenge to remain in office. Ward, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, had argued that his expulsion would be an "affront to democracy." His departure from office means he will no longer receive a parliamentary salary and triggers a by-election for the seat he held as an independent.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order halting further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in Florida's Everglades. The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day order prevents new work, such as paving, which experts testified could cause contaminated runoff. The state of Florida has vowed to fight the ruling, which represents a temporary victory for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 21:06:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer photographed the female butterfly at Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, with experts confirming its identity. The species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant ecological event, it is uncertain if the butterfly will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <h2>Singles Increasingly Abandon Dating Apps for In-Person Connection Events</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and seeking romantic connections at in-person events. Companies like Date Cincy are capitalizing on this trend, hosting events for people experiencing "swipe fatigue." According to Eventbrite, attendance at singles events rose by 42% last year, while the value of apps like Bumble has plummeted. Users cite a desire for genuine, face-to-face interaction and frustration with the misrepresentation that can occur on digital profiles, fueling a return to more old-fashioned methods of meeting people.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The celebrity chimp was later discovered alive in a small cage following a tip from the documentary's director to PETA. The animal rights organization praised the sentencing, stating Haddix is now getting "a taste of the suffering she inflicted on animals."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with strong sales growth but profitability squeezed by rising beef prices. Revenue increased by 12.8% to $1.51 billion, beating estimates, but earnings per share fell short of expectations. The company saw a robust 5.8% increase in same-store sales, driven by higher customer traffic, a trend that has continued into the third quarter. To offset the commodity inflation, management plans a modest menu price increase later this year, navigating the challenge of maintaining its value proposition. (not investment advice)</p>
