          <p>China is preparing a mission to test its planetary defense capabilities by attempting to alter the orbit of an asteroid. Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the nation's lunar exploration program, announced that the kinetic impact demonstration mission is planned to be carried out within the year. The mission will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers from Earth, utilizing an impactor spacecraft to strike it while an observer craft records the effects. The goal is to achieve a small but measurable orbital deflection of 3 to 5 centimeters, providing crucial data for developing strategies to defend Earth from potential asteroid threats in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices reach new record highs, driven by economic uncertainty and central bank purchases, investors are increasingly drawn to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Financial experts recommend gaining exposure through low-cost and liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, rather than purchasing coins or bars, which involve higher costs. While gold performs well in low-interest-rate environments and during geopolitical strife, financial advisors generally suggest limiting such investments to a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a diversified portfolio.

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway premiere, the musical 'Hamilton' is being re-examined for its cultural relevance and legacy in a changed political climate. Initially celebrated as a groundbreaking, progressive work intertwined with the optimism of the Obama era, the show's perception has evolved through the Trump administration and a more critical lens on its historical depictions. A theater expert notes that while the musical's first act reflected a hopeful vision of America, the nation now seems to be living in its more polarized and fractured second act. Despite critiques regarding its portrayal of the Founding Fathers and slavery, the article suggests the show's core as a tragedy about political rivalry and division remains powerfully resonant today.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first Millennial saint, a move embraced by the Catholic Church to connect with younger generations. Known for his computer skills, which he used to create a website documenting Eucharistic miracles, Acutis is presented as both a normal, tech-savvy teen and a deeply devout mystic. This dual identity appeals to different factions within the Church: those seeking to modernize and relate to contemporary life, and those drawn to more traditional, supernatural aspects of the faith. His rapid path to sainthood reflects both a concerted effort by his family and the Church's strategic aim to present a youthful, modern yet devout role model.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on how to protect an inheritance from being considered community property in the event of a divorce. It emphasizes that while an inheritance is typically separate property, its legal status can change if it is commingled with marital assets. The article advises against placing inherited funds into joint accounts or using them for shared expenses like a home mortgage. It also explains the different legal treatments for IRAs and employer-sponsored 401(k)s in divorce proceedings, noting that rules for 401(k)s under ERISA often grant automatic rights to a surviving spouse unless a formal waiver is signed.

          <p>The US Open women's final will feature a compelling matchup between world number one Aryna Sabalenka and American Amanda Anisimova, with both players seeking redemption after recent Grand Slam disappointments. Sabalenka, the defending champion, has lost in two major finals this year, while Anisimova is looking to overcome the memory of a harsh 6-0, 6-0 loss in her first major final at Wimbledon. The match pits two of the sport's biggest hitters against each other, with their emotional resilience and ability to handle pressure likely to be as crucial as their powerful ball-striking. Having split their two previous meetings this year, the final promises a tense battle for a coveted Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>The 369th Infantry Regiment, a majority-Black unit from World War I known as the 'Harlem Hellfighters,' has been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. The award recognizes the soldiers' renowned bravery and extended service on the front lines, which occurred despite facing intense racism and segregation within the U.S. military at the time. The ceremony comes amid a broader national debate, influenced by the Trump administration, over how American history is remembered and taught. The medal will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution, serving as a permanent tribute to a legacy that was largely ignored for decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to changes in federal vaccine policy under the Trump administration, several states are taking independent action to ensure access to COVID-19 shots and create their own scientific guidance. New York has declared a disaster emergency, while states like Massachusetts are mandating insurer coverage for state-recommended vaccines. On the west coast, California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii have formed the West Coast Health Alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations based on scientific evidence, free from perceived political interference. These actions are driven by concerns over budget cuts at federal agencies, firings of expert advisors, and recent FDA restrictions on fall COVID shot eligibility, which states fear are based on ideology rather than science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is causing a noticeable shift in consumer grocery spending, creating a new challenge for the snack food industry. Recent research indicates that within six months, users of these drugs reduce overall grocery spending and trade ultra-processed snacks for healthier options, impacting sales of traditional tailgating foods. In response, retailers are beginning to adapt by reformulating ready-made meals with higher protein and more vegetables. While the high cost of the drugs currently limits a large-scale market shift, experts note that even as users' overall calorie intake decreases, the craving for indulgent snacks often remains, suggesting a future of more moderate consumption rather than complete elimination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare move for the U.S. government, the Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in semiconductor giant Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. This action, which converts previous grants under the CHIPS Act into equity, is not a response to an economic crisis but a strategic effort to bolster domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge microchips amid fierce competition with China for AI dominance. The goal is to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC, especially given geopolitical risks. While government backing has proven successful in other countries, experts caution that this level of involvement carries risks, including potential political pressure on the company's business decisions.</p>

A former math and chemistry teacher, Borralho co-founded the 'Fighting Nerds' gym, which features a mural of Albert Einstein alongside fighting legends. The team's ethos is to encourage people to embrace their unique interests, with Borralho aiming to counter the bullying he experienced for his "nerdy" pursuits as a youth. He believes his success in the UFC, where he is undefeated, stems from his high fight IQ and strategic planning rather than pure physicality, aspiring to be remembered as one of the most intelligent fighters in the sport's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne with no other young male heirs, the event has reignited the national debate over Japan's male-only succession law. This rule prevents the emperor's daughter, Princess Aiko, from inheriting the throne, despite public support for female succession. With Japan's imperial family shrinking, conservatives have proposed solutions like readmitting distant male relatives to the royal line, while others advocate for allowing female members to retain their status after marriage to continue official duties.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, but the centennial is shadowed by political controversy. Germany's far-right AfD party has criticized the event, denouncing the modernist movement for promoting "globalist uniformity" and demanding a critical reassessment, echoing the Nazi party's condemnation of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before shutting it down in 1933. Despite these attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its year-long celebration, which focuses on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design. The foundation's director notes that while the campaign has brought unwanted attention, it has also rallied significant public support for the institution.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the experience of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan and discovering the deep connection between the team and its city's identity. The author, previously uninterested in sports, was initiated into the "Bills Mafia" and found that supporting the team is synonymous with understanding Buffalo itself. The city and the team share a narrative of resilience, hard work, and being perpetually on the cusp of greatness, a story that fosters an exceptionally strong and positive community bond. The article suggests that this shared experience of striving and near-misses, like the team's four consecutive Super Bowl losses, creates a powerful sense of belonging that transcends geography.</p>
