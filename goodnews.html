          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, Switzerland, between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng. These discussions mark the first formal negotiations since the US imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports earlier in the year, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing. While full details are expected to be released soon, experts anticipate potential tariff cuts, although some remain skeptical about the extent of the concessions. The talks are viewed as crucial for de-escalating trade tensions and mitigating the risk of a global recession.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to sign an executive order to lower drug costs in the United States by tying Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest prices paid by other countries. The "most favored nation" policy aims to ensure that the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest price globally, and this initiative revisits a program previously blocked in court during Trump's first term. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly oppose the plan, arguing that it would hurt profits and innovation, while Trump claims it will save the government trillions of dollars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While solar energy is becoming increasingly popular, experts advise against DIY solar panel installation due to its complexities and potential risks. Bret Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, emphasizes that installing solar panels involves electrical, roofing, and regulatory challenges that require specialized expertise. DIY installations can lead to safety hazards, costly repairs, and voided warranties and incentives. Although DIY kits may seem cost-effective, hidden expenses like permitting and professional electrician fees can outweigh the savings, making professional installation a smarter and safer investment.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, known for providing affordable medical care to all residents, is facing strain from an aging population and shrinking workforce, leading to political maneuvering ahead of key elections.

Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust in government.</p>

Dr. Morgan also notes that excess protein consumption can lead to weight gain, as the excess is stored as fat.</p>
