          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min lauded recently dismissed manager Ange Postecoglou as a club "legend" who significantly altered the club's trajectory. Despite Postecoglou's sacking shortly after securing the club's first silverware in 17 years, Son expressed gratitude for the manager's belief in the team and his trust in him as captain. Other players, including Vicario, Van de Ven, and Solanke, also shared their appreciation for Postecoglou's leadership and the success achieved under his guidance. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged Postecoglou's impact while emphasizing the need for the board to fully support his successor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles is reportedly "livid" over a potential pheasant shortage at Sandringham Estate, which may lead to the cancellation of the royal family's cherished Boxing Day shoot. The shortage is attributed to a recent staff shake-up and the king's preference for maintaining the estate's game population rather than importing birds. Experts suggest this disruption may prompt the king to review the shooting tradition, which has faced criticism from animal rights groups. Some speculate that the change in plans could allow King Charles to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p>
