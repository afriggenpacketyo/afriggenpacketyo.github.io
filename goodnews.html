        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK can anticipate a stunning 'Blood Moon' total lunar eclipse this evening, a celestial event where the Moon turns red as it passes through Earth's shadow. The article provides specific timings for different UK regions and advises on optimal viewing locations, emphasizing that binoculars or telescopes can enhance the experience without eye damage. This natural phenomenon, last visible in the UK in 2022, offers a unique opportunity to observe the mechanics of the solar system at play. It reminds viewers that the reddish appearance is due to Rayleigh scattering, similar to red sunsets.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, a venture that required him to relearn his own hit songs and guitar skills. The 66-year-old, who transitioned to a career as a television writer and producer decades ago, will kick off his 50-city 'The Road to Us Tour' on September 13. Cassidy expressed that the old songs feel new to him, and he believes his voice has improved over his long hiatus from performing. He admits to never fully enjoying the public spotlight, preferring his role as a storyteller now.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, advocating against oligarchic control and for progressive policies. The event, part of Sanders' 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour, drew a large audience supportive of Mamdani's pledges to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the wealthiest one percent. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, also condemned the dismissal of CUNY professors for Palestinian solidarity, sparking chants from the crowd. Sanders criticized mainstream Democrats for their muted response to Mamdani's grassroots campaign, framing it as a crucial test for the Democratic party's future.</p>

          <p>USC's offense, spearheaded by quarterback Jayden Maiava, delivered a commanding 59-20 rout against Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team, accumulating an impressive 755 yards—the most for USC in two decades. Maiava threw four touchdowns and achieved a career-high 412 passing yards, while the Trojans' rushing attack also excelled with 309 yards. Despite some defensive lapses, USC's overwhelming offensive firepower secured a decisive win. Coach Lincoln Riley acknowledged that the team still has room for improvement, but the performance showcased their significant scoring potential early in the season.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles, a process known as cavitation. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse, creating a strong propulsive force. Scientists can precisely control the light flow to manipulate the robots' launch trajectories and even enable them to swim, showcasing a significant advancement in micro-robotics and propulsion systems.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are increasingly adopting Yondr locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms. This solution, now used by at least 2.5 million students in 35 states, aims to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment. While some students are skeptical or attempt to bypass the system, educators and the company's CEO believe it helps students experience life outside a 'fully digital realm.' The cost of these pouches, around $25-30 per student, has prompted discussions about budget allocation within school districts.</p>

Dr. Bennett highlights that women often avoid traditional veteran spaces where their service is misunderstood or dismissed. The group fosters a 'cathartic' community through various activities, helping members discuss shared experiences and challenges unique to their service.</p>
