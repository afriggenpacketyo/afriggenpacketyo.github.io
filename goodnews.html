        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but further progress is needed to meet net-zero targets by 2050. While greenhouse gas emissions have significantly decreased since 1990 due to the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, transport and buildings remain major emitters. The committee emphasizes the need for the government to lower electricity bills to incentivize households to switch to cleaner technologies, suggesting the removal of charges supporting older renewable energy projects from household bills. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband acknowledges the advice and reiterates the commitment to providing clean power for families and businesses, but the government must also find ways to offset the costs which would likely fall on general taxation. Optimism surrounds the potential for achieving net-zero through effective policy and rapid technological advancements.</p>

          <p>New York City Democrats are choosing their mayoral nominee in a primary viewed as a battle between the party's left-wing and moderate factions. The race pits democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani against former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amidst sexual harassment allegations. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, focuses on affordability with proposals like free public buses and universal childcare. Cuomo, backed by unions, emphasizes experience and public safety, criticizing Mamdani's ambitious promises. The outcome is expected to have national implications as Democrats grapple with internal divisions and strategies to counter Trump's appeal.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding $5 billion in funds previously allocated to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The lawsuit, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, argued that the administration's suspension of the Nevi program violated congressional intent. The judge granted a partial injunction, stating that the states were likely to succeed in their lawsuit. The Trump administration's decision to review the program and suspend approvals was seen as contradictory to the program's goal of deploying electric vehicle chargers, especially given Trump's past criticism of electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez have changed the venue for one of their wedding parties in Venice due to security concerns and potential protests. The party was moved from the Scuola Grande della Misericordia to the more isolated Arsenale, surrounded by water and accessible only by boat when connecting bridges are raised. Protests have increased due to concerns about celebrity guests overwhelming Venice with private jets and yachts, as well as disagreements with Bezos's politics. Despite the change, the wedding festivities are expected to proceed with a number of celebrity guests, while organizers have pushed back on the idea that the nuptials will overrun the city.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart is set to perform in the coveted "legends" slot at Glastonbury, but he is not entirely happy with the billing, preferring it not be called the "tea time slot." Despite this, he has persuaded organizers to extend his set to an hour and a half. Stewart recalls his previous Glastonbury performance in 2002, which he barely remembers, and contrasts it with a memorable New Year's Eve concert in Brazil where he played to three million people despite being violently ill beforehand. He discusses his career, including his early days with the Faces and his solo success, as well as his signature hairstyle and his discovery as a harmonica player.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff condemned the leaking of an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes, calling it "treasonous." The assessment reportedly concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program quickly. He emphasized that the proof is in the fact that "no one's shooting at each other."</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from the Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys. The study of thousands of stars revealed that as the Milky Way evolved, newly formed stars began spinning up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The research presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study how the galaxy has changed.</p>

The dinosaur, about the size of a Labrador, was originally classified as a Nanosaurus but has now been determined to be a distinct species based on unique features in its leg bones. The discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic period and the evolutionary history that led to the development of larger and more bizarre dinosaurs.

          <p>With ICE sweeps taking place across the country, several films have captured the complexities of the Latino immigrant experience. These films include "El Norte," which follows siblings fleeing the Guatemalan Civil War; "Under the Same Moon," about a boy's journey to reunite with his mother in Los Angeles; "Una Noche," about three Cuban youths attempting to flee to Miami; "I'm No Longer Here," which explores the Cholombiano subculture in Monterrey; and "I Carry You With Me," a love story that traverses borders and decades. These films offer a nuanced perspective on the challenges and motivations of immigrants.</p>
