          <p>Amid market volatility, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend stocks for investors looking for regular income. Companies highlighted include EOG Resources, which recently increased its dividend following a major acquisition, and energy infrastructure firm Williams Companies, noted for its long-term growth projects. Telecom giant Verizon Communications also made the list after raising its profit guidance, offering a dividend yield of 6.3%. The analysis suggests these firms possess solid fundamentals and a consistent ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While on a visit to Scotland, US President Donald Trump announced that he had spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, pressing them for an immediate ceasefire following recent deadly border clashes. Trump stated on social media that both nations agreed to meet to work towards peace, a development both countries acknowledged while maintaining their respective positions. The intervention is notable as it comes a week before significant US tariffs on both countries are set to take effect. Trump linked the prospect of future trade talks to the cessation of hostilities between the two Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Frankie Muniz, known for his Emmy-nominated role in "Malcolm in the Middle," is now a full-time driver in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, pursuing a passion that predates his acting career. Muniz insists that racing is not a hobby, but a serious profession he is dedicated to, having put his acting career on hold to compete at a high level. He joins other actors like Paul Newman and Patrick Dempsey who have ventured into motorsports, but faces skepticism that he is merely a celebrity living out a fantasy. Muniz and fellow driver Toni Breidinger, a model, are working to prove their legitimacy in the competitive world of NASCAR.</p>

          <p>In the jungles of northern Guatemala, environmental groups have set up large, regularly refilled tubs of water to help wildlife cope with extreme heat and drought. Motion-activated cameras placed nearby have captured incredible footage of a diverse range of animals, including elusive jaguars and tapirs, using these artificial watering holes. The project not only provides a vital lifeline for animals during periods of water scarcity but also offers researchers valuable insights into animal behavior. This initiative demonstrates a simple yet effective way humans can help wildlife adapt to the increasingly unpredictable conditions caused by climate change.</p>

          <p>This article explains the science behind sunscreens and the importance of using them to prevent skin cancer, as cases continue to rise globally. It details the two main types of ultraviolet (UV) light, UVA and UVB, and how sunscreens work to protect the skin, either through "organic" carbon-based molecules that absorb UV or "physical" filters like zinc oxide. While acknowledging consumer concerns about certain chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, experts emphasize that the protective benefits against DNA damage and cancer far outweigh the potential risks. The article also debunks myths about "natural" alternatives and warns against homemade sunscreens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has announced the discovery of a super-large zirconium deposit, a crucial material for advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons and nuclear reactors. The deposit, the first of its kind found in a terrestrial basin in China, is estimated to contain two million tonnes of zirconium dioxide. This finding increases the country's total reserves of the mineral by a factor of four. Zirconium alloys are highly valued for their extreme resistance to heat and corrosion, making them essential for manufacturing key components in aerospace and defense applications, such as scramjet combustion chambers and nose cones.</p>

          <p>This article examines why Poland was the only Eastern European nation at the Women's Euro 2025, in stark contrast to the region's strong representation in men's football. Experts point to a combination of cultural, political, and economic factors, including societal norms that discourage girls from playing football and a history of underinvestment in the women's game. The collapse of state-sponsorship after the fall of communism created financial struggles, and the more recent rise of right-wing politics has reinforced traditional gender roles. Despite these challenges, there is hope that increased UEFA investment and the growing visibility of women's tournaments will foster development.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why US stock markets have been hitting record highs despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs. Key factors include a resilient economy with a strong labor market and corporate earnings that have proven sturdier than expected. Furthermore, investors seem to believe Trump's bark is worse than his bite, a theory dubbed the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out), as he has often delayed or reduced initially announced tariffs. However, fears remain that the market is priced for perfection and vulnerable to a pullback, given the unresolved trade disputes and the eventual economic impact of higher import costs.

          <p>This article details how comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, along with the creators of South Park, have recently pushed back against perceived censorship and corporate pressure. The pushback followed the cancellation of Colbert's "The Late Show" by Paramount-owned CBS, a move that raised questions about its timing relative to the approval of a major Paramount merger. Stewart delivered a blistering monologue on "The Daily Show," while "South Park" launched its new season with a savage satire of President Trump and the Colbert cancellation. The events highlight how satirists can use their platforms to immediately and dramatically show their independence and refusal to be intimidated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing reforms to planning and licensing rules to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the closure of several establishments. Under the new proposals for England and Wales, developers building new homes near existing venues would be required to soundproof the properties. The changes also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and al fresco dining to help reverse the long-term decline in the pub industry. The Labour government hopes the changes will remove red tape and bring vibrancy to struggling towns.</p>
