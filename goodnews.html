          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki from Allen, Texas, emerged as the winner of the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, marking its 100th anniversary. Faizan, who was last year's runner-up, triumphed over eight other finalists after several rounds of intense competition. The final showdown saw Faizan correctly spell "√©claircissement," a noun meaning "clearing up of something obscure," without hesitation, leading to an emotional celebration on stage. The competition, held just outside Washington, D.C., featured 243 young spellers who had advanced through local and regional bees, with Faizan earning over $50,000 in cash and prizes.</p>

          <p>Kell Morris, a 61-year-old Alaska man, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours during a hike near Godwin Glacier. His wife, Jo Roop, a retired Alaska State Trooper, kept his head above water while waiting for rescue. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and used its helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. Firefighters used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a local hospital, where he was observed for two nights before being released unscathed; Morris attributes his survival to luck and his wife's quick thinking.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Labour leader Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of engaging in "fantasy economics" regarding their welfare policies. Badenoch criticized their consideration of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, arguing that it would burden taxpayers to fund unlimited child support. She stated that Britain cannot afford such policies and needs leaders who do not treat economics as entertainment. Her comments come as both Labour and Reform UK have indicated they are exploring options to modify or remove the existing benefit cap.</p>

The rail line, used by Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, was closed in April for emergency construction approved by the California Coastal Commission. Crews installed 5,900 tons of boulders to stabilize the rail and will place 240,000 cubic yards of sand between Mariposa and North beaches.

          <p>The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction last month after several sections of the rail, which lie below bluffs, were deemed unstable and at immediate risk of landslide and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of large boulders, known as riprap, along the rail, which are intended to absorb flowing water and stabilize potential runoff that may obstruct the rail. Up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand will also be placed between two crucial points along the rail between Mariposa and North beaches. The OCTA said crews are preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail, but noted that the construction schedule is still being determined.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed tariffs in a phone call, aiming to deepen their understanding of each other's positions. Ishiba emphasized the need to build "win-win" relations and reiterated his call for removing higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese products. While a three-month reprieve from a 24 percent "reciprocal" tariff was granted, a baseline rate of 10 percent remains in place for Japan. Ishiba also expressed his desire to hold a face-to-face meeting with Trump at the Group of Seven summit in Canada.</p>
