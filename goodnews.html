          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects underlying economic fundamentals during discussions on bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgment suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks, despite President Trump's previous concerns about Japan's trade surplus. The two officials reaffirmed their belief that exchange rates should be market-determined and avoided discussing desired foreign exchange levels, while Kato voiced concerns over the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Diane Bahlawan, a 34-year-old California woman, was arrested at San Francisco International Airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle 151 pounds of cannabis onto a United Airlines flight to Frankfurt, Germany. Airport security discovered 131 vacuum-sealed bags of cannabis in her four roller bags, along with her cellphone, boarding pass, and $960 in cash. Bahlawan was charged with burglary and unlawful transport of marijuana and subsequently released on bail with her arraignment scheduled for June 2. The San Mateo County District Attorney noted the unusual scale of the case, given the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office typically handles larger marijuana transportation cases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned most of the nearly 400 books removed from its library for addressing anti-racism and gender issues, following a Pentagon-ordered review. The review is part of the Trump administration's effort to purge so-called DEI content from federal agencies. While about 20 books remain pulled for further review, officials say this number also includes some books that were not removed during the initial purge. The services' libraries had to provide their new lists of books to Pentagon leaders, and additional guidance will be given on how to cull those lists, if needed, and determine what should be permanently removed.</p>
