          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from preventing foreign students from traveling to the United States to study at Harvard University. The ruling came hours after Harvard called the policy illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The university argued that the action was a "government vendetta" against Harvard, violating the school's First Amendment rights. The Trump administration sought to halt billions in federal funding to the school after Harvard rejected demands to change disciplinary practices and address antisemitism, though Harvard contends it is being punished for protected speech. The judge's decision allows international students to continue their studies while the legal battle proceeds.</p>

          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods. Plant-based brands are launching new ranges with natural ingredients in response to consumer avoidance of processed meat replacements. However, some nutritionists argue that leaving out fortified nutrients is a step backward for public health. Experts also expect a rise in marketing that pushes the virtues of less processed food products, justifying their higher price points.</p>
