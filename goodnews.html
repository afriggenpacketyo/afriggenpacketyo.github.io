          <p>Japan's current account surplus hit a record 30.38 trillion yen ($208 billion) in fiscal 2024, marking the second consecutive year of record highs, driven by substantial returns on foreign investments, according to government data. This represents a 16.1 percent increase from the previous year, reaching the highest level since comparable data became available in fiscal 1985. Other key headlines include China and the U.S. agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism amidst tariff disputes, and the WTO head planning to meet with Japanese officials to discuss global trade concerns. Meanwhile, South Korea's presidential election campaign has commenced, and Japan's corporate bankruptcies for April have reached an 11-year high.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the U.S. must urgently build its AI computing infrastructure to compete with China and maintain national security and economic leadership. It emphasizes the need for massive investments in specialized cloud platforms, advanced cooling systems, cutting-edge chip technology, and a skilled workforce. The author calls for transparent regulations, expedited energy development, and public-private partnerships to train more plumbers, electricians, and engineers. By treating AI infrastructure as a strategic asset, the U.S. can unlock a $20 trillion opportunity by 2030 and secure its future in economic growth and national security.</p>

          <p>Recent China-US trade talks in Geneva are viewed as carrying both economic and political significance, potentially leading to substantive deals addressing tariffs and trade barriers. The agreement to establish a "trade consultation mechanism" provides interim political relief for both powers without appearing weak on the trade war front. While the US seeks to demonstrate wins, China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience. China's strategic patience and resilience-building aim to insulate its domestic economy from external shocks while engaging selectively in global markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports that Donald Trump's administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns regarding bribery and corruption. There is a history of U.S. presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from clothes and antiques to animals, which are typically managed through a complex bureaucratic process. Under U.S. law, foreign gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and must be logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit, though presidents can retain gifts by paying fair market value. The article provides a historical context of presidential gift-giving and the rules governing it.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks in Geneva, conflicting statements from US and Chinese officials have left financial markets and businesses uncertain about whether a "deal" was reached. While the US Trade Representative indicated an agreement, China's vice premier acknowledged constructive discussions but stopped short of declaring a deal. The White House released a statement announcing a "China Trade Deal," but details remain unclear, with a joint statement expected on Monday. This ambiguity underscores the sensitivities surrounding trade relations between the world's two largest economies, which have been strained by tariffs imposed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands in the UK for the first time in approximately 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies, as elk are considered a keystone species that can enhance habitats for other wildlife. Challenges include gaining public acceptance and assessing disease risks to livestock. The project draws inspiration from the successful reintroduction of beavers, with plans to engage residents and landowners to inform and excite them about the return of these native animals.</p>

Mahathir suggests that American products cannot compete with cheaper alternatives, causing the U.S. economy to suffer. He predicts Trump will eventually reverse his decision, as tariffs on items like iPhones will make them more expensive for American consumers. Mahathir believes ASEAN can withstand the impact of the tariffs through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States.</p>
