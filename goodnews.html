        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reclassify psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms. The proposal suggests moving the substance from a highly restrictive Schedule I narcotic to a less restrictive Schedule II classification, which would acknowledge its potential medical value despite risks. This move follows years of growing research indicating psilocybin's benefits in treating mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. While some researchers urge caution, the potential reclassification could significantly expand access for therapeutic use, a topic championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast for several days. Storm surge warnings remain in effect for parts of North Carolina, where evacuation orders were issued for vulnerable areas like Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. The storm's large size, with hurricane-force winds extending 105 miles from its center, is creating hazardous marine conditions far from its direct path.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, debt forgiveness programs are an option for consumers facing severe financial hardship. Generally, individuals with at least $7,500 in unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills, may qualify for these programs. Candidates also typically need to demonstrate proof of significant financial distress, like job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. Furthermore, consumers who are already delinquent on their payments are often more likely to be considered, as creditors may prefer a partial settlement over the risk of total loss from bankruptcy.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:22:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend where nearly 44% of American adults are ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations for this behavior are to save money and consume smaller portion sizes amid rising food costs and economic uncertainty. This shift in consumer habits comes as some major fast-food chains have reported a slowdown in sales, particularly among lower-income customers. By opting for kids' meals, adults are finding a practical solution to manage their budgets while still enjoying the experience of dining out, signaling a notable adaptation to current economic pressures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:21:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a significant and growing demand for skilled trade workers such as electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians. This boom is exacerbating an existing labor shortage, with an estimated 400,000 unfilled trade jobs in the U.S., a number projected to grow substantially. As older workers retire, fewer young people are entering these fields, creating intense competition for talent between data centers and other industries like manufacturing. Industry experts highlight the need for aggressive recruitment and apprenticeships to fill these well-paying jobs that are crucial for supporting the nation's digital infrastructure.</p>
