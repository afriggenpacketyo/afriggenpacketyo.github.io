          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war, suspending steep tariffs in a move that sent stock market futures soaring. The U.S. will reduce its levies on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China will cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. This agreement follows negotiations in Switzerland and aims to provide a window for further discussions to resolve trade tensions, although some analysts remain cautious about the long-term implications and potential for a lasting resolution. The article also notes the positive reaction from global stock markets, including surges in Hong Kong, Germany, France, and Britain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling a potential breakthrough in ongoing trade negotiations. The two countries will suspend most levies imposed since early April for 90 days, moving forward in a spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that both Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to allow negotiations to progress, effectively reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China's levies on American imports to 10%. The article mentions the positive impact on commodities, currency markets, and stock futures, though some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment to easing tensions.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures jumped 4% following the agreement between the U.S. and China to slash tariffs, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. crude oil was up $2.52 to $63.54 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent rose $2.33 to $66.24 per barrel. The temporary reduction in tariffs, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports now at 30% and Beijing's tariffs on American goods at 10%, aims to foster further negotiations and alleviate concerns about a potential recession that would slow demand. The article notes that oil prices had previously plunged to a four-year low due to President Trump's global tariff regime.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its immigration plans, aiming for a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by raising qualification thresholds, doubling the residency period for indefinite stay applications, and scrapping care visas. Simultaneously, the party intends to expand eligibility for the "high potential individual" visa and ease access for top scientific and design talent. Overseas graduates will have a shorter post-study stay, and there will be increased English language requirements for visa applicants. While seeking to reduce net migration, Labour avoids setting an overall cap, opting for a flexible approach.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points and suspend additional duties for 90 days. The substantial tariff cuts, set to take effect by Wednesday, followed ministerial talks in Geneva to ease trade tensions. Washington and Beijing also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern. Under the agreement, the United States will retain an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, while China will retain at least a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods.</p>
