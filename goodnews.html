          <p>A federal appeals court is considering a novel approach to counter President Trump's actions that have effectively dismantled protections for federal civil servants. Trump fired members of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), leaving the agency without the quorum needed to operate. The Fourth Circuit's proposal suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role due to these firings, federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This decision aims to prevent the erosion of civil service protections.</p>

One consideration is whether to wait for a price drop, but the price of gold tends to rise over time, making waiting risky. Monitoring inflation reports and Federal Reserve meetings in June could provide insight into potential price changes. Investors should limit gold investments to a maximum of 10% of their overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he has "straightened out" issues related to rare earth minerals with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This statement suggests progress in resolving trade disputes between the two countries. Rare earth minerals are critical components in various industries, making their trade a significant aspect of the U.S.-China relationship. The outcome of these discussions could have implications for global supply chains and economic stability.</p>

          <p>Mike Flanagan's "The Life of Chuck," based on a Stephen King novella, presents a backward-structured narrative about an accountant whose death marks the end times for characters in his mind. The film explores the idea that even an ordinary person has a rich inner life, though the narrative structure doesn't fully succeed. The opening act, depicting a world collapsing, is compelling, but the film loses momentum as it progresses. The film is a philosophical puzzle that doesn't entirely add up, but contains moments of magic.</p>

          <p>The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that language is inadequate for conveying subtle truths and subjective experiences. Misunderstandings are common in human communication, and language is merely a crude model of the world. Wittgenstein's proposition suggests that we will never fully comprehend the meaning of our lives through words alone. To find meaning without words, we need to seek transcendence through contemplation and focused reflection, seeking understanding rather than precise answers.</p>
