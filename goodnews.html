          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Unexpectedly Due to Falling Exports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. Domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and offsetting some of the negative impact. Experts suggest that while the weak yen provided a competitive advantage, it was overshadowed by China's machinery and tool exports. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current interest rates until more economic certainty emerges amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must quickly adapt and reform to avoid becoming a "shock absorber" of global trade imbalances resulting from the US-China trade war. While recent talks have led to a reduction in tariffs, experts say Europe needs deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies to become a "third pole" in a bipolar world. Without these changes, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, net income fell short of analyst predictions due to macroeconomic volatility and the U.S.-China trade war. The company is facing an intense price war in China with rivals and is investing in its "instant commerce" model to differentiate itself. Alibaba executives have stated that the company will be investing "aggressively" in its instant commerce model.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Among the fossils studied were Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.
