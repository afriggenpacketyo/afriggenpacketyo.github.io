        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can be an affordable borrowing option, even for smaller amounts like $15,000, due to interest rates currently below 8%. This article breaks down the monthly payments, which range from approximately $142 to $181 depending on the repayment term, noting that these costs are lower than in previous months. A HELOC offers flexibility with its variable rates, which may decrease further, and the potential for tax-deductible interest. Unlike a home equity loan, HELOCs often require interest-only payments during the initial draw period, making initial costs more manageable for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, upholding the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued that the judgment was a "financial death penalty" that violated his free speech rights. The families of the victims, who have yet to receive any payment, expressed that the court's decision was a proper rejection of Jones's latest attempt to evade accountability. The ruling allows the legal process to move forward, potentially leading to the liquidation of Jones's Infowars media company to pay the damages.</p>

Earnings per share rose by 45.8% to $12.25, driven by a significant surge in investment banking revenue, particularly in advisory and underwriting services. Despite initial market profit-taking, the stock recovered as CEO David Solomon expressed optimism about the M&A landscape. The bank's strong performance was also reflected in improved efficiency ratios and a record $3.45 trillion in assets under supervision, reinforcing confidence in its financial health.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as "quantitative tightening," could end in the coming months. Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that the Fed is approaching its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks, a key indicator for stopping the balance sheet runoff. He did not provide guidance on future interest rate moves but emphasized that the labor market's downside risks have risen. Powell's comments signal a potential shift in monetary policy as the Fed navigates economic conditions affected by slowing payroll gains and a recent government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion in bitcoin linked to a massive "pig butchering" investment fraud operation based in Cambodia. This marks the largest forfeiture action in the department's history. An indictment was unsealed against Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme, who remains at large. Prosecutors claim his conglomerate, Prince Holding Group, operated forced-labor compounds where trafficked individuals executed cryptocurrency scams that defrauded victims worldwide of billions. The scams involved building trust with victims online before convincing them to transfer funds into accounts controlled by the criminals.</p>

          <p>With silver prices surging, this article examines which forms of silver are easiest to sell for cash quickly.

Even pre-1965 U.S. coins, known as "junk silver," are easy to sell for their melt value.

          <p>A recent study highlights a significant disconnect between the values of Gen Z and those of hiring managers, potentially rendering many young people "unemployable." While Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, employers seek candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. NYU professor Suzy Welch advises Gen Z workers to honestly assess their financial goals to determine their career path. For those needing immediate employment, she suggests temporarily embracing more traditional work values and committing to a period of delayed gratification, rather than trying to change their core principles, to achieve long-term success.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt forgiveness can be a viable option, though it comes with significant drawbacks like a damaged credit score. This article explains that while there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs, consumers can pursue debt settlement by negotiating with creditors to pay a reduced lump sum. Other alternatives include debt consolidation loans, using home equity, or enrolling in debt management or financial hardship programs offered by lenders. As a last resort, bankruptcy can provide a complete discharge of debt, offering a financial fresh start but with long-term credit implications.</p>
