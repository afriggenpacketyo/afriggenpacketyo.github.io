          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This translates to a ¬£129 reduction in the typical annual bill, reflecting a fall in international wholesale gas prices. However, charities emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs and owe suppliers billions. The announcement follows recent debates about winter fuel payments, with the government considering expanding eligibility for pensioners.</p>

Columbia stated it would continue to collaborate with the government to combat antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination. The accusation comes amidst a broader effort by the Trump administration to change the culture of American higher education by withholding federal funding from schools it deems to be bastions of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims of being the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett's conviction on charges of staging the incident was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. The city believes the settlement provides a fair resolution, allowing all parties to move forward.</p>
