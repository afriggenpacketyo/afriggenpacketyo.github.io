          <h2>Gulf Markets Show Limited Reaction to US Strike on Iran</h2>

          <p>Gulf markets ended mostly higher on Sunday, showing limited reaction to the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would help resolve the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul initially opened higher but closed down slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major gainer, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for appeasement and distancing from the conflict have shielded it from major market impacts, with some viewing the removal of the Iranian threat as a positive factor.

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran and struck three key Iranian nuclear sites, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on Sunday on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help it to come to an end, despite the Iranian Foreign Minister's insistence that the country could not return to diplomacy "while under attack." The broader TA-125 index was trading 1.77% higher on Sunday, while the TA-35, Tel Aviv's blue-chip index, was up 1.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
