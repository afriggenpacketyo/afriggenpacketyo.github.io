          <p>Shares for video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw a significant 15% jump following reports of a potential deal to take the company private for approximately $50 billion. The deal, which could be the largest leveraged buyout in history, reportedly involves investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake. EA is known for major franchises like Madden NFL and The Sims, and this move reflects a growing trend of substantial investment in the gaming industry. The potential acquisition highlights strong investor confidence in the long-term value of established video game companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many consumers are struggling with high-interest balances. For those with significant debt, such as $20,000, credit card debt forgiveness, or settlement, is presented as a viable option. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing the debt by 30% to 50%. While this can offer substantial savings and a faster path to becoming debt-free compared to making minimum payments, it can also negatively impact one's credit score and may have tax implications.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have had only a minor impact on the monthly payments for home equity loans. A $20,000 home equity loan currently has monthly payments ranging from approximately $194 for a 15-year term to $246 for a 10-year term, only slightly lower than before the rate adjustments. Despite the modest change, these loans remain an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards due to their lower, fixed interest rates. The article suggests they can still be a strategic choice for homeowners, offering stability and potential tax advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has ended its preemption of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and will return the show to its ABC-affiliated stations. The broadcaster, along with Nexstar, had stopped airing the late-night program following controversial remarks made by the host regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Despite being blacked out on Sinclair and Nexstar stations, which represent about a quarter of ABC's affiliates, Kimmel's return episode drew a significantly larger-than-average broadcast audience. Nexstar has not yet announced if it will also resume airing the show, stating it is still evaluating the situation.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has found hip-hop producer Metro Boomin, whose real name is Leland Tyler Wayne, not liable in a civil sexual assault case brought against him. The lawsuit, filed in 2024 by Vanessa LeMaistre, alleged an assault occurred in 2016. The producer's legal team had consistently denied the allegations, calling them a "pure shakedown." After the verdict, Wayne expressed relief and gratitude, stating he could finally move past the "nonsense," while also noting the significant personal and professional toll the litigation has taken on him and his family over the past year.</p>

          <p>A shopper in upstate New York discovered an extremely rare, live orange lobster in a supermarket tank and purchased it to ensure its survival. The vibrant crustacean, nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, is estimated to be a one-in-30-million genetic anomaly. After temporarily housing it in a home aquarium, the shopper coordinated with the wildlife rescue group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium. The lobster was successfully released back into the open waters of the Long Island Sound, just a day before National Lobster Day, a time when many others of its species face a different fate.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has restored the party whip to former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum, readmitting them a year after they were suspended. They were among seven left-wing MPs who rebelled against the party line by voting to scrap the government's two-child benefit cap immediately after Labour's 2024 election victory. Upon her return, Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience. The move comes as Labour's leadership faces increasing internal pressure to abolish the controversial welfare policy, a topic expected to be central at the upcoming party conference.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured their 12th division title in 13 years, but the team acknowledges it was a difficult season marked by injuries, slumps, and bullpen struggles. Some players and staff recognize the challenges of trying to repeat as World Series champions, a phenomenon often called a "World Series hangover," which includes physical and mental fatigue. Despite the adversity, the team believes these regular-season trials have made them more battle-tested and resilient for the upcoming playoffs. They hope that overcoming these obstacles will better prepare them for their ultimate goal of achieving a consecutive World Series victory.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the article suggests that opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October can still be a strategic move for savers. By acting quickly, savers can lock in a fixed interest rate of around 4.50% before another potential rate cut at the end of the month, allowing interest to begin compounding immediately. With the likelihood of a rate reduction high, banks may preemptively lower their offered CD rates. Therefore, proactive savers are encouraged to secure a favorable rate now to maximize their returns in a declining interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows a recommendation from a committee which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population during the Dutch colonial era.
