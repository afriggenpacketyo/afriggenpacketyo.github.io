          <h2>Novo Nordisk to Offer Diabetes Medication Ozempic at Substantial Discount for U.S. Cash-Paying Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 11:19:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its widely used diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to cash-paying patients in the United States. This new price is less than half of the medication's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350, a figure that has drawn significant political and public criticism. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and comes amid mounting pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs. This pricing strategy follows a similar discount offered for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, and is intended to make the branded medication more accessible than potentially unsafe compounded alternatives.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar. The comprehensive two-stage plan is based on a framework developed by a U.S. envoy. It reportedly involves Hamas freeing approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages over a 60-day temporary truce. During this period, further negotiations would focus on establishing a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. There has been no immediate official comment from Israeli authorities on the development.</p>

          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and datacenter operator TeraWulf surged over 10% after Google increased its stake in the company to 14%. The investment is part of a deal where Google will provide up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backstop, bringing its total commitment to around $3.2 billion. This funding supports the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York, which is being developed for advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. The announcement follows recent 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which have already caused the company's stock to rise significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

Since its public listing in 2021, the company's share value has declined amid struggles to achieve profitability and concerns over losing its exclusive image through rapid expansion. The deal, which will return the company to private ownership, sees Kutcher joining the board of directors. The new owners aim to put the celebrity-favored hospitality group on a more stable financial footing while continuing its global growth.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear energy startup Kairos Power have announced a partnership to deploy an advanced nuclear plant that will connect to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. Under the agreement, TVA will purchase up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power from the Hermes 2 reactor, which will help supply electricity to Google's regional data centers. This collaboration marks a significant step for advanced nuclear technology, as it is the first U.S. utility power purchase agreement for such a reactor. The project aims to commercialize smaller, potentially more affordable nuclear plants to meet rising energy demands from technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the growing influence of internet culture on language, the Cambridge Dictionary has added thousands of new words this year, including slang terms popularized on social media. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a versatile nonsense word from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a shortened form of delusional. Other additions include "tradwife," referring to a woman embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," a term for a powerful group of male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that they only add words that demonstrate staying power and have become integrated into modern English.</p>

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit was filed over false claims aired by the network that the 2020 presidential election was rigged and that Dominion's equipment was used to manipulate votes. This settlement resolves one of the last major legal challenges against news organizations for their coverage of the 2020 election. It follows a similar, larger settlement Dominion reached with Fox News for $787 million, underscoring the significant financial consequences for media companies that broadcasted election-related conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>A civil forfeiture case against rapper Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffrey Williams, has been dismissed in Fulton County, allowing for the return of his seized belongings. The items, including nearly $150,000 in cash and several cars, were confiscated during the investigation into the sweeping Young Slime Life (YSL) RICO indictment. This development follows the rapper's acceptance of a plea deal in October 2024, which concluded his direct involvement in the high-profile trial. He had previously had his jewelry returned to him following his release from jail.</p>

          <h2>Study in Rural Kenya Finds Direct Cash Transfers Significantly Reduce Infant Mortality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 10:08:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study conducted in rural Kenya has revealed that direct, unconditional cash transfers of $1,000 to low-income households can dramatically save infants' lives. The research, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that infant mortality was nearly halved for those born to families who received the payment. This reduction is comparable to the effects of established medical interventions like vaccines and anti-malarial drugs. The study suggests the cash enables families to afford crucial healthcare services, particularly around childbirth, and better nutrition, highlighting a powerful, non-medical tool for improving child survival.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval for Novo Nordisk's popular obesity drug, Wegovy, to be used as a treatment for a serious liver disease known as MASH. This approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class medication authorized for the condition, which affects a significant number of U.S. adults and can lead to severe liver damage. The decision was based on trial data showing that Wegovy significantly improved liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. The news caused Novo Nordisk's shares to climb, further solidifying the drug's market position beyond weight loss and diabetes.</p>
