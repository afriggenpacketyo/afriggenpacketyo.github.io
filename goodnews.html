        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's government announced that China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which had been banned since August 2023 following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice to ease the ban and will soon open registration for Japanese facilities that process marine products. This move comes after Japan addressed concerns about the safety of its seafood following the controversial wastewater release. Other notable events include Japan and the U.S. holding tariff negotiations, Japan's parliament debating a dual surname bill, and North Korea allegedly providing Russia with ballistic missiles in violation of U.N. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over a proposed ban on foreign students could potentially reach the Supreme Court, reigniting discussions about when justices should recuse themselves from cases. Four Supreme Court justices have ties to Harvard, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. While alumni status alone does not typically warrant recusal, deeper involvement with the university, such as Jackson's past service on the Harvard Board of Overseers, could influence the decision. The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration's visa restrictions are unconstitutional, adding further complexity to the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>An experimental nasal spray containing a monoclonal antibody is being tested as a potential treatment to slow down Alzheimer's disease by reducing inflammation in the brain. Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive this treatment, has shown a reduction in brain inflammation, according to researchers. The drug, foralumab, is also being tested for other inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and has demonstrated promising results. While it remains uncertain whether the treatment will improve Walsh's cognitive functions, his wife has observed positive signs of increased social engagement, suggesting a potential benefit from the anti-inflammatory effects of the nasal spray.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology. Riess's precise observations of galaxies have revealed a discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble tension, which challenges the current understanding of dark energy. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess believes that the Hubble tension could indicate a flaw in the standard model. New data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggests that dark energy may be weakening, potentially requiring a revision of the standard model and altering our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggested that the shifting geopolitical landscape presents an opportunity to elevate the euro's status as a global currency. Lagarde highlighted that multilateral cooperation is being replaced by zero-sum thinking, creating uncertainty around the US dollar's dominant role. She outlined three key areas for Europe to focus on: establishing a solid geopolitical foundation, reinforcing its economic base to attract global capital, and bolstering its legal framework. A stronger euro could lead to lower borrowing costs, protection from exchange rate volatility, and increased control over Europe's destiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts, driven by strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports. This marked the strongest quarterly growth in fiscal year 2025, with the full year expansion estimated at 6.5%. Despite global economic uncertainties and trade policies, India's growth outlook remains robust, supported by improving consumer demand in rural areas. The International Monetary Fund projects India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's in 2025, becoming the world's fourth-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Although Trump has expressed frustration with both Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin, material support, intelligence sharing, and existing sanctions on Russia have largely remained in place. Even if the US reduces its involvement, European governments and Ukraine's own defense industry could fill the gap, and allies have agreed to lift range restrictions on weapons headed to Ukraine. This article suggests that Ukraine's position is more stable than it appears, despite the unpredictable nature of US foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist challenges the traditional concept of animal instincts, arguing that the term is confusing and lacks a useful scientific definition. Mark Blumberg emphasizes that behaviors are influenced by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, learning, and the animal's physical body. He uses examples like tailorbirds building nests and border collies herding to illustrate how behaviors develop through a combination of predispositions and experiences. Blumberg advocates for studying behaviors within a broader system, considering both the animal's internal processes and its interactions with the environment.</p>
