          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to be unofficially underway as several prominent Democrats are increasing their media visibility to a wide range of audiences. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on diverse podcasts and media outlets, including those with conservative hosts. This strategy signals a shift toward reaching a broader electorate and a potential course correction for the party following its 2024 election loss. These early appearances are also seen as an attempt to appeal to party elites and donors in a developing primary field.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Big Tech Is Underspending, Not Overspending, on Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not investing too much in artificial intelligence, but are actually underspending in the burgeoning field. He framed the AI race as a "winner-take-all" situation, suggesting that companies reducing investment do not believe they can ultimately succeed. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure on AI, Cramer argued these investments are both necessary and justified to achieve market dominance. He believes the company with the most accurate AI will establish a near-monopoly. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" concludes with a mid-credits scene that formally introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The scene depicts a mysterious cloaked figure approaching Sue and Reed Richards' powerful young son, Franklin, hinting at the antagonist's future role. This reveal is significant as it sets up the next major crossover film, "Avengers: Doomsday," where actor Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character. The tease also suggests a potential multiversal conflict for the team's future adventures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has signed a memorandum of understanding with Mexico, committing to a permanent solution for the chronic sewage pollution in the Tijuana River. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the Trump administration is motivated to resolve the decades-old crisis, which affects communities and naval training areas in Southern California. The agreement aims to expedite infrastructure projects and reallocate previously committed funds from Mexico to improve wastewater treatment. While environmental groups see this as a major step, some local officials remain skeptical about the plan.</p>

          <p>The nightly entertainment news program "E! News" is being canceled, with its final episode scheduled for September 25.

The cancellation will result in the elimination of about 20 jobs, though the E! news brand will continue its robust online and social media presence. The network will also continue its popular live coverage of red carpet events for major awards shows.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is positioned for a significant contract extension after his next season, following a trend of young NFL stars securing lucrative deals. After a record-setting rookie year and a strong second season, Nacua is currently playing on a highly team-friendly contract from his fifth-round draft selection. As he enters his third year, he is focused on improving his game alongside new teammate Davante Adams. If his high level of production continues, he could command a massive payday in 2026, similar to other top receivers.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is introducing a new lineup of ten beverages for testing in 500 U.S. restaurants, inspired by its recently closed CosMc's drink-focused spinoff. The new drinks, including cold brews, refreshers, and crafted sodas, are designed to appeal to Gen Z customers and capture the growing market for afternoon snacks and specialty beverages. This move represents a strategic shift, integrating the lessons learned from the standalone CosMc's concept directly into the main McDonald's stores. The test will begin in September in markets including Wisconsin and Colorado to gauge customer response.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" about Republican prospects in the 2026 midterm elections, predicting his party will expand its House majority. He dismissed historical trends where the president's party typically loses seats, pointing to the 13 Democrats in districts Trump won in 2024 as key opportunities. Johnson also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing voters will feel its economic benefits despite current negative polling. He believes the law's tax cuts will act as "jet fuel" for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, preserves the ability of individuals and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The court intervened in a North Dakota case, blocking a lower appellate court ruling that would have stripped private citizens of the right to sue over alleged voting discrimination. This action maintains the status quo across most of the country while the justices prepare to rehear a similar, more complex case from Louisiana next term. The ultimate fate of this key enforcement mechanism remains uncertain.</p>
