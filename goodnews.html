          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after his death, confirming that he will be reincarnated and have a successor. Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, the Tibetan spiritual leader stated that the process of finding and recognizing his successor should follow past Buddhist traditions. He emphasized that this process lies solely with a trust he established, signaling that China should not interfere. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans and is expected to be met with opposition from Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next religious leader.</p>

          <p>As home insurance premiums rise due to an increase in extreme weather events, this article offers practical tips for homeowners to weather-proof their properties and potentially reduce costs. Key recommendations include performing regular roof maintenance or replacement, which can earn substantial insurance discounts, and installing storm shutters to protect windows and doors. Other suggestions involve sealing gaps around windows, clearing outdoor debris to reduce fire risk, and regularly cleaning gutters to prevent water damage. These proactive steps can lower the likelihood of filing a claim, which in turn can help manage rising insurance expenses.</p>

          <p>In a brief, reflective piece, an NPR correspondent shares a personal snapshot from the red cypress forests of Alishan in Taiwan, describing it as their favorite place on the island. The author found a sense of timelessness and inner calm within the ancient, mossy groves, which provided a peaceful contrast to the stress of daily reporting. The article is accompanied by a photograph capturing the sun's rays filtering through the trees, a moment a fellow hiker described as "god's smile." The postcard serves as a small tribute to the natural beauty and tranquility of the renowned mountainous region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled that a 176-year-old law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion, allowing the procedure to remain legal in the state. In a 4-3 decision along liberal-conservative lines, the court concluded that comprehensive legislation regulating abortion over the past 50 years effectively superseded the 19th-century statute. The ruling resolves a legal gray area that emerged after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, when abortion providers in Wisconsin had initially stopped services. Abortions can now continue up to 20 weeks of gestation under a law passed in the 1980s.</p>

Catherine emphasized that finishing treatment is not an immediate return to normal and that it is a life-changing experience for both the patient and their families.

          <p>A report from market research firm Yole Group projects that mainland China is on pace to overtake Taiwan in semiconductor foundry capacity by 2030. China's global share is forecast to grow from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan currently leads with a 23% share. This trend underscores the progress of Beijing's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency, particularly in the critical chipmaking sector, despite ongoing U.S. technology restrictions. The report also highlights that domestic Chinese fabs are expected to play an increasingly significant role in this expansion over the next several years. (not investment advice)</p>
