          <h2>United States and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement with 15% Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:31:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports, a reduction from a potential 25% levy. The agreement reportedly includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and aims to open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. This deal arrives at a politically crucial time for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose coalition recently lost its majority, potentially strengthening his position. Japanese automotive stocks surged following the announcement, reflecting positive market sentiment about the managed tariff levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Porsche, saw their stock prices rise following the announcement of a U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has generated optimism that the European Union might secure a similar arrangement. The EU has been trying to negotiate lower auto tariffs with the U.S. amid threats of a potential 30% levy on its imports. Analysts suggest the terms of the U.S.-Japan deal, which did not cap export volumes, could set a precedent for future negotiations with other major auto exporters like the EU and South Korea.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has made a historic return to the sport, becoming the oldest woman to win a WTA Tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. At 45 years old and after a 16-month hiatus, Williams defeated Peyton Stearns, a player 22 years her junior, at the Washington Open. This victory marks her first singles win since August 2023. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, emphasized that she returned to the sport for herself and has nothing to prove to anyone, showcasing her enduring passion and competitive spirit.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's new £60m midfielder, Martin Zubimendi, is set to make his first public appearance for the club after a year-long recruitment process. Manager Mikel Arteta revealed the signing was part of a well-orchestrated, multi-year plan to acquire both him and Mikel Merino from Real Sociedad. Zubimendi, a highly-rated defensive midfielder who was pivotal in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, explained that he initially turned down a move to feel he had more to learn at his former club. He stated that Arteta's meticulous coaching style was a key factor in his decision to ultimately join the Premier League team.</p>

          <p>Amidst a period of frequent and high-profile demonstrations in the U.S., from the Women's March to racial justice uprisings, questions are being raised about the actual effectiveness of protesting. This article explores the topic by consulting with experts, including Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, author of "A Protest History of the United States." The discussion delves into historical instances of resistance to understand which forms of protest have successfully led to lasting social change. It also examines the contemporary protest landscape to consider what constitutes a successful outcome or a "win" in today's political and social environment.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, coming in just below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%. These soft figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to bolster economic growth amid an uncertain global trade environment. The MAS has expressed concern about a subdued domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, anticipating that global consumption and investment will soften. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a difficult UK retail climate, a chain of stores called Duck World, which sells only rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat in prime London locations. The business, which offers over 700 varieties of collectible ducks, appeals to tourists, gift-seekers, and millennials, capitalizing on the "treatonomics" trend of small, mood-boosting purchases. The co-founder acknowledges challenges from inflation and rising business costs, which have forced price increases. While some analysts question the long-term viability of such a niche fad, the store's high-margin products and the enduring appeal of collectibles have so far contributed to its persistence in a tough market.</p>

          <p>Scientists have analyzed a 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone from a "terror bird" and found teeth marks matching a massive crocodilian predator, Purussaurus neivensis. Terror birds were formidable apex predators themselves, standing taller than a human, but the evidence suggests this one was attacked by an even larger reptile. The fossil was discovered in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, a rich fossil bed that was a humid swamp during the Middle Miocene epoch. Researchers believe the bird was ambushed at the water's edge in a "battle to the death," providing rare insight into the predator-prey dynamics of this ancient ecosystem.</p>
