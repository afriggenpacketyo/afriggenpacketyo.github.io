        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a significant increase after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, with revenues falling 2% on a currency adjusted basis to 999 million euros. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, forecasting sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros. Weaker sales were primarily due to reduced demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, attributed to an uncertain consumer outlook. The company continues to closely monitor economic developments and remains vigilant regarding elevated uncertainties, including ongoing tariff discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Labour Day holiday saw a rebound in tourism, with visitor levels surpassing pre-pandemic figures, although spending per head remained below 2019 levels. The increase in tourism and recovering retail sales are sending mixed signals about China's economic activity amid a trade war with the United States. Goldman Sachs noted that per capita tourism revenue was still 10% below pre-pandemic levels, indicating persistent deflationary pressure and continued consumption downgrading. The article suggests that China's reliance on the domestic market continues as the global economic landscape remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID deadline has arrived after two decades of delays and resistance, with the 2005 law aiming to create more secure state-issued IDs. States initially resisted due to cost, privacy concerns, and documentation burdens, leading to a variety of REAL ID "flavors." Millions have yet to apply for REAL ID versions, and the Trump Administration is now pressuring states that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status. The system continues to face pushback, with some officials requesting further delays, and the Transportation Safety Administration is auditing state compliance.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and new tariffs on China, experts predict that Temu and Shein will remain dominant forces in the U.S. e-tail scene. The companies are expected to adapt by onboarding more U.S. sellers, shifting to local warehouses, and leveraging their agile supply chains. While prices may increase, Temu and Shein's ability to offer competitive prices and adapt to consumer trends will allow them to maintain a strong presence in the American market.

The combined company will operate in over 40 countries, serving approximately 50 million customers per month. While the deal strengthens DoorDash's position and intensifies competition in the UK market, it also raises concerns about the trend of UK-listed companies being acquired by US firms. The offer of 180p per Deliveroo share represents a 44% increase from when takeover talks were made public, but remains below the initial 390p share price at its London Stock Exchange launch in 2021.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on "supply-side reform," China's economic narrative is shifting towards boosting domestic demand. The Communist Party's Politburo signaled a potential turning point by emphasizing the need to stabilize employment, enterprises, markets, and expectations while increasing household income and consumption. While supply-side reforms have transformed China into a powerhouse in emerging sectors, the country now faces the challenge of translating that success into stronger domestic demand. The article suggests that a new policy pivot is needed to prioritize the other half of the economic equation.</p>
