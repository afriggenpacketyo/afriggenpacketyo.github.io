          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, seeking to mend strained ties with President Xi Jinping. Both countries are grappling with the impact of US tariffs, which are pushing them to explore a potential economic reset despite long-standing border disputes and mutual mistrust. Experts view Modi's visit as a significant moment, as India aims to diversify its international alliances, while China seeks to project global South solidarity amid trade tensions. The leaders are focused on leveraging their respective economic strengths, with China's manufacturing and India's service sector, to reduce reliance on the United States and reconfigure global trade dynamics. This strategic alignment underscores a shift towards a multipolar world order.</p>

          <h2>Biologists Use Drones with AC/DC and Movie Clips to Deter Wolves from Livestock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists operating near the California-Oregon border are implementing a highly unconventional yet innovative strategy to safeguard livestock from gray wolves: utilizing drones outfitted with loudspeakers to project loud noises, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies featuring Scarlett Johansson, and live human voices. This ongoing experiment seeks to provide a non-lethal deterrence against the burgeoning wolf population, which has resulted in escalating conflicts with ranchers. While the technology presents challenges, such as its $20,000 cost and limited effectiveness in dense woodlands, initial studies indicate success in disrupting wolf hunts and promoting a more harmonious coexistence. Ranchers express appreciation for the immediate results but remain cautious about the long-term efficacy, fearing wolves might eventually become accustomed to the deterrents.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers clinched a hard-fought 17-10 road victory against No. 4 Clemson in a game dominated by strong defensive play. Offense was scarce early on, with both teams struggling to convert drives into points, marked by numerous punts and turnovers. LSU eventually broke the deadlock in the fourth quarter when quarterback Garrett Nussmeier connected with Trey-Dez Green for the go-ahead touchdown. Clemson's attempts to mount a comeback were consistently stifled by LSU's resilient defense, which preserved their lead in critical late-game situations. Nussmeier delivered a commendable performance, completing 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's offense, led by Cade Klubnik, struggled to establish a consistent running game.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's primary opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is at a pivotal moment, having recently seen its favorability rating climb above that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the first time in an extended period. Despite this promising surge in public approval, the KMT is currently consumed by internal uncertainty and anxiety regarding the succession of its chairman, Eric Chu Li-luan, who is slated to step down in October. This looming leadership transition presents both an opportunity and a challenge for the party to effectively leverage the DPP's declining popularity. The choice of the next leader will be instrumental in shaping the KMT's strategic direction and its capacity to consolidate this renewed political momentum.</p>

          <p>Germany is currently witnessing a significant transformation in its drinking culture, marked by a substantial decline in traditional beer sales, which have plummeted to their lowest levels in over three decades during the first half of 2025. In stark contrast, the popularity of non-alcoholic beer has soared, with sales more than doubling since 2013, reflecting a growing preference among younger, more health-aware consumers. Major breweries, such as Erdinger, are actively adapting to this trend by vigorously promoting their alcohol-free products at sporting events, positioning them as healthier alternatives to energy drinks. Despite the enduring cultural significance of full-strength beer, particularly in regions like Bavaria, the data indicates a clear and sustained shift towards more mindful consumption and a robust market for non-alcoholic options.</p>

This demanding environment, devoid of typical comforts like makeup and beauty products, is specifically designed to ascertain whether genuine romantic connections can flourish under significant adversity.

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying a sophisticated and unusual array of tools, including highly trained sniffer dogs, surveillance drones, and AI-powered bug traps, in their ongoing battle against the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus). This minute yet highly destructive insect poses a significant threat to British forests, having already decimated millions of spruce trees across Europe. Initially believed to arrive through imported wood, research now indicates the beetles are primarily carried by winds across the English Channel. This multi-faceted approach has remarkably led to the eradication of the beetle from designated at-risk zones in southeast England, a global first. Nevertheless, the escalating challenge of climate change, which stresses trees and fuels larger beetle populations in Europe, presents a continuous and intensifying risk of future infestations.</p>
