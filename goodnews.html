          <p>Chinese government scientists reported a successful weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where a fleet of cloud-seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across a vast area. The project utilized a small amount of silver iodide to generate a substantial volume of additional precipitation, enough to fill 30 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The test, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, demonstrates China's ongoing efforts to enhance water resources in its arid western regions through advanced weather modification technologies.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The annulled election saw a pro-Russian candidate surprisingly win the first round, leading to an investigation and a ban on his participation in the re-run. The election features pro-Western candidates and a hard-right candidate expected to progress to a second-round run-off, with concerns over populist conspiracy theories and Romania's support for Ukraine influencing voters.</p>

          <p>The article describes the Canton Fair, China's largest trade exhibition, as a bustling event with a diverse array of international buyers, signaling a shift away from dependence on the US market. Despite increasing tariffs from the US, the fair saw near-capacity crowds and premium service for potential overseas buyers. The absence of a strong presence of American buyers indicates China's growing focus on other global markets amid rising trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Critique of Baby Food Pouches Highlights Maternal Guilt Industrial Complex</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques the increasing panic surrounding ultra-processed baby foods, specifically pouches, and argues that it contributes to the maternal guilt industrial complex. The author, a mother herself, acknowledges dietary concerns but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who occasionally use pouches for convenience. She suggests that the debate often overlooks the social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices, particularly the time and labor involved in preparing fresh baby food. The author advocates for a more supportive society for parents, rather than solely focusing on individual choices.</p>
