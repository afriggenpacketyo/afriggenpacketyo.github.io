          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK to address a funding shortfall. This private capital investment is significant for a project of national interest in the UK, and Apollo will offer an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package with an interest rate below 7%. The project, which involves constructing two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, especially after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted its funding amid tensions with the British government. When completed, Hinkley Point C is expected to supply electricity to approximately six million homes, underscoring its importance to the UK's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued an apology to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 concerning the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered the metropolitan government and state to compensate Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada. Both men were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology's timing.</p>

          <p>Hannah Hampton's journey to becoming an England goalkeeper has been marked by overcoming a serious eye condition and navigating challenges early in her career. Despite being a "little immature" early on, Hampton's talent was recognized, and she rose through England's ranks, making her senior debut in 2022. After being dropped from the squad due to behavioral concerns, Hampton worked to rebuild relationships and prove herself, ultimately earning a recall and a place in the Euro squad.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, explores the challenges faced by caregivers in America, highlighting the lack of resources and support for those caring for sick or elderly relatives. The film traces the history of caregiving in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the current system where caregivers often feel alone and unsupported. Medicare's decision not to cover long-term care and the limitations of Medicaid have contributed to the problem, leaving families to cobble together help and spend significant amounts of money out of pocket. While there are signs that caregiving is returning to the public conversation, significant policy changes are still needed to address the issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent claims of a significant rightward shift among Gen Z voters are being challenged by an analysis of Cooperative Election Study data, which suggests that the youth-vote shift in 2024 was more of a one-off event than an ideological realignment. While young adults did vote for Trump at a higher rate in 2024, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold conservative political opinions. The data indicates that young adults are generally more liberal than previous generations on issues like immigration, race, and abortion, and their increased support for Republican candidates may be driven by dissatisfaction with the economy and a generalized pessimism.</p>
