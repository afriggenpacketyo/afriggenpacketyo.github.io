          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply Network Rail with train tracks, securing thousands of jobs and the short-term future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The agreement, commencing July 1st, ensures British Steel will continue providing 80% of Network Rail's track needs. The government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by Jingye, British Steel's Chinese owner, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic steel production. This deal demonstrates the government's commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains, particularly after the closure of Port Talbot's blast furnaces in 2024. The contract guarantees work for the Scunthorpe plant, the last in the UK producing virgin steel, for at least five years.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai are set to sign a deal at the Lujiazui Forum to enhance collaboration in the financial sector, aiming to strengthen their resilience against geopolitical tensions. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po will attend the signing of an action plan for collaborative development between the two cities. The agreement will outline a plan for cooperation across multiple layers and fields, with speculation suggesting an expansion of "connect" schemes for cross-border trading and trials of financial derivative products involving foreign currencies and commodities. This collaboration is viewed as a strategic move to better cope with the risk of financial decoupling from the U.S., where Chinese companies face potential delisting.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The "Queer Passion" focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ+ individuals, while the "Arabian Passion" promotes peace between the West and the Middle East. This year's festival theme is "transformation," reflecting changes in the economy, digital world, and climate, and how they relate to Bach's works. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, which received a valuable collection of letters and writings from Bach's sons.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets fired at Israel. However, building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles that could be used in an attack. Experts suggest that the scale of the project would be vastly different, comparing it to the difference between a kayak and a battleship.</p>
