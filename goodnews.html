          <p>Amanda Anisimova achieved a significant comeback victory against Naomi Osaka at the US Open, prevailing 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, to earn a spot in her second consecutive Grand Slam final. This impressive win follows her earlier semi-final success against Iga Swiatek, highlighting a remarkable return to form after she took a mental health break in 2023. Anisimova's journey to the final showcases her growing mental toughness and superior ball-striking, especially after overcoming an erratic start. She is now set to challenge the defending champion, Aryna Sabalenka, who also demonstrated resilience by winning her semi-final match against Jessica Pegula. This sets the stage for an exciting championship clash, with Anisimova aiming for her first major title.</p>

This development saw Alphabet's market capitalization increase by $230 billion, as a US District Judge decided against the most severe measures, such as a company breakup, that the Department of Justice had proposed. Pichai also commended the administration's "Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan," highlighting its focus on innovation and leadership in artificial intelligence. This acknowledgment comes as Google remains engaged in separate legal discussions with Trump's lawyers concerning his lawsuit against YouTube over alleged censorship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei is vigorously pursuing the development of the nation's copper potential, seeking to leverage soaring global demand fueled by the shift towards electrification and renewable energy. Under his ambitious "Make Argentina Great Again" agenda, Milei's government has implemented the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), designed to attract substantial foreign investment with attractive tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits over a 30-year period. Prominent mining giants such as BHP and Glencore are making significant commitments, with copper projects alone projected to account for $16 billion of the $30 billion in RIGI applications. This strategic focus aims to establish Argentina as a major contributor to the global copper supply, although its long history of economic volatility means that policy consistency and social acceptance will be vital for realizing this potential.

          <p>The defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles began their NFL season with a hard-fought 24-20 victory against the Dallas Cowboys, in a game characterized by early drama and an unusual weather delay. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into the contest for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, setting a contentious tone. An hour-long lightning delay further interrupted the third quarter, pausing the action. Despite these challenges and numerous penalties, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts delivered two rushing touchdowns, while Saquon Barkley also scored. The team's defense made a crucial late stop, allowing the Eagles to withstand the Cowboys' comeback attempts and secure a winning start to their title defense.</p>

          <h2>Outgoing UK Military Chief Assesses National Security as Stable for Near Future</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the recently retired head of the British armed forces, has publicly stated that the UK's national security is stable "for now and for the next few years." His confidence is rooted in several key factors: the United Kingdom's nuclear power status, its integral role within NATO—which he characterized as "the biggest and strongest gun club ever"—and its strong alliance with the United States. Sir Tony specifically lauded the swift and resolute response of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, noting a significant shift from the less decisive reaction to the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Additionally, he cautioned against overstating the significance of a new non-NATO "axis" forming after a recent military parade in China, suggesting that such alliances lack the historical trust and mutual support required for genuine warfighting capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Upcoming Chip Tariffs, Exempting Companies Investing in US Production</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his plan to implement "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports, specifically targeting companies that do not commit to shifting their production facilities to the United States. During a White House dinner with prominent tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump suggested that companies demonstrating significant domestic investment, such as Apple, would likely be spared from these impending levies. This move aligns with the administration's broader strategy to onshore the semiconductor supply chain, a goal that has already seen major global manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung Electronics pledge hundreds of billions of dollars towards constructing plants within the US. Although specific details regarding the tariffs and exemptions remain somewhat ambiguous, the policy clearly aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, thereby strengthening the nation's technological infrastructure and supply chain security.

          <p>Bidders vying for a stake in Starbucks’ China operations have reportedly submitted offers that value the business at up to US$5 billion, as per sources close to the negotiations. Should it materialize, this transaction would stand as one of the most substantial divestments of a China unit by a global consumer company in recent memory. The majority of these non-binding bids reportedly valued Starbucks China at roughly 10 times its anticipated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for 2025. This move by Starbucks comes amidst a period of decelerated growth and heightened competition from indigenous coffee brands within the competitive Chinese market. The potential sale is seen as a strategic step for Starbucks to recalibrate its presence and focus in this vital international territory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has finalized a trade agreement with Japan by signing an executive order, which formalizes a 15% baseline tariff on the majority of Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of this comprehensive deal, Japan has committed to investing $550 billion in US projects and significantly increasing its purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. This agreement, concluded after extensive negotiations, aims to mitigate the global supply chain disruptions previously caused by Trump's tariff policies, which had particularly impacted Japan's massive auto industry. The formalization of this trade pact coincides with a period of considerable political pressure for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing growing discontent and potential leadership challenges from within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

          <p>A recent study highlights a substantial increase in the demand for artificial intelligence skills, indicating that employers are prepared to offer significantly higher salaries for professionals who possess these capabilities. An extensive analysis of over a billion job postings by the labor insight platform Lightcast demonstrated that positions requiring at least one AI skill advertised salaries that were, on average, 28% higher than those without, with this premium rising to 43% for roles demanding two or more AI skills. Notably, the demand for AI expertise is particularly robust in non-tech sectors, including marketing, public relations, and customer support, challenging the perception that AI skills are solely relevant to IT roles. While some required AI skills are highly technical, general proficiencies, such as familiarity with ChatGPT, are becoming increasingly common. This trend underscores a pervasive need for AI literacy across a wide array of job functions and career areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US bankruptcy attorney, also named Mark S. Zuckerberg, is taking legal action against Facebook's parent company, Meta, claiming his account has been suspended five times over the past eight years. He alleges these shutdowns are due to false accusations of "impersonating a celebrity," leading to significant financial losses from his business and advertising. The Indiana lawyer, who has been practicing for 38 years—longer than the Facebook founder has been alive—states he has submitted multiple forms of identification to prove his authentic name. His account was reportedly only restored after the lawsuit was initiated. Meta has since acknowledged the error, confirming the account was disabled mistakenly, and is working to prevent such incidents in the future, underscoring the unusual difficulties of sharing a globally recognized name in the digital realm.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion, solidifying its position as the third-largest in US lottery history, following a series of drawings without a top prize winner. This article offers a comprehensive breakdown of Powerball data, including the challenging odds of winning—1 in 292.2 million—and an analysis of which numbers appear most and least frequently. A key focus is on the varying after-tax payouts for winners across the United States. Federal regulations stipulate a 24% withholding on lottery winnings exceeding $5,000, with an additional 14.6% due during tax season, bringing the total federal tax burden to approximately 37%. However, states such as California, Florida, New Hampshire, and Texas do not levy their own income tax on lottery prizes, meaning winners in these states could retain a significantly larger portion of their winnings compared to those in states with higher local taxes.</p>
