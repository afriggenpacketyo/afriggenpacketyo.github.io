          <h2>US Government Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:46:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced an unexpected government surplus of over $27 billion for June, a significant shift from May's $316 billion deficit. This positive turn was largely fueled by a 13% year-over-year increase in receipts, with customs duties surging by 301% compared to the previous year following new tariffs. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, and net interest on the national debt continues to be a major expense, totaling $84 billion for the month.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors are exploring ways to generate additional income. This article details three potential options for homeowners aged 62 or older to consider for supplementing their funds. These include reverse mortgages, which provide payments from home equity, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump sum. A third, less favorable option discussed is taking out a personal loan to cover financial gaps or create an emergency fund. (not investment advice)</p>

The aid, funded by philanthropic partners rather than city money, will be distributed via cash cards to help people who are afraid to leave their homes or go to work. The initiative is part of a broader city response that includes an executive order to bolster LA's sanctuary city policies. The city will also seek records from ICE regarding the raids to better understand their scope and impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely accepted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number itself is somewhat arbitrary, health experts note that it coincidentally aligns with public health guidelines for physical activity, equating to about five miles of walking. Recent studies suggest health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500 to 3,000 per day, with significant gains plateauing around 7,500 steps. The consensus is that any movement is beneficial, and using the goal as a motivator is positive.</p>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, this article outlines four potential relief options. These include credit counseling, which can lead to a structured debt management plan with lower interest rates, and credit card debt forgiveness, where a lump-sum payment can settle a debt for less than the full amount. The article also discusses credit card hardship programs, which may offer temporary relief like paused payments, and bankruptcy as a last resort for overwhelming debt. Each strategy comes with its own set of qualifications and potential consequences for one's credit. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal is to reduce the number of "fit notes" that declare people unfit for work by providing proactive support. The government is funding the initiative in 15 regions, aiming to change the focus from what patients cannot do to how they can be supported. The scheme is part of a broader government effort to decrease the number of people out of the workforce due to long-term health conditions.</p>
