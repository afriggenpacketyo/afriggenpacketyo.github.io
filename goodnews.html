          <h2>Supreme Court Sides With Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Texas Waste Storage Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:13:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh stated that Texas and the land developer weren't parties to the licensing process, thus lacking entitlement to judicial review. The ruling reverses the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision. The issue of nuclear waste storage has been politically complicated, with the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada stalled due to state pushback, leaving over 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in private storage. The case hinged on whether Texas and the landowners had the standing to challenge the license initially. The current ruling enables Interim Storage Partners to store nuclear waste in Andrews County, Texas. Optimism regarding the long-term solution to nuclear waste storage remains tempered by the ongoing political and logistical challenges. </p>

          <p>The Senate's tax plan for President Trump's spending package aims to permanently extend the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This would result in most taxpayers seeing a tax cut, according to the Tax Foundation. Both the Senate and House versions of the bill extend the 2017 tax cuts, while also introducing new tax breaks. The bills differ in areas such as Medicaid rules, state and local tax deduction limits, and clean energy tax credits. The final version of the budget bill will determine the extent of the tax breaks for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>
