          <p>China has agreed to begin taking steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, according to Tokyo. This development follows a period of strained relations and import restrictions. Further details regarding the specific steps and timeline for the resumption of imports were not immediately available in the article, but the agreement signifies a potential thaw in trade relations between the two countries, with potential positive implications for the Japanese seafood industry. The resumption of trade could also ease some of the economic pressures faced by Japanese fishermen and seafood producers who have been impacted by the import ban, which had been in place for an unspecified period prior to this agreement. The agreement marks a significant step towards normalizing trade relations and fostering economic cooperation between China and Japan.</p>

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film 'Sinners' in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set. The screening was organized following a community petition, as Clarksdale lacks a movie theater. Coogler expressed his connection to Mississippi, noting his family's roots in the state and how working on the script changed him. The film, a supernatural vampire flick set in 1930s Clarksdale, was well-received by the local audience, who appreciated the homage to Mississippi Delta culture, and the event included a Q&A session with Coogler and other members of the cast and crew.</p>

          <h2>Gap Shares Drop as Tariffs Could Cost Retailer Millions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 18:52:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gap Inc. anticipates that new tariffs could negatively impact its business by $100 million to $150 million if they remain in effect, causing shares to plummet. The company is working to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its reliance on China. CEO Richard Dickson stated that Gap plans to increase cotton purchases from the U.S. to further offset the tariff impact. Despite the tariff concerns, Gap's first-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded expectations, driven by strong performances from Old Navy and the Gap brand, the latter seeing sales of $724 million, up 5% compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Costco reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter, with sales increasing by 8% year-over-year. The warehouse club's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, while revenue reached $63.21 billion. Despite concerns about tariffs potentially raising consumer prices, Costco is actively seeking ways to mitigate these costs, such as rerouting goods and sourcing more private-label items domestically. The company's strategy of offering competitive prices and bulk discounts, along with discounted gas and groceries, continues to attract customers and drive membership renewals.

Sable, however, maintains that it is only repairing existing pipelines and does not require new permits, and the ruling comes shortly after Sable announced the resumption of offshore oil production, further angering environmentalists.</p>
