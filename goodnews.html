          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus, but with restrictions on who can receive it. The vaccine uses a lower dose by refining its immune target, and it has been shown to be safe and at least as effective as Moderna's existing vaccine in a study of over 11,000 people. The decision to limit the vaccine's use reflects skepticism from some officials about broad vaccination recommendations. The CDC has also changed its recommendations for children's COVID-19 vaccination, citing a review of data regarding safety and benefits.</p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can result in penalties that increase premiums for life; however, if you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying Medicare enrollment also allows your husband to continue making contributions on your behalf to his health savings account. Medicare suggests reaching out to the employer‚Äôs benefits department to confirm appropriate coverage and the ability to delay application.
