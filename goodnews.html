          <p>This article delves into some lesser-known aspects of Elon Musk's life, from his early ventures to his current endeavors. At age 12, Musk created a video game called Blastar, later selling it to a magazine for $500, demonstrating his early entrepreneurial spirit. He co-founded Zip2 with his brother, which was later sold for $300 million, netting Musk $22 million, and he also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair, which reportedly sold 10,000 bottles in a few hours. Musk's early company, X.com, eventually merged with Confinity to become PayPal, and his persona served as inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man, while he also aims to create an "everything app" with X, envisioning a platform similar to WeChat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as crucial "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. These tidal habitats, much of which have been lost to agriculture, are now being recognized for their role in nature's fight against climate change. The charity is advocating for these muddy areas to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals, which could incentivize further restoration and protection efforts. A study conducted with the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology revealed that plants in restored saltmarshes absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter, underscoring their significance in climate mitigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to choose separate surnames. The current law requires couples to share a single family name, traditionally resulting in women abandoning their maiden names. Despite growing public support, the passage of the opposition-submitted bills is unlikely during the current Diet session due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which fears the change would undermine family cohesion and traditional values. A Kyodo News poll indicated that 71 percent of respondents support the dual family-name system, highlighting a shift in public opinion.</p>

Japan has ruled out purchasing defense equipment from the U.S. in exchange for tariff easing, emphasizing that security and trade issues are separate matters. Core consumer prices in Tokyo have risen at the fastest pace in over two years, while the Trump administration accuses China of exploiting U.S. universities, and Japan's unemployment rate and industrial output remain largely unchanged. Japan also decided to lift some sanctions against Syria to aid in rebuilding efforts following the fall of Assad, and Akie Abe, widow of former PM Shinzo Abe, met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational corporations, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations in the stock market. These deals often utilize a newco structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate entity. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential payments of up to US$5 billion for licensing development and marketing rights for its drug candidates. This trend reflects a broader strategy among Chinese biotech firms to monetize their intellectual property as an alternative to traditional fundraising methods.</p>

Japanese officials said the two nations have agreed on "technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports" to China. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Earps is credited with changing the perception of women's goalkeeping and becoming a one-person global brand through her presence on the pitch and embrace of social media. Her decision to step back from international football is partly to focus on her club career, but her legacy includes leaving the game in a better place and making goalkeeping cool. She hopes to represent someone who has been through a lot and is still standing, encouraging others to do the same.</p>

Housden stated that the hawk has calmed down and that he intends to take Bomber Harris to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August before letting him loose in the autumn. Housden believes the hawk's behavior was likely hormonal or territorial, and he is committed to providing a stable environment for the bird.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions initiated by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and unlawfully enabling trading in crypto assets viewed as unregistered securities. This dismissal coincides with a broader shift in the U.S. government's approach to crypto regulation, marked by the Justice Department's closure of its crypto enforcement team and the potential appointment of a venture capitalist with crypto ties to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Binance has also forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project with links to the Trump family. (not investment advice)</p>
