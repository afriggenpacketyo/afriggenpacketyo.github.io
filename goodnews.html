          <p>A section of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-900 jet was discovered in a Raleigh, North Carolina, driveway after the aircraft safely landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The FAA confirmed the part belonged to Delta Flight 3247, which had departed from Atlanta. Despite the missing component, the plane landed without incident, and no injuries were reported among the 109 passengers and six crew members. Delta is cooperating with the ongoing investigation by the FAA to determine the cause of the detachment.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Asylum Ban at Southern Border</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy restricting migrants from seeking asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to implement an alternative immigration system. The judge acknowledged the executive branch's challenges but asserted that neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the President unilateral power to limit asylum rights. This decision, stayed for 14 days for appeal, is seen as critical for those fleeing danger.</p>
