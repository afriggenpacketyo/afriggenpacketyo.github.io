          <h2>Experts Clarify Primary Drivers of Mortgage Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 10:01:29 EDT</div>

          <p>Mortgage borrowers recently saw rates drop following a Federal Reserve cut, though they have since slightly rebounded, hovering near late 2022 lows. This article explores whether the Fed's rate decisions or the 10-year Treasury yield have a greater impact on mortgage rates. Experts largely agree that the 10-year Treasury yield is the primary driver, as its longer-term nature aligns more closely with the duration of most mortgages. While the Fed influences short-term borrowing costs and overall economic sentiment, the Treasury yield directly reflects investor demand in the bond market, influencing mortgage-backed securities. Institutional factors, such as cost of funds and liquidity, along with borrower-specific elements like credit scores, also play a role in determining individual mortgage rates.

          <p>As of October 10, 2025, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.49%, with 15-year mortgages averaging 5.87%, according to national data. This article provides current mortgage and refinance interest rates, noting that while rates are higher than a few years ago, good options remain for qualified borrowers. Experts advise strengthening credit profiles, shopping around for different lenders, and carefully considering loan terms and associated fees to secure favorable rates. Understanding these factors is crucial for both new homebuyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance in the current market environment, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive financial assessment.

Despite cool, wet weather, participants rode through the city streets and to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building. Organizers emphasized that "joy is a form of protest" and a form of resistance, aiming to speak out against federal intervention and promote mutual respect. This article highlights a unique and irreverent method of expressing dissent against governmental actions, reflecting Portland's distinct protest culture amidst ongoing political tensions and debates over federal authority.</p>

          <p>Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza celebrated the release of approximately 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 detainees by Israel, who had been held without charge. This significant release was part of a broader exchange deal that also saw 20 Israeli hostages freed by Hamas, forming a component of Donald Trump's peace plan. Many released prisoners appeared frail, with some alleging mistreatment and beatings during their detention, a claim that aligns with previous reports of inadequate food in Israeli prisons. The event, though marked by joy, also highlighted the ongoing pain and complex emotions within the Palestinian community.</p>

Concurrently, the White House has reportedly softened its rhetoric regarding fresh trade tensions, indicating a potential willingness for dialogue and a meeting between the two nations.
