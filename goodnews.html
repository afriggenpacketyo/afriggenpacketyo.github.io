          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, are leaving the firm to start their own law firm. This move follows criticism of Paul Weiss for reaching a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, has been widely criticized by associates, other firms, and Democrats, as Karp has been a major fund-raiser for Democrats and previously opposed Trump. The departing partners did not address the controversial deal in their email to colleagues, expressing gratitude for their time at the firm.</p>
