          <h2>Chinese Scientists Observe Quantum Friction Effect in Graphene for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has become the first to experimentally observe the effects of quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive phenomenon is linked to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear and tear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Princeton, Texas, a small city north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the country by the Census Bureau, ballooning from 17,000 to 37,000 residents in just a few years. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county median. However, this explosive growth has strained the city's infrastructure, forcing a temporary halt on new construction to allow roads, water, and sewer lines to catch up. The city is now racing to manage its expansion, with its population projected to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis legend Venus Williams was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the second round of the DC Open, ending her attempt to secure her first back-to-back match wins since 2019. Williams' first-round victory had made her the oldest woman to win a WTA tour-level match in two decades. The hard-court tournament marked her return to the sport after more than a year away due to surgery. Despite the loss, she received a standing ovation from the crowd, celebrating her enduring presence in the sport.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders NFL team for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, despite President Trump's recent threats to block any such agreement. Trump had demanded the team revert to its former "Redskins" name, a condition local officials have dismissed as a distraction. The agreement, which still requires council votes and congressional approval for the land use, is seen by city leaders as a major opportunity for jobs and investment. The deal framework includes significant revenue benefits for the district.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read a handwritten address, the letter isn't returned to sender; instead, an image of it is sent to the Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City. At this facility, hundreds of "data conversion operators" work around the clock to manually decipher the chicken scratch. These keyers process around 900 images per hour, ensuring that millions of otherwise undeliverable letters reach their intended destination. This unique operation serves as the last line of defense against poor penmanship in the mail system.</p>

          <p>A man working as a Chuck E. Cheese mascot at a Tallahassee, Florida, franchise was arrested on larceny charges while still in costume.

The stolen debit card was allegedly found in his pocket after police removed the oversized mascot head.</p>

          <p>Desmond Watson, an undrafted rookie defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and reportedly the heaviest player in NFL history, has been placed on the non-football injury list to start training camp.

The 6-foot-6-inch player, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, is working with a team nutritionist. The team has not set a specific target weight or a timetable for his return to practice.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new initiative to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration enforcement raids. The program taps into existing parish networks, originally developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, to serve vulnerable members of its community. The move comes as Archbishop José Gomez expressed deep concern for "good, hard-working" immigrants living in fear. The program has already received significant donations, including a $50,000 contribution from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and pop star Renée Rapp reflected on her reputation for being unfiltered and outspoken during media appearances. The "Mean Girls" star admits that while she finds traditional media training boring, she initially felt insecure when her candid personality became a viral trend. She also discussed the pressures of the music industry and the depression she experienced from being overworked. Her new single, "Leave Me Alone," was born from this frustration and serves as a witty response to those who have tried to tone her down.</p>

          <p>This political analysis suggests the 2028 Democratic presidential primary is unofficially underway, as several potential candidates are increasing their media visibility. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, including those with conservative or non-traditional audiences. This shift in media strategy appears to be a direct response to the party's 2024 loss, with a focus on reaching new voters and adopting a more moderate, sometimes left-punching, tone on cultural issues. The early moves signal an effort to redefine the party's message and appeal.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies like Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are actually underspending on artificial intelligence, not overspending as some on Wall Street fear. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and increased investment is necessary to secure a dominant position, similar to how Google won the search engine market. Citing Alphabet's strong earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI infrastructure, Cramer believes the spending is urgent and justified to build the most profitable AI systems.

          <p>Food and technology companies are accelerating the development of natural food colorings as the industry moves away from synthetic dyes. The shift is driven by a recent FDA decision to ban Red Dye No. 3 and phase out other petroleum-based dyes amid health concerns. Firms like Fermentalg are using microalgae to create stable blue pigments, while others source colors from specially grown carrots and potatoes. While natural alternatives can be more expensive and present stability challenges, major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to reformulate their products.</p>
