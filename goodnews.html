          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old forward Cooper Flagg with the number one overall pick in the NBA Draft, making him the new cornerstone of the franchise. Flagg, a standout from Duke University, was the consensus college player of the year and is expected to make an immediate impact. He joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, who recently signed a new contract with the team. The selection of Flagg is seen as a pivotal moment for the Mavericks, helping the organization move forward after the surprising trade of Luka Donƒçiƒá earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Miami's 4-0 loss to his former club Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup, speculation has intensified about whether the match was Lionel Messi's final appearance on a major global stage. The 38-year-old Argentine star, whose contract with Inter Miami ends in 2025, showed flashes of his brilliance but was unable to turn the tide for his team. While his participation in the 2026 World Cup remains uncertain, analysts note that his family is settled in Miami, and he may extend his club stay. The article reflects on his legacy and current capabilities as he navigates the twilight of his historic career.</p>

          <p>The racing film "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt, has become a major box office hit for Apple, earning an estimated $55.6 million in its North American debut and $144 million globally. This marks the largest theatrical opening for Apple Original Films, which has previously had mixed results at the box office. The film, produced by much of the team behind "Top Gun: Maverick," was made with a large budget of over $200 million and distributed in partnership with Warner Bros. Strong positive reviews and an "A" CinemaScore from audiences suggest the film may have sustained success in the coming weeks.</p>

          <h2>Assessing the True Impact of Airstrikes on Iran's Nuclear Program Requires Deeper Analysis</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic cautions against making hasty judgments about the effectiveness of the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, drawing parallels to historical "battle damage assessments." The article argues that while initial reports and political statements may vary, a true assessment takes time and considers factors beyond physical destruction, such as functional and indirect effects. It suggests that despite conflicting preliminary reports, the cumulative impact of the campaign was likely severe, targeting the entire nuclear ecosystem. The author posits that the use of advanced munitions and platforms against well-known targets likely resulted in significant, lasting damage to Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a recent interview that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a US ban over national security concerns. Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and that he would provide more details within two weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed confidence that President Xi Jinping would likely agree to the deal. The announcement comes as the administration has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest its US operations.</p>

Despite his age and a recent illness, he performed with gusto, adapting his vocals to his famously gravelly voice. He also took a moment to dedicate a song to Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis, who was brought on stage to celebrate his 90th birthday.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, successfully completed its 13th passenger spaceflight, carrying six tourists to the edge of space and back. The New Shepard rocket launched from West Texas, propelling the capsule and its crew to an altitude of over 65 miles, past the internationally recognized boundary of space. Passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly to space, experienced several minutes of weightlessness and viewed the Earth before the capsule returned for a parachute-assisted landing. The flight marks another milestone for the burgeoning space tourism industry, with Blue Origin having now flown a total of 74 passengers.</p>
