          <h2>Top UN Court Rules Nations Can Be Sued Over Climate Change Failures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 12:45:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice has affirmed that countries have a legal obligation to combat climate change and can be sued for failing to do so. The non-binding ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying island states that initiated the case out of frustration with global inaction. The court stated that existing international laws, including the Paris Agreement, require countries to implement their most ambitious climate plans. This decision could pave the way for future compensation claims against nations with high historical emissions, setting a new precedent in international environmental law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Japan, its fifth-largest trading partner, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese imports. This rate is lower than the previously threatened 25% but higher than the standard 10% for most imports. A key concession involves setting a 15% tariff on Japanese cars, a significant reduction from the 25% applied to vehicles from other nations. In return, Japan has agreed to open its markets to certain U.S. agricultural products and has pledged to invest $550 billion in the American economy, according to the White House.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan secured his second stage victory of this year's Tour de France, winning a sprint finish in stage 17. The 160.4km route concluded as expected with a bunch sprint after the final breakaway rider was caught with 4km remaining. A crash in the final kilometer involving rivals Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay occurred amidst heavy rain, clearing the way for Milan's dominant finish. The win strengthens the 24-year-old's hold on the green jersey for the points classification, while Tadej Pogacar safely retained the overall leader's yellow jersey with no changes in the general classification.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to be cautious of the revived "meme stock" phenomenon, as retail traders target companies like Kohl's and Krispy Kreme in apparent short squeezes. He contrasted this speculative trading with what he called legitimate ways to make money in the market. Separately, Cramer highlighted the strong performance of GE Vernova, which saw its stock soar over 15% following a positive earnings report, calling it a top story in the market. The commentary also touched on upcoming earnings for Honeywell and Dover, with analysts expressing optimism for Honeywell's report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek reelection for his House seat in New York's 17th Congressional District, ending speculation about a potential run for governor. Lawler stated that after deliberation, he concluded that running for reelection was the right decision for his family and district. He emphasized the critical importance of his seat for maintaining the Republican House majority, noting it was one of only three GOP-held seats won by Kamala Harris in the last election. The decision removes a potential challenger to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul and focuses attention on other potential GOP candidates like Elise Stefanik.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more consumers rely on credit cards amidst rising inflation, understanding minimum payments is crucial for managing debt. For a $2,000 balance with a 22% APR, the minimum payment typically ranges from $40 to $60, depending on the issuer's formula, which is often a percentage of the balance plus interest. While making the minimum payment keeps an account in good standing, it is an expensive long-term strategy due to compounding interest. Experts advise paying more than the minimum whenever possible to reduce the principal balance faster and save significantly on total interest charges over time.</p>

          <p>Uber is introducing a new feature that will allow women drivers and riders to request pairings with other women, aiming to enhance safety and comfort on the platform. The tool, which will be piloted in several U.S. cities next month, lets women passengers and drivers set a preference in their app settings. While not a guarantee, the company says it increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman match. This initiative expands on a similar feature previously rolled out to female drivers in approximately 40 other countries and is Uber's latest response to longstanding safety concerns on its platform.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With lenders tightening underwriting standards, qualifying for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more challenging. Financial experts advise that if an application is denied, the first step is to ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, homeowners should focus on reducing debt and boosting their credit score. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives include home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, though each has distinct requirements and potential drawbacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major legal reversal, the UK Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor interest rate. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their trials made the convictions unsafe, ending a decade-long battle by the traders to clear their names. They had long argued they were wrongly prosecuted for normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The ruling is a significant blow to the Serious Fraud Office, which will not seek a retrial, and could open the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>
