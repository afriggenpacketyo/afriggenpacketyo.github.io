          <h2>Trump Expected to Withdraw Surgeon General Nominee Amid Criticism</h2>

          <p>The White House is reportedly planning to withdraw Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General following criticism from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer questioned Nesheiwat's medical degree and her previous support for COVID-19 vaccines. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor, had initially promoted the COVID-19 vaccine but later opposed vaccine mandates for children. Trump had previously praised her as a strong advocate for preventive medicine. The withdrawal also comes amid scrutiny of Nesheiwat's brother-in-law, Mike Waltz, who was recently removed as Trump's national security advisor. Loomer has become increasingly influential in Trump's inner circle, offering recommendations on personnel decisions.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to maintain the Community Relations Service, an office created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, often called the "peacemakers program". The office's mission is to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders. Democrats argue the service combats violence and unrest, particularly after high-profile attacks on places of worship. The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and offers confidential, free services to communities. The office has worked to ease racial tensions in various cities, including after police shootings and during the trial of Derek Chauvin.</p>

          <p>Arm shares experienced a drop of over 8% in extended trading after the chip-design company released a weaker-than-anticipated forecast for the current quarter. While the company surpassed estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter, Wall Street is focusing on the company's outlook for the first quarter. Arm projects revenue between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. SoftBank controls roughly 90% of Arm, which went public in 2023 and has a market capitalization exceeding $130 billion. Arm's technology powers a significant portion of premium smartphones, with royalty revenue rising 18% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results. Griffin's concession ends his six-month effort to overturn the election in the swing state. The ruling by Judge Richard E. Myers II, appointed by former President Donald Trump, was a victory for Democrats. Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court. This outcome improves Democrats' prospects of regaining the majority of the seven-justice court in 2028.</p>

          <p>Ray Mendoza, a former Navy SEAL, co-wrote and directed the film 'Warfare' with Alex Garland, depicting a harrowing day during the Iraq War when his platoon was trapped in a building after an IED explosion. The film aims to accurately represent combat, focusing on the protocols, emotions, and intense bonds among soldiers. Mendoza sought to recreate the experience for a wounded SEAL, Elliott Miller, who lost his memory of the event. While the film is intense, it also offers a sense of closure and challenges stereotypes about veterans, emphasizing the importance of accurately portraying their experiences.</p>

          <p>Actor Jon Voight defended President Trump's plan to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, stating that "something has to be done" to revitalize the U.S. film industry. Voight, appointed as a "special ambassador to Hollywood" by Trump, believes the tariff would create more jobs for rank-and-file film workers. He cited a 40% reduction in film production in Los Angeles over the past decade due to incentives offered by other countries. While the White House has walked back the announcement, stating no final decisions have been made, Voight maintains the plan is to create a level playing field for the U.S. film industry.</p>

She also reveals diagnoses of dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which she says affect her speech. Baldwin describes the online backlash as fueled by misogyny and recounts feeling suicidal during the ordeal.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who presented a plan to "rescue" the American film industry.

While Trump's initial announcement lacked details, it sparked a debate about the film industry's struggles and potential policy solutions. Industry groups and unions have expressed mixed reactions, with some supporting efforts to increase U.S. production and others raising concerns about the impact on international film industries.</p>

They urged Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs serving Native communities have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions.
