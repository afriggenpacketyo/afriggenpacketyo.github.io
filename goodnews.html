          <h2>China Advances Next-Generation Nuclear Power with New Gigawatt Fast Reactor Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 00:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled the preliminary design for its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, known as the CFR-1000. This development marks a significant step forward in the country's plans for next-generation nuclear energy, which aims for greater fuel efficiency. The project is now awaiting final government approval and is expected to become operational after 2030. The announcement positions China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also actively developing advanced reactor technologies for more sustainable power generation.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Propose Using Sensor-Equipped Sharks to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are exploring an innovative method for gathering critical ocean data to improve hurricane forecasting by attaching sensors to sharks. This initiative, led by the University of Delaware in collaboration with NOAA, aims to use sharks as mobile data collectors for water temperature and conductivity, especially in areas inaccessible to traditional equipment. Since warm ocean temperatures fuel hurricanes, the data could provide vital insights into a storm's potential intensity and path. The project is currently testing mako and white sharks to see if they can effectively supplement existing weather monitoring systems.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:15:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak. The improved offensive performance comes as the team evaluates its needs ahead of the upcoming trade deadline, providing a much-needed boost for the club.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on difficulties faced by international PhD students in the United States to recruit top-tier talent. Stricter visa policies and university funding cuts under the Trump administration have made it harder for students to complete their studies, creating an opportunity for Chinese firms like Mingshi. These companies are offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers needed to develop advanced AI-driven trading strategies. This brain drain is helping fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is now the world's second largest.</p>

          <p>A small business owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, is being opposed by L'Oréal in her attempt to re-register her business's trademark. L'Oréal, which owns the 'Naked' makeup line under its Urban Decay brand, claims that the 'nkd' name could cause consumer confusion. Dowdeswell, who has already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of trading.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions caused a boom in aphids, which in turn provided an abundant food source for predators like ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation also reported an extraordinary year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to last year's record lows. However, experts caution that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to drying wetlands.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago over its sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that Chicago's laws illegally hindered federal immigration enforcement by limiting cooperation between local police and federal agents. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins stated that the city's policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the decision, affirming the city's commitment to its welcoming city ordinance.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were denied employment for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the 'Hollywood Ten,' a group of writers and directors who were jailed for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It explores the widespread impact of the anti-Communist fervor, which compelled many to name names to save their careers and expanded to ruin the lives of numerous artists. The exhibit raises questions about free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Texas's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease, wildlife biologists have undertaken a significant relocation project. After losing about half the state's population in five years, experts captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted, checked by veterinarians, and then moved over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, protected colony. Recent observations confirmed the success of the mission, with the relocated herd surviving and new lambs being born.</p>

          <p>A health report examines the scientific basis for popular daily wellness goals, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping seven to nine hours. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks provide useful guidance, there is often room for individual variation. For instance, thirst is generally a reliable indicator for hydration, and while seven hours of sleep is crucial, consistency is key. The article emphasizes that a holistic approach is more beneficial than rigidly fixating on specific numbers, encouraging people to incorporate a healthy outlook into their everyday lives.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on the unique ways the female body is affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once taboo, such as how breast biomechanics impact running performance and how the menstrual cycle can affect strength and injury risk. This new focus is leading to innovations like better-designed sports bras and training programs tailored to hormonal fluctuations. The shift marks a significant change from a past era when female athletes were often treated simply as 'mini-men' in terms of training and equipment.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the United States Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to reduce the public debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. This new, youth-friendly payment method has been added to the government's long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion, and while voluntary public contributions have historically been modest, the move to include Venmo offers a more accessible way for citizens to chip in. The government collected around $67 million in such donations since 1996.</p>
