          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from sales of specific AI chips to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses, which had previously been restricted due to national security concerns. President Trump confirmed the deal, describing it as a negotiation to benefit the country. This revenue-sharing model is highly unusual for corporate export licenses and comes after the administration approved the sale of Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were developed for the Chinese market.

This surge is occurring alongside gains in the U.S. equity markets as investors await key inflation data. Analysts suggest the crypto rally is fueled by increased buying during Asian trading hours and the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which boosts the appeal of hard assets. The positive momentum has also lifted the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. (not investment advice)</p>

While ESPN's app will be a comprehensive hub for all its live sports and programming, Fox One will stream content from its existing networks without exclusive originals, marking a strategic push into bundling for both media giants.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment complexes, and large bookstores. This strategy aims to transform malls into community hubs and drive "cross-shopping" from diverse visitor groups. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly who then patronize other mall businesses. This trend of subdividing large retail spaces and focusing on experiential offerings is helping once-declining enclosed malls to increase foot traffic and reinvent their purpose.</p>

          <p>In a major move following its merger with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC events will be available on the Paramount+ streaming service, effectively ending the pay-per-view model for its premium fights in the U.S. This deal represents a significant strategic investment for the newly merged Paramount, aiming to drive streaming subscriptions with a year-round, high-demand sports asset. TKO Group, UFC's parent company, views the move as a way to broaden its audience and modernize its distribution model.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service in late September, marking the end of an era for the technology that introduced millions to the online world. The iconic sound of the dial-up modem was a hallmark of the 1990s and early 2000s, when AOL became the dominant internet service provider with over 23 million subscribers at its peak. The service has since been eclipsed by faster broadband technologies like cable and fiber. Its discontinuation signifies the final retirement of a nostalgic piece of internet history for generations of early web users.</p>

She adopted the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated business world.

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield revealed a team with a rejuvenated and potent attack but a surprisingly open and vulnerable defense. New signings like Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz showed great promise, contributing to the team's offensive flair. However, the team's shift to a new 4-2-3-1 formation has created defensive gaps, which Crystal Palace exploited to draw the match and win on penalties. While it is still early in the season, the analysis suggests Liverpool may be more defensively fragile as they adapt to the new system and integrate several key new players.</p>

This guideline is aimed at protecting sleep, which is crucial for adolescent mental health and cognitive performance. Beyond preventing sleep disruption, keeping devices in common areas helps children develop a healthier relationship with technology by fostering better online decision-making and encouraging more family interaction. This single rule is presented as a practical and effective way for parents to "future-proof" their kids in a digitally saturated world.</p>
