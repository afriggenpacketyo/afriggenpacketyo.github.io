          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung convened for their first in-person summit, agreeing to enhance bilateral relations and promote high-level dialogue. They acknowledged the importance of addressing historical issues constructively while focusing on future cooperation across various sectors. Both leaders emphasized the significance of trilateral cooperation with the United States, particularly in response to North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, as well as Pyongyang's abductions of Japanese nationals. They also committed to "shuttle diplomacy" with reciprocal visits to each other's countries, building upon the improved relations fostered by their predecessors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Biden-appointed U.S. judge, Julia Kobick, has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy limiting U.S. passports to only male and female gender options. This policy, aligned with an executive order recognizing only two genders, eliminated the "X" designation and suspended the policy allowing individuals to identify as the opposite gender or as intersex or nonbinary. Judge Kobick stated that the policy discriminates based on sex, is arbitrary, and is rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans, arguing that it would cause psychological distress and fear for their safety when traveling with passports that conflict with their gender identity.</p>

          <p>Paul Taylor argues that European leaders should leverage NATO for their own security purposes, given the increasing U.S. focus on countering China and the unpredictability of U.S. commitments. He suggests that while maintaining American involvement is crucial for deterring Russian aggression, Europe must develop its own defense capabilities and strategies. This includes maximizing the use of NATO's command structure and collective defense planning to prepare for potential actions without U.S. support. Taylor proposes that a European-led coalition could provide security guarantees for Ukraine, highlighting the need for Europe to be ready to take the steering wheel.</p>
