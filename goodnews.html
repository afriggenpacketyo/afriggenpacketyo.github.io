        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instagram has introduced new default content settings for teenagers, aiming for a "PG-13" level of content, which highlights the broader tech industry trend of segmenting the internet by age. This move is part of a larger push for regulation like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) to protect young users from harmful material and addictive algorithms. However, the article argues that creating separate internets for different age groups faces significant hurdles, including flawed age verification technologies and risks to privacy and free speech. The effort reflects a growing concern over the impact of digital media on youth mental health.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is drawing national attention with three distinct candidates set to debate: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, is leading in polls with a highly progressive platform, while Cuomo seeks a political comeback after his 2021 resignation amid a sexual harassment scandal. The debate is expected to focus on key urban issues like affordable housing and the city's budget deficit, presenting voters with starkly different visions for the future of the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a peace plan between Israel and Hamas, Germany is positioning itself to play a significant humanitarian and diplomatic role in Gaza's future. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged €29 million in immediate aid and indicated a much larger sum will be available for reconstruction, with Germany co-hosting a donor conference with Egypt. However, Berlin has ruled out sending troops for any stabilization mission. The ceasefire has also renewed debate within Germany about resuming full weapons exports to Israel, a decision the government is approaching cautiously pending further developments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law to decriminalize euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so through legislative action. The law allows individuals with incurable illnesses causing "unbearable suffering" to seek a medically-assisted death, even if their condition is not terminal. The move positions Uruguay, a highly secular nation, at the forefront of social policy in the predominantly Catholic region, following earlier pioneering laws on marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The legislation was passed despite opposition from the Catholic Church and reinforces the country's reputation for socially liberal policies.</p>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously honored Irish writer Oscar Wilde by reissuing his reader's card, 130 years after it was rescinded following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." The original card was revoked due to his imprisonment for homosexual relationships, which were criminalized at the time. The library stated the gesture is intended to acknowledge the "immense suffering and injustices" Wilde endured. Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, will collect the new card on what would have been the writer's 171st birthday, calling it a "lovely gesture of forgiveness."</p>

          <p>Paxos, the company that issues PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin, mistakenly created $300 trillion worth of the digital currency due to a "technical error" during an internal transfer. The amount, more than double the estimated global GDP, was quickly identified and the excess tokens were "burned," or permanently removed from circulation, within about 20 minutes. Paxos confirmed that no customer funds were at risk and there was no security breach. The incident highlights the operational risks in the digital asset space and underscores that stablecoin pegs are maintained by their issuers rather than being intrinsic to the minting process.</p>

          <p>The annual ShakeOut earthquake drill emphasizes the importance of safety protocols for residents in seismically active regions like California. Experts advise that during an earthquake, the safest action is to "drop, cover, and hold on" under a sturdy object, as most injuries are caused by falling items or moving around. Running outside is discouraged, as falling debris near buildings poses a significant danger. The article also highlights the availability of the MyShake app for early warnings and provides tips for securing homes by strapping down furniture and retrofitting older buildings to better withstand seismic activity.</p>

          <h2>California Passes Bill to Expedite Research on Psychedelics for Treating Veteran PTSD</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating mental health conditions like PTSD and depression, particularly among veterans. Sponsored by the nonprofit VETS, the new law streamlines the approval process for research involving Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin. It allows studies already approved by the FDA to bypass a lengthy state-level review panel, potentially shortening delays by months. This move reflects a growing recognition of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, which have shown promising results in reducing symptoms of trauma and depression in clinical studies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, 43, is increasingly seen as a potential challenger to Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 mayoral election. Since being elected to the powerful board in 2022, Horvath has taken on high-profile initiatives, including fundamentally restructuring county government and changing its approach to homelessness. Her recent move into the city of Los Angeles and public tensions with Mayor Bass have intensified speculation about her ambitions. While Horvath has not confirmed any plans to run, she acknowledges that she is being encouraged by key stakeholders and is seriously considering their requests.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government has narrowly survived two no-confidence votes in parliament, averting an immediate collapse. The key to survival was Lecornu's promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's highly controversial pension reform until after the 2027 presidential election, a move that secured enough support from opposition parties. While the government remains in power, the close vote underscores the fragility of Macron's administration, which lacks a majority in the deeply divided National Assembly. The government now faces another challenge with upcoming debates on a new austerity budget.</p>
