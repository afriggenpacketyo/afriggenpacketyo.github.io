          <p>Google and Kairos Power are collaborating to deploy an advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee by 2030 to power Google's data centers. The Tennessee Valley Authority has agreed to purchase power from the Hermes 2 reactor, marking the first U.S. utility to sign such an agreement with an advanced reactor developer. This project aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology, with Google and Kairos bearing the initial financial risks to avoid costs for consumers. The plant represents a significant step toward using reliable, carbon-free energy to meet the growing demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Tom Barrack announced that discussions for a ceasefire agreement with Israel will proceed after Lebanon's government endorsed a U.S.-backed plan for the disarmament of Hezbollah. The plan aims to resolve long-standing conflict at the border, with Washington also preparing an economic proposal for post-war reconstruction in Lebanon. The move has angered the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has vowed to resist disarmament, raising fears of potential civil unrest. This diplomatic effort follows months of cross-border combat and represents a significant step towards stabilizing the volatile region.</p>

          <p>The trend of workers frequently changing jobs for better opportunities, known as the 'great resignation,' has been replaced by 'job hugging,' where employees hold onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty. Organizational consultants note that key labor market indicators like hires, quits, and layoffs are all low, suggesting stagnation. This shift is driven by a cooling job market and fears about the difficulty of finding new employment. While providing stability, experts warn that this trend could lead to career stagnation and lower wage growth for individuals who remain in their roles for too long.</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Erin intensifies in the Atlantic, this article provides a breakdown of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which classifies storms from Category 1 to 5 based on sustained wind speeds. The scale helps estimate the potential for property damage, with storms of Category 3 or higher designated as 'major' hurricanes capable of causing catastrophic harm. The explainer details the wind speeds and expected damage for each category, citing historical examples like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ian. It clarifies that while there is no official Category 6, the concept is discussed by scientists due to increasingly extreme storms.</p>

          <p>Indian financial markets rallied following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of significant tax reforms, including simplifying the goods and services tax (GST) structure. The proposed changes are expected to boost domestic consumption and key sectors like manufacturing and automotive, providing a buffer against economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs. This focus on strengthening the domestic economy is seen as a strategic move to offset the impact of Washington's planned 50% duties on Indian imports. Analysts believe the stimulus from the tax overhaul could be substantial, given that domestic consumption is the primary driver of India's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has launched a new recruitment initiative that uses social media influencers to reach potential Gen Z recruits. The strategy involves partnerships with lifestyle content creators, such as fitness experts and chefs, who create sponsored posts depicting their experiences with military training and activities. This modern approach aims to increase the army's visibility among younger audiences who may have limited exposure to military life. The campaign comes as the military seeks to rebound from recent recruitment shortfalls by presenting service as a path to stability and personal growth in an appealing, authentic format.</p>

          <h2>America's Growing Appetite for Spicy Foods Transforms the Culinary Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are embracing spicy food at an unprecedented rate, a trend driven by younger generations and the global fusion of culinary traditions. Over half of U.S. consumers now report they are likely to purchase spicy items, a significant increase from a decade ago. This 'spice creep' is fueled by several factors, including the use of spice as a cost-effective way to add flavor, increased familiarity with international cuisines, and the viral nature of 'hot challenges' on social media. From Flamin' Hot snacks to Carolina Reaper-infused dishes, the American palate is adapting to and demanding ever-increasing levels of heat.</p>

          <h2>Director Francis Ford Coppola Embarks on Tour to Build a Following for His Film 'Megalopolis'</h2>

          <p>Famed director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a six-city tour to promote and discuss the themes of his 2024 film, 'Megalopolis,' in an unusual effort to build a cult following for the project. The film, a passion project self-funded by Coppola for $120 million, was a critical and commercial failure upon its release. The live events, billed as 'An Evening with Francis Ford Coppola,' feature the director engaging in long, unmoderated discussions on broad topics like politics, art, and society. This direct attempt by a creator to facilitate a cult legacy is unconventional, as such followings typically emerge organically from audience devotion over time.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has announced he will run for the Senate again in 2026 to represent Ohio, less than a year after losing his reelection campaign. Brown, who had been the only Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio, was defeated in November 2024 in a key race that helped Republicans take control of the Senate. In his announcement, he stated he was running to 'stand up for workers' and make a difference for the state. He is expected to face Republican Senator Jon Husted in a special election for the seat previously held by Vice President JD Vance.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This will be the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel. The initiative follows a letter from a cross-party group of MPs urging the government to act without delay to save children at risk due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>During last week's summit in Anchorage, Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted a new Ural motorcycle to a local resident named Mark Warren. The gesture came after Russian state television reporters met Warren by chance and he mentioned his difficulty in obtaining spare parts for his older Ural bike. An employee from the Russian embassy presented the new motorcycle to a speechless Warren as a 'personal gift' from President Putin. The motorcycle company, Ural, was founded in Soviet Russia but moved all its production out of the country to Kazakhstan following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
