          <p>Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. The S&P/ASX 200 index edged down 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar. This is despite most Asian markets being closed for public holidays and U.S. futures also trending downwards after a strong week on Wall Street. This move indicates Australians' desire for policy continuity amid the current uncertain macroeconomic outlook.</p>

          <p>Monday's UK newspapers are dominated by stories of counter-terrorism police raids across England, resulting in eight arrests related to separate investigations into a major attack plot. The Daily Telegraph highlights renewed calls to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp following the arrests of seven Iranian men. Several papers also focus on the government's reaction to Reform UK's success in local elections, with Downing Street planning to tackle immigration to counter Nigel Farage's party.

          <p>A New York Times analysis examines how President Trump's policies and presence are impacting elections worldwide, with mixed results. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties have gained ground by campaigning against Trump-like policies, while in Singapore, stability during turmoil linked to Trump's trade wars has aided incumbents. However, in Germany, the effect is less direct but still felt, and in Britain, a center-left leader initially praised for handling Trump now faces challenges. These elections suggest a complex global reaction to Trump's policies and leadership style.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing Popularity Increases Among Young Women Seeking to Preserve Fertility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of women freezing their eggs has surged, driven by the desire to preserve fertility and delay motherhood. Egg freezing offers women the option to postpone having children until they are ready, without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. However, experts caution that it is not a guarantee and involves costs, medical risks, and potential disappointment. The optimal time to freeze eggs is in a woman's 20s, when egg quality is at its peak. Some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, while others are criticized for potentially exploiting women's desire to prioritize their careers.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood, but it comes with significant financial costs and no guaranteed success. The procedure involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, freezing, and later, thawing and fertilization. Doctors emphasize that it is not a sure thing and the process can be emotionally and financially taxing. Despite the criticisms, more women are choosing to freeze their eggs, seeing it as a way to take control of their reproductive futures.</p>

          <p>According to estimates by estate agency Savills, more than half of first-time buyers in the UK received financial assistance from their families to purchase homes last year. The average contribution from the "bank of mum and dad" was ¬£55,572, provided through loans and gifts. This support enabled young buyers to navigate high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. The report suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received family assistance, slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013.</p>

Later in life, he worked as a shipping clerk at NBC and wrote essays about his experiences in show business. The show was about a man of the Wild West who seemed so unsuited to shootouts and cattle wrangling that he cannot be called even a ‚Äútenderfoot.</p>
