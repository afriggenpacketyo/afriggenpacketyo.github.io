          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a drop following the announcement of a more than 30% decline in net income, which fell to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion, or $2.97 per share, in the same period last year. The decline is attributed to a steep decrease in oil prices, with U.S. crude oil prices falling approximately 18% this year. Capital expenditures also saw a reduction of about 5%, totaling $3.9 billion, down from $4.1 billion the previous year, but the company returned $6.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a fine of 530 million euros ($601.3 million) on TikTok for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law. The fine is a result of TikTok's transferring of European user data to China without ensuring an equivalent level of protection as guaranteed within the EU. The DPC has ordered TikTok to rectify its data processing practices within six months and cautioned that transfers to China would be suspended if compliance is not achieved within the stipulated timeframe. The regulator also found that TikTok had provided inaccurate information during the inquiry regarding the storage of European users' data on servers in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone the planned legislation to criminalize misogyny until after next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, the government intends to amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. Additionally, legislation to end conversion therapy will not be pursued this term, with the government hoping for a UK-wide solution to the issue.</p>

The ruling, made by Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., states that President Trump's use of the act exceeds its intended purpose, as the alleged actions of Tren de Aragua members do not constitute an "organized armed attack" or an attempt by Venezuela to attack the US. This ruling is the first permanent injunction to address the use of the AEA to deport migrants alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua.</p>
