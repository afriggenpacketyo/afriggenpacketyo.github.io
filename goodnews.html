          <p>A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students after Harvard filed a lawsuit arguing the move was a blatant violation of law and free speech rights. The administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism, allegations the university denied, and White House officials accused the judge of having a liberal agenda after the ruling. International students at Harvard, who comprise over 27% of the student body, expressed concerns about being forced to transfer or return home, as losing access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program would violate their visas. Eliminating foreign students would also significantly impact Harvard's finances, as they often pay full tuition, subsidizing aid for American students.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 'planned partnership' between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, claiming it will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and create at least 70,000 jobs. Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel had been blocked by former President Joe Biden, but Trump subjected it to another national security review. U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, stating the partnership would bring massive investment and new technologies, while Nippon Steel echoed the commitment to American workers and national security. The United Steelworkers union, which had opposed the deal, had no immediate comment, and shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly undertaking a major restructuring of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), significantly reducing its size and scope. Staff dealing with various geopolitical issues received termination notices, with the intention of granting more authority to the State Department, the Defense Department, and other agencies. The aim is to reduce the NSC staff to just a few dozen people, down from hundreds, as the NSC is the main body used by presidents to coordinate national security strategy. While the NSC staffers who are cut from the agency will be moved to other positions in government, the restructuring is expected to impact the agency's ability to address complex global challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including advanced small reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050, declaring a "national energy emergency" to meet growing electricity needs, particularly for data centers. While nuclear power enjoys bipartisan support, concerns remain about safety and waste disposal, and critics fear the White House pressure could cause the NRC to take shortcuts on safety.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned President Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm employing an attorney who investigated him, deeming it unconstitutional. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government facilities and federal contracting work, with Trump accusing the firm of undermining justice. Judge John D. Bates ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, asserting that it targeted Jenner & Block based on its causes, clients, and a former employee. The ruling mirrors a similar decision against an executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie, and the Justice Department has defended Trump's executive orders as consistent with presidential authority.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempt to block international students from attending Harvard University, responding to a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued that the administration's action, which revoked the university's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, was retaliatory and would cause immediate and irreparable harm. The lawsuit accused the administration of exerting pressure on Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights, and cited the administration's demands for records of protest activity and disciplinary actions involving international students. The White House responded by accusing Harvard of not doing enough to combat antisemitism, while the wider academic community expressed shock at the administration's move.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of older Americans, and risk increases with age. Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting, and physical therapy may also be used to improve gait stability. The prognosis depends on when the disease is diagnosed, with early diagnosis leading to better outcomes.</p>

Carlucci envisions Bay Street as the main walkable corridor connecting Riverfront Plaza to the sports and entertainment district, and wants to emphasize residential development to bring more life to downtown. The proposal seeks to shift the city's development approach by creating a dedicated funding source for a targeted area, rather than reacting to individual projects.</p>
