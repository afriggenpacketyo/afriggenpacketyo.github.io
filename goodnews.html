        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil fell 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed 7.18% to settle at $71.48. Prices are now at their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. The oil market selloff indicates that investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after the U.S. strikes on Iran. The optimism score reflects the market's reaction to the potential for reduced conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Super Micro Computer shares fell approximately 6% after the company announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The stock decline is typical upon such announcements due to potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes upon conversion. Super Micro plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, and will repurchase $200 million of its stock from note issuers. Despite the drop, Super Micro shares are still up nearly 40% this year, driven by high demand for Nvidia's AI processors. The optimism score reflects the company's strong position in the AI market despite the recent stock dip. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has instructed staff not to use Meta's WhatsApp due to concerns over data privacy and security. The House's chief administrative officer (CAO) cited a lack of transparency regarding WhatsApp's data practices as the reason for the ban. Staff members are prohibited from downloading WhatsApp on government devices or accessing it on personal devices for official business. Meta responded, disagreeing with the CAO's characterization and highlighting WhatsApp's encrypted nature.

          <p>Jofra Archer returned to cricket for Sussex, marking his first appearance in whites since May 2021. Archer's opening spell was accurate, but his second spell caught the eye with pacey deliveries. He trapped Durham opener Gay in front, celebrating his first wicket in whites in over four years. Archer's performance suggests he is in England's thoughts for the summer, potentially for the India Test. The optimism score is high, reflecting Archer's successful return and potential for future appearances. </p>

          <p>An extreme heat wave is affecting much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures expected to exceed 100¬∞F in many areas. Experts warn that prolonged extreme heat can be dangerous, especially for those without air conditioning or spending time outdoors. To protect against heat-related illness, it's important to stay cool and indoors, stay hydrated with water and electrolytes, protect your skin with sunscreen and protective clothing, and learn the signs of heat illness. Recognizing and acting on symptoms of heat exhaustion can prevent more serious conditions like heat stroke. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the potential dangers of the heat wave but also the availability of preventative measures. </p>
