        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a deal valued at £60 million, including add-ons. The 27-year-old, who began his youth career with Arsenal, chose to rejoin the club despite having also agreed to terms with rival Tottenham Hotspur. The move marks Arsenal's seventh signing of the summer transfer window. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Eze as a powerful and exciting player who will add a new dimension to the team's attack, highlighting his work ethic and mentality as key attributes that align with the club's values.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team delivered a commanding performance, defeating Wales with a record 30-point margin in their World Cup opening match. Despite recent off-field turmoil regarding player contracts, the Scottish team appeared united, scoring six tries in front of a record crowd in Salford. Francesca McGhie was named player of the match after scoring a hat-trick, leading her team to a decisive victory. The result was a significant disappointment for Wales, who were outmatched in nearly every aspect of the game and will need to regroup before their next match against Canada.</p>

          <p>Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium spurred a significant rally in the stock market, particularly benefiting non-tech, cyclical stocks. Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts, which investors interpreted as a positive sign for economically sensitive sectors, leading to gains in companies like DuPont and Home Depot. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new record high, the tech-heavy Nasdaq still posted a weekly loss, as major tech firms are seen as less dependent on borrowing costs and more on the artificial intelligence boom. The market's positive reaction suggests renewed confidence in consumer discretionary spending if rates are lowered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to experience a late-summer heatwave, with temperatures potentially reaching 30°C on the bank holiday Monday. The warmth is attributed to tropical air being pushed towards the UK by the remnants of Hurricane Erin. This pleasant weather is expected for major weekend events like the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals. However, the heat will be short-lived, as the storm system is predicted to bring more unsettled and cooler weather with wind and rain starting from Tuesday and persisting for much of the week.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 11:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A street in central Berlin, previously named Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse after a lengthy legal battle. The original name was considered racist due to its historical connection to the enslavement of Africans who were brought to Germany as "court moors." The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanian-born philosopher who became the first African scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. Civil society groups, who had campaigned for the change for decades, celebrated the renaming as a significant step in decolonizing public spaces and acknowledging Black history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has significantly expanded a previous order, now blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Orrick adds major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago to the list of protected municipalities. The judge had previously deemed it unconstitutional for the administration to freeze funding based on these policies. This decision marks another legal setback for the administration's efforts to compel local governments to comply with its federal immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again on Hawaii's Big Island, shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air. This marks the 31st such event since December, with the eruption contained entirely within the summit crater of Halemaumau, posing no threat to homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is providing live camera feeds of the spectacle, which has become a significant draw for visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that the frequent, episodic fountaining is caused by magma building up in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface.</p>

          <p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has framed the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum not as a technological one, but as a philosophical decision about the future. He argues that Ethereum prioritizes speed and rapid development, making it agile for applications like DeFi and NFTs. In contrast, Dorsey describes Bitcoin as deliberately slower, prioritizing decentralization, stability, and security above all else, which he views as a feature, not a flaw. He poses the question of whether future generations would be better served by a system that is fast or one that is fundamentally secure and robust.</p>

          <p>A new FDA-approved technology called the Vivistim System is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The system involves a small implant that stimulates the vagus nerve during physical therapy, which is believed to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself and improve motor function. Ohio restaurateur Tommy Fello, who had lost movement in his left side after a stroke, became the first patient at the Cleveland Clinic to receive the implant and has since made significant progress. This first-of-its-kind technology is being hailed by medical experts as a major advancement in stroke rehabilitation.</p>

          <h2>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's Wardrobe Shift Signals Diplomatic Tone Change</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article from NPR explores the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" through Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House. After a previous combative meeting where his casual, military-style shirt drew criticism, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt for his latest meeting with President Trump. This sartorial shift was interpreted as a deliberate message to engage in serious, high-stakes diplomacy rather than maintaining a pure wartime posture. The change in attire was noted positively by both President Trump and the press, potentially contributing to what Zelenskyy himself called his "best one" visit yet.</p>
