          <p>Miyu Yamashita of Japan has won her first major golf championship at the Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, finishing two strokes ahead of England's Charley Hull. The 24-year-old demonstrated remarkable composure throughout the final round, carding a two-under 70 to maintain the lead she established on Friday. Despite a persistent challenge from Hull, Yamashita's consistent play, including crucial par saves, secured her the victory and a $1.462 million prize. This win marks a significant milestone in her career and makes her the third Japanese player to win the historic tournament.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was reported in the New York City area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents in the region reported feeling brief shaking, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause significant issues. This event follows a much larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the East Coast in April 2024, which was one of the strongest in the region in the last century. Officials have reassured the public that minor quakes are not unusual.</p>

An extraordinary fourth day saw England, chasing a record 374, reach 339-6 before rain and bad light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's bowlers, which saw three quick wickets fall, turned the match on its head. The tension-filled finale at The Oval will decide the series, with England currently leading 2-1.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a 22-year-old caller with $43,000 in stocks to focus on immediate life goals before aggressively saving for retirement. The young man, who earns a low income and lives with his parents, was concerned about choosing between a Roth or traditional IRA. Ramsey suggested the caller's priority should be to secure a career and move out on his own, calling this a necessary transitional phase. He also cautioned against the risk of holding the majority of his assets in single stocks, recommending a shift to mutual funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy options to their menus in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell have recently launched new spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, recognizing the younger generations' preference for bold and adventurous flavors. This trend is a low-cost, high-return strategy for brands to generate buzz and re-engage consumers amid a slowdown in spending. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a key role in popularizing these spicy items, with trends and challenges driving customer interest and trial.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix with a masterful defensive drive, holding off a late charge from his teammate Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy after falling to fifth on the opening lap, which put him in the lead but required him to manage his tires carefully. Piastri, on fresher tires, closed the gap in the final laps but was unable to execute an overtake on the difficult track. The win reduces Norris's deficit to Piastri in the championship standings to just nine points heading into the summer break.</p>

          <p>New York's JFK International Airport is undergoing a massive $19 billion overhaul, with its new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 taking shape ahead of a planned mid-2026 opening. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest and dedicated solely to international travelers, is now weather-tight, with key infrastructure like baggage systems being installed. Designed to be flooded with natural light, the facility will place departures, security, and customs on the same level. Upon completion in 2030, it will feature 23 gates, over 300,000 square feet of commercial space, and its own resilient microgrid for power.</p>

          <h2>China Approves 183 Brazilian Coffee Exporters Following New U.S. Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:44:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 new Brazilian coffee companies, a significant move that comes as the United States prepares to implement a 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other products. This decision provides a crucial alternative market for Brazilian exporters, who sell approximately 8 million bags of coffee to the U.S. annually. While the U.S. remains a much larger market for Brazilian coffee currently, this expansion into China could help mitigate the economic impact of the steep American tariffs. China is already Brazil's top overall trade partner, strengthening economic ties between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary showed what looked like a successful take-off from the carrier. This drill marks a significant milestone for the Fujian, which is China's first carrier to be equipped with this advanced launch technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The vessel is expected to officially enter service with the Chinese navy later this year.</p>
