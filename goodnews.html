          <p>President Trump has declared an end to the Israel-Hamas war following a historic exchange of remaining Israeli hostages for over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. While the initial steps of the 20-point peace plan have been celebrated, Middle East experts caution that significant hurdles remain for achieving lasting peace. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of an international body to govern the territory, making the path forward complex and fragile.</p>

          <p>Following claims from the White House suggesting a link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, medical experts are refuting these and other related assertions. Doctors and researchers have clarified that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that Amish communities have no autism due to avoiding medications, noting they do use Tylenol. Experts also dismissed unverified rumors of pregnant women taking excessive doses in protest and reaffirmed that acetaminophen, when used correctly, is considered the safest option for pain and fever relief during pregnancy and for children.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Candid New York" compiles the groundbreaking work of George Bradford Brainerd, a 19th-century civil engineer and photographer. In the 1870s, Brainerd developed early handheld cameras that allowed him to capture spontaneous and detailed scenes of everyday life on the streets of New York. Often called the 'father of instantaneous photography,' his images document a diverse range of city inhabitants, from musicians and paperboys to beggars. The book, authored by Erik Hesselberg, offers a unique visual record of the era and is set for release on October 21st.</p>

          <p>A new study by DHL and NYU's Stern School of Business suggests that global trade has proven resilient against the Trump administration's tariff hikes and is not currently reversing. The research forecasts that global trade volume will grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but slower than earlier predictions. Despite a surge in shipments in early 2025 ahead of tariff implementations, growth is expected to slow significantly next year before stabilizing, indicating that globalization is adapting rather than collapsing.

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is championing a targeted prostate cancer screening program for men at the highest risk, arguing it could save countless lives. A report from Prostate Cancer Research, a charity for which Sunak is a patron, proposes focusing on Black men and those with a family history of the disease. While advocates argue that modern testing methods like MRI scans have improved reliability, some medical experts remain cautious, citing concerns about over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment for slow-growing cancers.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte publicly ridiculed the condition of a Russian submarine, the Novorossiysk, which was seen surfaced and under tow in the English Channel and North Sea. While Russia's Black Sea Fleet claimed the surfacing was for navigational compliance, Dutch authorities reported it was being towed, suggesting technical problems. Rutte quipped that the vessel was a "lone and broken Russian submarine limping home," contrasting its state with the formidable image portrayed in fiction. The incident occurs as an increasing number of Russian military vessels transit through the busy waterway.</p>

Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to help his father, who died from a cardiac arrest earlier this year, if he had been taught life-saving skills. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce the training, he is now campaigning for it to be implemented across Scotland, arguing that equipping young people with this knowledge could significantly improve survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is expected to report its third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating strong results driven by several positive trends. The bank is likely to have benefited from robust trading revenue spurred by market volatility from U.S. trade policies and a rebound in mergers and IPOs. Additionally, with stock market indices near record highs, the bank's wealth management division is also poised for a strong performance. These factors have contributed to large banks outperforming their regional counterparts throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>
