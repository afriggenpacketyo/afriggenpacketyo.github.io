Themes such as 'Distinction,' 'Jook,' 'Cool,' and 'Heritage' explore the evolution of the African diaspora's influence on fashion. A key piece in the exhibition is Frederick Douglass's tailcoat, symbolizing the power and eloquence of his voice and the broader significance of Black Americans' ability to express themselves through clothing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the two countries, although it is not a full trade deal. Key aspects of the agreement include a reduction in car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, the removal of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US, and continued negotiations on pharmaceuticals. The deal does not change the UK's digital services tax, which remains a point of contention, and maintains existing food standards, preventing the import of hormone-treated beef.</p>

          <p>Following a recent trade deal with the US, the UK government has affirmed that hormone-treated beef will not be permitted for import, despite concerns from farmers and consumers. The government insists that existing food standards will remain unchanged, and border checks will be conducted to ensure compliance. While the deal allows for increased beef imports from the US up to 13,000 metric tons tariff-free, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US at reduced tariffs. The agreement also includes provisions for lower tariffs on UK-made cars and US ethanol exports.</p>

          <p>Reality TV star Molly-Mae Hague has confirmed that she and Tommy Fury are back together after announcing their split last August, attributing the reconciliation to Fury's changed behavior. The pair, who met on Love Island in 2019, had previously cited Fury's drinking as a problem in their relationship. Hague stated that Fury has been sober for four months and that she believes the relationship is 'worth saving,' though she intends to take things slowly as they rebuild their family.</p>
