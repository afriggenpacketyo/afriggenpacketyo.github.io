          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed military academies to base all future admissions solely on merit, ensuring the "most qualified candidates" are admitted. He emphasized that factors like race, ethnicity, or sex should not be considered, and merit can be weighted by athletic talent, prior military service, or performance at preparatory schools. Hegseth asserts that selecting the best candidates is crucial for maintaining the military's lethality, warfighting readiness, and culture of excellence.

Due to a rocket malfunction, it remained in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back. Experts predict the re-entry will occur, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft is equipped with a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that some parts will survive the re-entry. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating mussels harvested along the California coastline. Biotoxins, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid, can accumulate in mussels during this period. Consuming toxic shellfish can be deadly, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine.</p>
