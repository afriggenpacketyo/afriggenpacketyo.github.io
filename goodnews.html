          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson and its affiliate Brickworks saw their stocks surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The deal aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and transparency. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company, with Brickworks shareholders receiving an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the previous closing price. The merger follows previous unsuccessful attempts to unwind the cross-shareholding, including efforts between 2012 and 2017. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the distribution of bonuses from the Club World Cup by wearing shirts reading ‚ÄúClub World Ca$h Grab‚Äù before their game against Minnesota United. The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) expressed solidarity, stating that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without considering their well-being. FIFA will pay MLS teams approximately $9.5 million to participate, but the current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The MLSPA said that the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal to change the arrangement, resulting in an initial 90/10 split of prize money.</p>

Other notable Latino players include Carlos Ruiz, Cuauht√©moc Blanco, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Raul Ruidiaz, Josef Mart√≠nez, and Miguel Almir√≥n, each contributing to the growth and popularity of soccer in the U.S. These players have not only entertained fans but also elevated the league's profile and competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, remains optimistic about technological advancements despite geopolitical tensions and the potential for technological decoupling between the U.S. and China. He emphasized that fundamental sciences like biology, math, physics, and chemistry are universal, allowing breakthroughs in one country to benefit scientists globally. Diamandis expressed concern over cuts to scientific funding in the U.S., particularly at the National Institutes of Health, which he believes could slow the pace of scientific discoveries. Diamandis aims to encourage a positive view of the world, countering the brain's natural inclination towards fear and scarcity.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who received a pardon for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the clemency and is working with her Republican senator to formally decline it. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, stated that the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that she believes those involved were guilty. She views the pardons as part of Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized, a claim she disputes based on her own experience. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other January 6th defendants who sought and celebrated their pardons, highlighting a division within the group.</p>
