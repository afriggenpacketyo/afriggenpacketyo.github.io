          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has publicly addressed and dismissed recent health rumors, assuring fans she is "not dying" and is actively working. Her statement came after her sister, Freida Parton, posted a request for prayers that sparked widespread concern among the public. Parton, 79, explained she had neglected her health following her husband's death but was now addressing minor issues, humorously referencing an AI-generated image of her on her deathbed.</p>

          <p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating the coach needs a three-year timeframe to demonstrate his capabilities. This statement comes amidst a difficult period for the club, which finished 15th last season and has had a poor start to the current one despite significant transfer spending. Ratcliffe dismissed media speculation about Amorim's immediate future, emphasizing that the club will not be run on "knee-jerk reactions" and is focused on long-term profitability and success.</p>

          <p>Nike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, has identified the revitalization of its China operations as a critical component of the company's overall comeback strategy. Hill plans to shift the focus of Nike's 5,000 mono-brand stores in China from sportswear to being more anchored in specific sports, such as running, to create a stronger connection with consumers. The company faces challenges including a recent 9% sales drop in the region and increased costs from U.S.-imposed tariffs, which are projected to be a significant headwind.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the function and benefits of a single-purpose reverse mortgage, a less common financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. Unlike more flexible reverse mortgages, this type is offered by state or local agencies for a specific, pre-approved expense, such as property taxes or essential home repairs. This option typically features lower costs and is aimed at low-to-moderate-income seniors, allowing them to access home equity without incurring monthly payments, though availability and eligibility can be limited.

          <p>This editorial from The Guardian urges UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to attend the upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil, framing his presence as essential for global climate action. The article argues that despite potential domestic political backlash, Starmer must demonstrate leadership and reaffirm the UK's commitment to its climate targets on the world stage. It highlights that current global emissions pledges are insufficient to meet the 1.5C goal, making the summit a critical moment for international cooperation that requires the presence of key world leaders.</p>

          <h2>Entrepreneur Tori Dunlap Explains Her Shift from Renting to Homeownership After Reaching Multimillionaire Status</h2>

          <p>Tori Dunlap, founder of "Her First $100k," recently purchased her first home at age 31 after years of advocating for the financial benefits of renting, which she credits with helping her build her multimillion-dollar business. The decision was prompted by a desire for stability after her landlord decided to sell her rental property, a situation she had faced before. Dunlap opted for a mortgage despite having the cash, putting down 60% to maintain liquidity and strategically use debt as leverage, emphasizing that personal finance should be a tool for life decisions.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has secured a multi-billion dollar deal to supply graphics processing units (GPUs) to OpenAI, marking a significant challenge to Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. This partnership establishes AMD as a viable second major supplier for the massive infrastructure required for advanced AI, a role some analysts compare to its historical position relative to Intel in the PC market. The deal is expected to generate substantial revenue for AMD and signals that its technology is competitive enough for the most demanding large-scale AI deployments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Margaret Spellings, former U.S. Secretary of Education and a key architect of the No Child Left Behind Act, advocates for reinstating high-stakes testing to reverse a decline in student achievement. She argues that the stagnation in test scores began before the COVID-19 pandemic, coinciding with a relaxation of accountability standards in the mid-2010s. Spellings points to states like Mississippi, which have seen success by implementing research-based reading instruction with high fidelity, as evidence that a focus on measurable outcomes and accountability for educators yields positive results.</p>
