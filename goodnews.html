        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, including retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change, effective for new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, aims to alleviate financial burden on affected beneficiaries. Experts note that while this is an improvement, losing half of one's income can still be devastating, potentially leading to homelessness for those relying on benefits to pay for basic needs. The agency had previously increased the rate to 100% after dropping it to 10%, causing considerable fluctuation and uncertainty for beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about criminals impersonating IT help desk personnel to breach organizations after recent cyberattacks on British retailers. The NCSC urges companies to review their IT help desk processes and authentication methods, particularly for senior employees with access to sensitive data. Criminals are using social engineering techniques to trick employees into divulging login credentials. Cyber security experts recommend implementing additional layers of security, such as code words, to verify the authenticity of staff members requesting password resets.</p>
