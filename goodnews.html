          <p>During President Trump's state visit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer successfully avoided major public disagreements, projecting a partnership on defense, trade, and technology. However, the true test of the visit lies in whether Starmer influenced Trump's thinking on key issues like Ukraine and Gaza during their private discussions. Based on their joint press conference, Starmer made little headway on Middle East policy, though there appeared to be some common ground regarding the need to pressure Russia economically.</p>

This new model allows users to see messages and videos, an upgrade from previous audio-only versions, as Meta competes with Google, Snap, and Apple in the emerging smart eyewear market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a typical $50,000 loan, monthly payments are now marginally lower than they were earlier in 2025, with a 15-year loan costing around $487 per month at current average rates. While the savings are not dramatic, they reflect a more favorable borrowing environment for homeowners looking to tap into record-high levels of home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt settlement can offer significant relief by reducing the total amount owed. Negotiating with creditors could potentially lower the principal by 30% to 50%, making repayment more achievable compared to making minimum payments against high interest rates. However, this financial strategy has trade-offs, including a negative impact on credit scores and often requiring a lump-sum payment to settle the reduced balance. (not investment advice)</p>
