          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic has advanced to the second round after a challenging four-set victory over Alexandre Muller. Despite a dominant first set, Djokovic appeared to struggle with a stomach issue early in the third, requiring a medical timeout where he received a tablet from the doctor. He quickly rediscovered his form to secure the win and will now face Britain's Dan Evans, continuing his quest for a record-breaking 25th major title at the tournament.</p>

The ban applies to spaces such as beaches, public parks, forests, and areas surrounding schools, with violators facing fines of up to 700 euros. The French government hopes the measure will "denormalize" smoking and reduce its prevalence, particularly among young people, as the country still has one of the highest smoking rates in Europe despite earlier bans.</p>
