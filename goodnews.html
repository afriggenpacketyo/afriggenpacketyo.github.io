          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil on bail, determining he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE in March, sparking demonstrations. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his residency application, but the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasoning and suggested it was punishing him for his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued his free speech rights were violated, and his wife accepted his diploma on his behalf during his detention. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement. It suggests that the absence of a uniform implies a lack of accountability and makes it difficult to distinguish agents from ordinary citizens or even criminals. The piece sarcastically advises agents to avoid looking like they are acting in an official capacity, recommending outfits that are confusing and non-identifying. The author uses Coco Chanel's quote to emphasize the removal of anything that identifies them as an officer of the law.</p>
