        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock price jump significantly after a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case was perceived favorably by investors. While finding Google's search business to be an illegal monopoly, Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Department of Justice's most severe proposed remedies. The court did not require Google to sell its Chrome browser or impose a contingent divestiture of Android, which were seen as worst-case scenarios for the company. The ruling focuses on limiting certain exclusive distribution contracts and requiring some data sharing, but avoids a structural breakup of the tech giant.</p>

          <p>Amid a rise in parking-related fraud, police and councils are issuing warnings about increasingly sophisticated scams targeting drivers across the UK. Common tactics include fraudulent text messages with malicious links demanding payment for fake fines and physical "skimming" devices attached to parking payment machines to steal card details. This article outlines key methods to protect oneself, such as verifying that genuine fines include vehicle registration, time, and location details. It also advises against clicking unsolicited links and provides tips on how to spot tampered payment machines to avoid falling victim to these schemes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at curbing the flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from China. The legislation targets Chinese officials who fail to take action against trafficking and makes it easier to sanction manufacturers and distributors of fentanyl precursors. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Barr, the bill mandates that these companies implement "know-your-customer" procedures and cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics efforts. While supporters see it as a crucial step to attack the problem at its source, some Democrats noted that sanctions alone are insufficient and stressed the need for effective diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a $24 million assault lawsuit brought by a former security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that a 2018 incident at a Beverly Hills medical building left her with physical and emotional scars after the rapper spat on her and cut her with a fingernail. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, testified that Ellis had been invasive, following her and filming her on a phone. The jury ultimately sided with the rapper, whose legal name is Belcalis Almánzar, finding her not responsible for any damages in the case.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Trump Administration's National Guard Deployment in Los Angeles Was Illegal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a scathing ruling declaring that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles was a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement except under specific circumstances, which the judge found were not met. The opinion by Judge Charles Breyer details how the administration attempted to circumvent the law by creating a "constitutional exception" to justify its actions. This ruling sets a significant legal precedent, scrutinizing the administration's expansive claims of executive power and its potential use of the military in other U.S. cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a market decline where major indexes fell, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain steadfast in their long-term strategies. He attributed the drop to institutional profit-taking, which is common in September, rather than fundamental issues with leading tech companies like Nvidia and Apple. Cramer also noted that investor anxiety is being fueled by a recent court ruling on tariffs and anticipation of the upcoming labor report, which is a key inflation indicator for the Federal Reserve. He urged investors to hold onto their high-quality growth stocks and not to overreact to single-day market movements (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semi-finals after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew due to a knee injury just before their scheduled quarter-final match.

Sabalenka will now face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in a repeat of last year's final. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova 6-3 6-3, marking her second consecutive appearance in the tournament's final four.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has started its verdict deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to unlawfully retain power after his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors allege Bolsonaro and seven others formed an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order, culminating in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings. If convicted, the right-wing populist could face a prison sentence of over 40 years. Presiding Justice Alexandre de Moraes described the plot as an attempt to establish a dictatorship, emphasizing that the court would remain inflexible in defending Brazil's democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot climbing to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of lottery data reveals significant variations in take-home winnings based on state taxes. While the odds of winning remain a steep 1 in 292.2 million, a winner's location can impact their net prize by tens of millions of dollars. States like Florida and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep more of their prize after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new court filing, the lawyer for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook asserts that she "did not ever commit mortgage fraud" and that President Trump's attempt to fire her is a pretext for his desire for lower interest rates. Attorney Abbe Lowell argues that the alleged inconsistencies in Cook's mortgage applications, cited by Trump as cause for her termination, were known to the White House and Senate during her confirmation process in 2022. Because this information was previously vetted, Lowell contends it cannot constitute a legitimate basis for her removal now. The filing aims to secure a temporary block on the firing, framing it as a threat to the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. footprint by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. Initially, the vehicles will operate with human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually gather data before the company validates its technology for fully autonomous service in these new markets. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to launch its driverless ride-hailing service across the country, which is already commercially available in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. The test fleets in the new cities will use a mix of electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr vehicles.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce a new law in England that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban would apply to all retail outlets, including shops, cafes, and online stores, targeting popular brands like Red Bull and Prime. This move addresses growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative health impacts of these drinks on young people, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. While most supermarkets already have a voluntary ban, this legislation would make the restriction mandatory.</p>
