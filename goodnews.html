          <p>The House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant win for Republicans despite opposition from every Democrat and some Republicans.

Speaker Mike Johnson spent two months crafting the bill and two days making last-minute changes. The legislation's passage represents a major victory for Republican leaders, but its future in the Senate remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing starting June 1, citing regular "price adjustments" amid uncertainty over US tariffs. This follows Adidas's warning of similar price hikes due to tariffs targeting goods made in Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its products. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by up to $10, while clothing and equipment will see increases between $2 and $10. The move reflects the challenges companies face in navigating external factors like tariffs and their impact on consumer confidence.</p>

The team successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 18 miles. This experiment ignited and sustained stable detonation waves for over two seconds, which researchers claim proves the concept's technical feasibility for military applications. The ODE concept, initially proposed by US Air Force-contracted researchers in 1958, promises propulsion without moving parts by coupling shock waves with combustion.</p>
