          <p>As Barcelona's football prodigy Lamine Yamal turns 18, he stands at the center of immense attention and speculation, having already played over 100 first-team games. Despite constant comparisons to Lionel Messi, Yamal insists on creating his own legacy, supported by a grounded family life that helps him manage the pressures of fame. His on-pitch maturity and remarkable statistics have led to a contract renewal until 2031 with a reported 1 billion euro buyout clause. While still a work in progress, his combination of immense talent, humility, and on-field freedom positions him as a generational star for both his club and the Spanish national team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the upstream portion of the Brahmaputra River in Tibet may be increasing water flow during the dry season, contrary to fears in downstream India of potential drought. By analyzing data from two existing dams since 2014, researchers found that low-flow levels in February rose by over 50%, with significant increases throughout the dry season. This research provides the first data-driven insight into the effects of these dams, suggesting they might regulate water flow in a way that alleviates dry conditions rather than exacerbating them.</p>
