          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped charges against two British men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The men, one of whom was a former parliamentary researcher, had denied providing information that would be prejudicial to the state. The case, which Beijing had labeled as "malicious slander," was scheduled for trial in October but has now been discontinued. This development concludes a high-profile investigation into alleged foreign interference within the British government.</p>

          <p>Africa's engagement in space technology has significantly evolved from merely hosting infrastructure for foreign missions to developing its own capabilities. Countries are now designing and launching satellites tailored to specific continental needs, such as managing floods, droughts, and improving agricultural yields. The recent inauguration of the African Space Agency (AfSA) in Egypt, with backing from China, aims to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among nations with varying levels of space program maturity. This strategic shift emphasizes using space as a practical tool for economic and social development rather than for extraterrestrial exploration.</p>

          <p>The privately-funded National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta is undergoing a major expansion, adding new galleries and interactive experiences focused on racial justice and democracy. The renovation aims to transform the museum into a dynamic space that encourages visitor action, a mission that contrasts with efforts by the Trump administration to reshape the teaching of American history. The expansion includes new exhibits on the Reconstruction era, a recreation of Martin Luther King Jr.'s home office, and an enhanced sit-in simulation to provide a more immersive understanding of the civil rights struggle.</p>

          <p>Five years after their signing, former Vice President Mike Pence asserts that the Abraham Accords remain a testament to a peace-through-strength foreign policy. He credits the Trump administration's leadership for achieving the historic normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab nations, including the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. Pence argues that the accords have demonstrated resilience, even amid regional conflicts, and have fostered significant economic and social ties. He calls for the current administration to prioritize expanding the circle of peace, particularly by encouraging Saudi Arabia to join the framework.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to receive a second state visit to the U.K., an honor never before extended to a U.S. president, which will include a meeting with King Charles and a state banquet at Windsor Castle. The visit is seen by the British government as a key diplomatic opportunity to leverage Trump's known affinity for the royal family to influence his stance on critical issues like support for Ukraine. Trump's fascination with the monarchy, partly inherited from his mother, has been a consistent theme throughout his public life. The event highlights the U.K.'s use of soft power to navigate its relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. brings renewed focus on the strict protocols of interacting with the British monarchy. Hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, the event will feature a carriage procession, a military parade, and a formal dinner, all governed by intricate rules of etiquette. Past American leaders, including Trump himself, have made headlines for protocol breaches, such as walking ahead of the late Queen Elizabeth II. The visit is being described as a "royal charm offensive" by the British government to strengthen diplomatic ties amid global geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The successful initial public offering of Swedish payments company Klarna has sparked investor interest in which other major financial technology firms might soon go public. Companies like digital payments giant Stripe and online banking unicorns Revolut and Monzo are seen as leading contenders. While some, like Stripe, have recently opted for secondary share sales to provide liquidity for employees, the positive market reception for recent fintech listings is creating a more favorable environment for a new wave of IPOs. The potential listings highlight the growing maturity and scale of the global fintech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is scheduled to visit China for talks with his counterpart, Wang Yi, signaling a potential warming of relations between the two countries. A key topic of discussion will be the possibility of Chinese President Xi Jinping attending the upcoming APEC summit in Seoul, which would be his first visit to South Korea since 2014. The meeting comes as the new South Korean presidential administration seeks to recalibrate its foreign policy, which had previously soured under a predecessor who more closely aligned with Washington.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit, the United States and the United Kingdom are expected to sign a series of significant deals to accelerate the development of nuclear power. The partnership aims to build up to 12 new advanced modular reactors and develop nuclear-powered data centers, generating thousands of jobs and unlocking billions in private investment. The agreement, dubbed the "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy," reinforces both nations' commitment to nuclear energy as a low-carbon solution to meet rising energy demands, particularly those driven by the artificial intelligence industry.</p>

          <p>Recent data from China's central bank indicates a continuing shift of household funds from traditional bank deposits into the country's stock market, suggesting the current equity rally could be sustained. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and fund companies, saw a significant increase for the second consecutive month. Analysts attribute this trend to low interest rates on savings accounts, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital markets. This rotation of capital is providing a strong tailwind for Chinese stocks after a long period of underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is considering a new initiative, known as "Coal-to-Nuclear" (C2N), which would involve repurposing retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced nuclear reactors. Proposed by a top state-owned energy infrastructure company, the plan aims to leverage existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions, to accelerate decarbonization. The project would utilize fourth-generation reactors, which researchers believe could more easily meet safety requirements and gain public acceptance. With a large fleet of coal plants nearing retirement, this strategy offers a potential pathway to transition China's energy grid while preserving valuable assets.</p>
