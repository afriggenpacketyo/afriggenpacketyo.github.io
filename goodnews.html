        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of Ether and associated stocks has increased, driven by a surge of interest in the tokenization of real-world assets and the growing use of stablecoins. Tokenization, the process of creating digital representations of assets on a blockchain, is seen as a major use case for the Ethereum network. This renewed enthusiasm comes as ether-based ETFs see significant inflows and companies like Robinhood expand tokenized trading options. The trend highlights a potential shift in Ethereum's value proposition despite recent market volatility and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French astronaut Sophie Adenot will be dining on gourmet cuisine during her mission to the International Space Station next year, thanks to a collaboration with renowned chef Anne-Sophie Pic. The menu, which includes lobster bisque, foie gras, and braised beef, was specially developed to meet the strict technical constraints of space travel, such as being crumb-free and having a long shelf life. These 'bonus meals' are designed to boost morale and help astronauts feel connected to Earth. The project represents a unique fusion of haute cuisine and space exploration, bringing French gastronomy to an extraterrestrial setting.</p>

          <p>India established a solid position at the close of day one in the second Test against England, reaching 310-5, largely thanks to a patient century from captain Shubman Gill. Despite an admirable effort from England's bowlers on a flat pitch at Edgbaston, India managed to build crucial partnerships throughout the day. England's captain Ben Stokes chose to bowl first, and while his team secured key wickets, Gill's unflustered performance, supported by Ravindra Jadeja, ensured the tourists ended the day with a slight advantage. The day's play sets up a competitive continuation of the Test match.</p>

          <p>New research from Tufts University indicates that consuming coffee with minimal or no sugar and cream could be associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The study, which highlights the potential health benefits of how coffee is prepared, found that black coffee drinkers had a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared to individuals who do not drink coffee. These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that coffee, particularly when consumed without high-calorie additives, can be part of a healthy lifestyle. The research underscores the importance of considering preparation methods in nutrition studies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is directly engaging with House Republicans, hosting multiple meetings at the White House to ramp up pressure on them to pass his signature tax and spending bill. With the legislation facing potential defeat due to internal GOP divisions, Trump is acting as the 'best closer' for his party's leadership, personally speaking with lawmakers who remain undecided. This hands-on approach, which includes a public pressure campaign on social media, underscores the high stakes for the administration. The goal is to unify the party and push the bill, which already passed the Senate by a narrow margin, across the finish line in the House.</p>

In a television appearance, Parchman shared the shock of his diagnosis and the feeling of being the 'weakest link' during his and his wife's two-and-a-half-year IVF journey. He wrote the book to provide a much-needed resource for men, who are often sidelined and lack support during fertility treatments. Parchman advocates for more open communication and vulnerability among men facing infertility, which accounts for at least 30% of all cases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae can devastate livestock, wildlife, and even kill pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas to mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch. This sterile insect technique successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago but is being revived due to the fly's recent reappearance in southern Mexico. A new, larger breeding facility is expected to be operational by 2026.</p>

Pilots are trained from their earliest days to manage communication loss, utilizing backup radio frequencies, an emergency channel, and even a text-based messaging system. All airliners are also equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that independently scans for other aircraft and issues commands to climb or descend to maintain separation. While outages can cause significant delays, these robust backup procedures are designed to ensure passenger safety is not compromised.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on many of the country's exports to the United States. This rate is significantly lower than the 46% levy that was previously threatened and set to take effect next week. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants U.S. exports, including large-engine vehicles, tariff-free access to the Vietnamese market. The agreement also includes a 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam from third countries. This follows a pattern of the Trump administration negotiating bilateral deals to adjust its global tariff policies.</p>
