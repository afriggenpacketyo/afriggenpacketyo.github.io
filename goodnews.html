          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump met with House Republican holdouts on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to salvage the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." The GOP is struggling to unify around the bill, facing sticking points over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deduction caps. Johnson remains optimistic about passing the bill this week, but hard-liners are pledging to vote against it, citing concerns about the national deficit. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a letter urging passage, calling failure to do so "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

          <p>Health insurer Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached a new deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to cap copays on popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

Employee out-of-pocket costs will be capped at $200 per month, less than half the cash price without insurance. The deal also includes a simplified pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and Evernorth's home delivery service.</p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief is a debt settlement company that negotiates with creditors to reduce debt amounts in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free debt evaluation, setting up a dedicated account, negotiation, and approval and payment. To qualify, individuals typically need at least $7,500 in unsecured debt and demonstrable financial hardship. While it can substantially reduce debt, it can also severely damage credit scores and involves fees ranging from 15% to 25% of the total debt enrolled. (not investment advice)</p>

The Green Bay Packers had submitted a revised proposal citing player safety and pace of play, but the NFL stated no injuries have been reported on the play.
