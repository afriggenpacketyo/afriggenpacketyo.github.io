        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health insurer Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit Evernorth has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower prices for employers and workers on GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. The deal aims to make the drugs more accessible by capping employee out-of-pocket costs at $200 per month for clients not currently covering the medications. The new deal will also include a simplified pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and home delivery services. Clients already offering the weight loss drugs are expected to see up to a 20% reduction in costs with the updated arrangement.</p>

          <p>Despite inflation concerns, there are ways to save money on summer vacations. Flight and hotel costs are down compared to last year, offering opportunities for deals. However, ride-share fares and entertainment costs have increased.

Kangaroos are legal to own in Colorado, but escapes are often linked to the animal not having enough space to bounce in.</p>
