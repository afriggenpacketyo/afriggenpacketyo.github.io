          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, in exchange for reciprocal treatment. This move signals a potential shift from India's protectionist trade policies, influenced by recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian exports. While some experts believe the deal may not significantly harm domestic industries, others emphasize the importance of careful consideration to protect local businesses. A trade deal could benefit sectors like financials, materials, healthcare, and logistics in India, while the absence of a deal could negatively impact their earnings.</p>

          <p>Albania is preparing for parliamentary elections, seen as a critical test of the country's democratic maturity and its EU integration prospects. Prime Minister Edi Rama and the Socialist Party are seeking a fourth consecutive term, while the opposition remains fragmented. The election's outcome will significantly influence Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and upholding the rule of law, crucial for its EU accession. New parties are emerging, potentially shaking up the political landscape dominated by the SP and DP, offering voters alternative options. However, concerns persist regarding the fairness of the electoral process and the inclusion of candidates under investigation for corruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by a jump in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, compensating for a sharp decline in outbound goods to the U.S. due to high tariffs. Exports increased by 8.1% year-on-year, while imports decreased by 0.2%. Shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, while exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations surged by 20.8%. This surge in exports could be partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, suggesting a potential weakening of trade data in the coming months.</p>

The author notes that the Trump administration is stressing unilateralism in Greenland more than NATO cooperation, which may not sit well with Denmark and other Scandinavian Arctic states. The article proposes applying the "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, to Greenland to avoid sovereignty conflicts and reinforce international stability.</p>

An indefinite halt to construction on a wind farm off Long Island has shocked industry executives and contractors. While the industry is counting on Europe to make up for a pullback in the United States, Orsted, a Denmark-based global wind developer, said it would not proceed with a large planned wind facility in Britain's North Sea.
