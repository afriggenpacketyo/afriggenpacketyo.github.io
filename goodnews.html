          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo have launched their initial television advertisements, using the ongoing federal government shutdown to frame their campaigns. Mamdani's ad focuses on affordability and blames the Trump administration for the shutdown, aligning with progressive figures. Conversely, Cuomo's ad highlights his experience and criticizes the administration for cutting counterterrorism and infrastructure funding to the region. The dueling messages showcase their distinct priorities and political strategies as they seek to appeal to voters just a month before the election.</p>

          <p>Carlos Cruz, who immigrated to the United States from El Salvador in 1979 to escape the impending civil war, has become a successful restaurateur in Baltimore. Starting his career as a dishwasher, Cruz eventually opened three popular establishments: Carlos O'Charlies, Bayside Cantina, and Chilango's. His culinary success has also led him to cater for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team for many years. Cruz attributes his achievements to the support of his family and the core values of respect and honesty instilled by his parents during his upbringing in a small Salvadoran village.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, announced a new pricing model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, a move that sent its stock soaring over 20%. This change could potentially disintermediate the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—which have traditionally served as middlemen and whose stocks fell sharply on the news. The new plan offers lenders a choice of pricing models, which Fair Isaac says will eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and give more control to those making mortgage decisions, a development praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director.</p>

Speaking on "CBS Mornings," she hinted that the door might not be fully closed on the characters. Parker also shifted focus to her passion for publishing through her book imprint, SJP Lit, which champions novels with significant emotional depth. She highlighted her latest selection, "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 17th-century Amsterdam, praising its skillful blend of fact and fiction.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Reports 7% Rise in Quarterly Deliveries as Key US Tax Credit Expires</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:16:57 EDT</div>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units, which slightly exceeded analyst expectations. However, the company's vehicle production for the quarter saw a decline compared to the previous year, and its stock price fell following the report. The delivery figures were released as a significant federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired, which may have spurred some sales at the end of the quarter. The results reflect a mixed performance, with a sales slump in Europe being partially offset by stronger demand in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Considers Replacing Profit and Sustainability Rules</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League is considering a shift away from its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), with a decision on an alternative system expected in the coming months. Chief Executive Richard Masters stated that the league is in discussions with clubs about adopting a squad cost ratio (SCR) model, which is more closely aligned with UEFA's financial regulations. The current PSR, which limits club losses to £105 million over three years, has been criticized for stifling investment. The proposed SCR system would allow clubs to spend a set percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs, aiming to maintain competitive balance while allowing for strategic growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that continues to intrigue observers and even the Finns themselves. The World Happiness Report measures life satisfaction, and experts suggest Finland's success stems from a strong sense of societal contentment rather than daily expressions of joy. This contentment is fostered by a robust social safety net, funded by high taxes, which provides free access to public resources like extensive libraries and ensures universal opportunities. Additionally, a deep cultural connection to nature and traditions like sauna use contribute significantly to the nation's overall well-being.</p>

          <p>This article explores the strong connection between physical exercise and happiness, citing scientific evidence that different types of workouts can effectively manage mood and stress. Aerobic activities like running are particularly effective at stimulating mood-balancing neurochemicals, while strength training can boost confidence and yoga is beneficial for stress management. The greatest well-being benefits are often seen in sedentary individuals who begin a new routine, with studies showing significant reductions in depressive symptoms after just a few months. The key to success is establishing a consistent habit, with researchers suggesting four workouts a week for about six weeks to solidify a new regimen.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver and current Formula 1 championship leader Oscar Piastri stated that he learned valuable "lessons on risk" from his challenging race weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Piastri crashed multiple times and was forced to retire on the first lap of the race, allowing his competitors to close the gap in the points standings. Looking ahead to the Singapore Grand Prix, he acknowledged that his team cannot afford similar performances and emphasized the importance of staying focused on the successful strategies that have defined most of his season. He attributed the poor result to correctable mistakes rather than a need for a revolutionary change in his approach.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object was identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro, an island 400 miles from Earhart's intended destination, and has been visible in photos since 1938. This theory suggests Earhart landed on the island after running out of fuel in 1937 and was marooned. The team will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object, hoping to find definitive proof and potentially return the historic plane to the university.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of conspiracy theories surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, which have persisted for over eight decades and were recently reignited by President Trump's order to declassify related government records. The author argues that tales of espionage and capture by the Japanese were largely fabrications, some even promoted for profit by Earhart's own widower. The historical consensus among aviation experts remains that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. The piece urges remembering Earhart for her actual achievements as a pioneering aviator rather than the myths surrounding her tragic, yet likely mundane, death.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile. Berkshire is already a major shareholder in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses a common misconception among investors known as "low-price bias," the belief that a stock with a lower share price has more upside potential than one with a higher price. It explains that this view is misguided because a stock's nominal price does not reflect its underlying value, growth prospects, or overall market capitalization. Using a comparison between Nvidia and International Paper, the article demonstrates how focusing on fundamentals like revenue growth and industry trends is a far more effective investment strategy than being influenced by the arbitrary share price. The piece emphasizes that true investing is about assessing a company's value, not just its price tag.</p>
