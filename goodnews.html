          <p>A 41-year-old New Jersey man was arrested outside Saint Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington, D.C., for possessing a Molotov cocktail and other suspicious items. The arrest occurred early Sunday morning before the cathedral was scheduled to host its annual Red Mass, an event for judges, lawyers, and public officials. Metropolitan Police Department officers, who were on detail for the event, identified the man in a tent on the cathedral steps, from which he had been previously barred. The suspect was taken into custody without incident, and an explosive disposal team secured the scene, confirming no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The Wigan Warriors women's rugby team completed a historic treble by defeating St Helens 16-12 in the Women's Super League Grand Final. In front of a record crowd of 5,018, Wigan overcame a halftime deficit to secure their first Grand Final title since 2018, adding it to their Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield trophies. After an early lead by Wigan, St Helens scored twice to lead at the break. However, a strong second-half performance, highlighted by two tries from Molly Jones, allowed the Warriors to reclaim the lead and hold on for the championship victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts," as recent protests in the city were not significantly violent or disruptive. The state of Oregon had filed a lawsuit arguing the president lacked the authority to federalize the Guard for domestic law enforcement in this context. Oregon's Attorney General praised the decision as a necessary check on executive power, while the White House indicated it would likely appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish scored a dramatic 93rd-minute winner for Everton against Crystal Palace, continuing his impressive form and strengthening his case for an England national team call-up. Despite being left out of the latest squad, the 30-year-old has been pivotal for Everton, providing four assists and now a crucial goal in his first six Premier League appearances. Grealish stated his focus remains on his club performance but acknowledged his desire to play for his country. Former England striker Wayne Rooney commented that Grealish's consistent high-level play is undoubtedly giving England manager Thomas Tuchel a selection "headache" ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>During his hosting debut on Saturday Night Live, musical artist Bad Bunny addressed the controversy surrounding his selection as the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer. He humorously referenced threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who warned that immigration agents would be present and that only Americans should attend. In his monologue, the Puerto Rican-born U.S. citizen spoke in Spanish about the performance being an accomplishment for all Latinos, demonstrating their indelible contribution to the country. He then quipped in English that those who didn't understand have four months to learn the language before the event.</p>

          <h2>Climate Expert Clarifies Distinction Between Short-Term Weather and Long-Term Climate Change</h2>

          <p>An expert from the Australian Associated Press has addressed the common misconception that cold weather disproves global warming, explaining the fundamental difference between weather and climate. In a widely shared video, Susie Dodds clarifies that weather refers to daily atmospheric conditions, while climate describes long-term patterns over decades. She notes that while one region experiences a cold snap, others may face record heatwaves, which is consistent with scientific warnings about more extreme and chaotic weather patterns. This planetary imbalance is driven by human activity, which has caused a measurable increase in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, Wall Street is monitoring its potential economic impact, though the stock market has so far remained resilient, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high. Investors are also focused on an upcoming investor day for Solstice Advanced Materials, which is set to be spun off from Honeywell, providing details on its future growth prospects. Additionally, a light week for corporate earnings will still offer valuable insights into the economy, with reports expected from companies like Constellation Brands, PepsiCo, and Delta Air Lines. This corporate commentary is especially crucial as the flow of official government economic data has been halted. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Dr. Mark Travers, the number one cause of fights among couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations about these topics. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. Dr. Travers advises individuals to become self-aware and apologize for harsh tones, rephrasing their statements to de-escalate potential arguments. He also suggests that the person on the receiving end should calmly request their partner to try again, thereby interrupting a negative cycle before it begins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily concentrated in England's Women's Super League and the U.S. National Women's Soccer League. While experts see this as a positive sign for the sport's ecosystem, there are growing concerns that the escalating fees could widen the gap between the wealthiest leagues and the rest of the world. For example, Germany's Bundesliga is struggling to compete financially, with its broadcasting and sponsorship deals trailing far behind those in England and the U.S. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier of clubs that smaller leagues cannot challenge.</p>

          <p>A successful vaccination program against the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States has significantly reduced infections, suggesting that herd immunity against the primary cause of cervical cancer is attainable. A new study found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates led to a substantial decline in cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women, who saw a 75% drop in infections. This indirect protection highlights the community-wide benefit of the vaccine, which is typically administered to adolescents. However, experts caution that maintaining this protection depends on sustaining high vaccination rates amid challenges like global vaccine skepticism and misinformation.</p>

          <p>A series of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino County overnight from Saturday to Sunday. The cluster of temblors was centered in the San Bernardino Mountains and produced weak shaking that was noticeable to residents but unlikely to cause damage. The area's last significant seismic activity was in 1992 when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused substantial damage. The recent quakes serve as a reminder of the region's geological activity, though they were minor in comparison to historical events like the 1992 Landers and Big Bear earthquakes.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell claimed victory at the Singapore Grand Prix, while the McLaren team clinched the constructors' championship for the season. However, McLaren's celebration was overshadowed by rising tension between its drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, after they made contact at the start of the race. Piastri argued it was unfair that the team did not ask them to swap positions back following the incident. Russell led a controlled race from the front, finishing ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who successfully defended his second-place position from a persistent late-race attack by Norris.</p>
