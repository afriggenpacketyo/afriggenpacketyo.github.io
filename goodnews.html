          <p>This article explores whether gold is a suitable investment for beginners in the current economic climate. It advises new investors to consider their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth preserver than an income generator. The piece also highlights the metal's price volatility and the importance of viewing it as a tool for portfolio diversification, especially as a hedge against inflation. Prospective investors are encouraged to weigh these factors to determine if and how gold fits into their overall strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to overhaul its electric vehicle production, with the goal of creating more affordable models for consumers. The investment includes modernizing its Louisville Assembly Plant and building a new battery facility in Michigan. The company introduced a new 'universal EV platform' and a tree-like assembly process, which it claims will significantly speed up manufacturing and reduce the number of parts. The first vehicle from this new system, a midsize truck starting at $30,000, is scheduled to debut in 2027.</p>

          <p>A social media post from the 'New Heights' podcast, hosted by Travis and Jason Kelce, has ignited widespread speculation among Taylor Swift's fans that she will be the upcoming 'VERY special guest.' The announcement graphic featured several clues that Swifties interpreted as 'Easter eggs,' including a silhouette resembling the pop star and the use of colors associated with her Eras tour. While unconfirmed, the possibility has generated significant excitement, as Swift has been dating Travis Kelce for two years but has never appeared on the popular podcast.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will end its dial-up internet service on September 30, marking the conclusion of a technology that defined the early internet for millions. The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated the decision was part of a routine evaluation of its services to meet the needs of the modern digital landscape. While few households still use the service, the iconic screeching sound of the dial-up modem and the 'You've Got Mail' greeting are remembered as key cultural touchstones of the 1990s. The change will not affect free AOL email accounts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly signed an executive order to pause additional tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, pushing a deadline that was set to expire. This move avoids an immediate escalation in the trade conflict as negotiations between the U.S. and China continue. The extension keeps current tariff rates in place and averts a snap-back to much higher levels. The decision comes after several rounds of talks between the two nations and could increase the likelihood of a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and President Xi later this year.</p>

          <p>German sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology after facing accusations of cultural appropriation over its 'Oaxaca Slip-On' shoe. The design was inspired by traditional 'huarache' sandals from the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the product's creation. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and other officials condemned the shoe as an inappropriate use of cultural heritage. In its apology, Adidas reaffirmed its commitment to respectful dialogue and honoring the community's craft heritage, a sentiment echoed by the shoe's designer.</p>

          <h2>Analyzing the Implications of the U.S. Government's 15% Revenue Share Deal with Nvidia and AMD</h2>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal, confirmed by the White House, allows the companies to resume selling specific chips like Nvidia's H20 to the large Chinese market, which had been restricted by export controls. Analysts view the move as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, and investors see it as a net positive for the companies, as receiving 85% of revenue is better than being shut out of the market entirely.</p>
