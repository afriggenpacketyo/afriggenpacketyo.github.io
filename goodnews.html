          <h2>Body Fat Percentage a More Accurate Predictor of Mortality Risk Than BMI, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body mass index (BMI) is a flawed and unreliable predictor of mortality risk compared to body fat percentage. Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period and had a significantly higher risk of death from heart disease. The study advocates for using more accurate methods like bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in clinical settings, as BMI fails to distinguish between muscle and fat, potentially misclassifying health risks for many individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine is intensifying its use of specialized interceptor drones as a countermeasure against a surge in Russian Shahed drone attacks on its cities. These domestically produced drones are faster and more maneuverable than standard models, making them effective at downing the high-altitude Russian drones that evade ground-based defenses. This strategic shift is seen as a more cost-effective solution than using expensive anti-aircraft missiles, with Ukraine ramping up production and training new pilot units to protect its infrastructure and defense systems.</p>

Furthermore, these platforms operate within a relatively mature regulatory framework, providing China with a foundational advantage over nations building such systems from scratch.
