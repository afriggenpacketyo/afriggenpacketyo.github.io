          <p>Huawei Technologies is seeking to strengthen its position as a key global supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G infrastructure for network operators, even as the telecoms industry experiences market saturation. Huawei deputy chairman Eric Xu Zhijun outlined four key growth areas: new user groups, high-definition video, intelligent connected vehicles, and expanded fiber-to-the-room for small businesses. Xu did not address the geopolitical challenges Huawei has faced since the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2019, which have hindered its overseas expansion. Despite these challenges, Huawei is committed to working with global carriers to achieve sustainable growth in the evolving telecoms landscape.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has turned reporting idling vehicles into a six-figure income by leveraging the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. The program allows citizens to report trucks and non-city buses idling for over three minutes, entitling them to 25% of the resulting fines. George Pakenham, who helped create the law, emphasizes it as a public health measure to reduce air pollution. While the program has generated significant revenue for the city, some truck drivers view it as a "bounty hunter program" and argue that idling is sometimes necessary for their operations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are undergoing an ownership change, with Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and his TWG Global group set to acquire majority ownership of the franchise at a $10 billion valuation. This move is seen as a positive development for the Lakers, as Walter's group has a proven track record of success with the Dodgers, including multiple playoff appearances and World Series wins. While the Buss family, who have owned the Lakers since 1979, will retain a minority stake, the change in leadership is expected to bring a renewed focus on sustained championship contention and a significant investment in the team's infrastructure and resources.</p>

These chicks will eventually be released into the wild to increase the genetic diversity of the condor population. The zoo's double-brooding method, where two chicks are raised simultaneously by surrogate condors, has contributed to the program's success. The California Condor Recovery Program has brought the condor population from just 22 individuals four decades ago to over 560 today, though the species still faces threats from lead poisoning and other toxins.</p>

This comes as the OfS publishes guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech under a new law. The guidance aims to provide clarity to universities on how to balance freedom of speech with the need to protect students from harassment and unlawful discrimination. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with the OfS having the power to impose sanctions for failures.</p>
