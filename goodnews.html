          <p>The Powerball jackpot, which had grown to an estimated $1.8 billion, has been won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers drawn were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. This jackpot stands as the second-largest in the game's history, with a cash value option of approximately $826.4 million. The massive prize had steadily climbed after dozens of consecutive drawings failed to produce a winner.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in such a status. The article explains the critical differences between the two, noting that interest may not accrue on certain loans during a deferment, making it a more favorable option. While these tools are vital for preventing default, experts caution that they are not long-term solutions and can lead to higher overall debt compared to income-driven repayment plans.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, often called the "silent killer," increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia, affecting over half of Americans by age 40. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, advising lifestyle changes and potential medication once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Experts stress that proactively managing hypertension can add years of healthy life, and for those with blood pressure over 140/90, treatment should begin with two medications for greater effectiveness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 06:06:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices continue to hit record highs, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts, investors are increasingly drawn to the precious metal. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way to gain exposure is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). While gold is considered a safe-haven asset, advisors generally recommend that it should constitute a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio.

          <p>A district judge in Utah has struck down the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-led legislature engaged in unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. The decision is a significant victory for voting rights advocates and aligns with the will of Utah voters, who had approved an independent redistricting commission in 2018 only to have it overridden by lawmakers. The invalidated map had notably split Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four separate districts, and the court has ordered a new, fairer map to be drawn.</p>

          <p>While England's Premier League consistently outspends its European rivals, Spain's La Liga has prioritized financial sustainability through a strict economic control framework implemented in 2013. This move successfully stabilized clubs that were previously facing bankruptcy and debt. Despite having less financial firepower for transfers, Spanish clubs continue to excel in European competitions, demonstrating that a model based on fiscal discipline and strong youth academies can still deliver elite-level success on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK have an opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a reddish tint, creating a spectacular "Blood Moon." The full eclipse will occur in the evening, with the best viewing available in eastern parts of the country shortly after moonrise. Astronomers explain the phenomenon is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, and advise finding a location with a clear view of the eastern horizon to enjoy the celestial event.</p>

Former FBI agents involved in the original case recall their frustration over what they describe as missed opportunities to arrest him before he vanished.</p>
