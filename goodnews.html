          <h2>Weight Loss Jabs to Be Available at UK Chemists Amidst Debate on NHS Impact</h2>

          <p>UK health officials are reportedly planning a trial to make weight-loss injections like Ozempic available over-the-counter at chemists, potentially costing the NHS ¬£9.90 per prescription. This initiative aims to widen access to these treatments, with approximately one in ten overweight individuals being eligible through the NHS. While proponents argue it will expedite access, critics warn about the potential strain on the NHS budget and the long-term implications of widespread use. The program is being called 'Britain's war on obesity' by some, while other sources worry about the financial impact of the new program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene left debris in East Tennessee waterways. The study aims to determine the impact of the debris on sport fish, comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. The tourism department notes that sport fishing contributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to the area annually, and most fishing tournaments were rescheduled due to the hurricane's aftermath. Cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are about 90% complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>
