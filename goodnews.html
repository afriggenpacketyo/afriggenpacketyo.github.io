          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost 11 years prior by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan. Chad Volk of LC Car Care found the wallet lodged under the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge he was repairing. After finding the owner's employee ID, Volk used Facebook to contact retired autoworker Richard Guilford and mailed the wallet back to him. Guilford was reunited with his lost cash, expired lottery tickets, and surprisingly still-valid gift cards.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier concept featuring an innovative single, rotating "scissor wing" design, potentially realizing an idea once explored by NASA. This design allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage at low speeds for maximum lift and then pivot to become parallel at hypersonic speeds up to Mach 5. This adaptability helps mitigate shock waves and wave drag during transonic flight. In its hypersonic configuration, the entire aircraft functions as a "waverider," generating high pressure for sustained high-speed travel.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been renovated into a luxury party and event space and is now on the market for £3 million. Mike Conner, a former software CEO, purchased the abandoned island fort in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project to make it habitable. The historic building, originally built in the 1850s to defend against French attacks, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. The complex renovation required bringing all materials, including a biodigester, to the remote island location.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative cooking to feed their children affordably during the six-week summer holidays. Strategies include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to use food before it expires. Some parents also pre-portion daily snacks into separate bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. For many families, local food pantries and council-issued food vouchers have become essential resources to cope with the increased financial pressure.</p>

          <p>The historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has introduced a new five-story vertical mausoleum to address the growing demand for burial space in Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum provides permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people, towering over the final resting places of Hollywood legends. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of the city, aiming to create a peaceful environment for visitors. The cemetery has evolved into a cultural hub, hosting movie nights and festivals, and this vertical expansion represents an innovative solution to urban space constraints.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, at the start of their secondary school education during a COVID-19 lockdown.

As 11-year-olds, they wondered if face masks would still be needed and whether they would achieve their dreams.

          <p>Rising British heavyweight Moses Itauma defeated veteran Dillian Whyte with a stunning first-round stoppage, taking less than two minutes to secure the victory.

          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," documents the final burst of studio creativity from Elvis Presley between 1972 and 1975, 48 years after his death. The set includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage to Priscilla Presley was ending. The period is framed by a significant missed opportunity: a potential role opposite Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," which some friends believe could have revitalized his career. The recordings showcase his expressive vocal talent in middle age and his strong rapport with his TCB live band.</p>
