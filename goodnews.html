          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly committed to remaining at the helm of the electric vehicle company for the next five years, addressing concerns from investors about his dedication given his advisory role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk emphasized that his desire to maintain control over Tesla's future is the primary reason for staying on, rather than financial gain. He seeks to retain sufficient voting power to prevent being ousted by activist investors, ensuring he can guide the company's direction and long-term strategy. Musk's announcement led to a slight increase in Tesla's stock price.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As senior homeowners face financial pressures, experts are advising them to consider options like HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) and reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity. HELOCs offer flexible financing with lower interest rates compared to credit cards, making them suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation. Reverse mortgages, available to seniors 62 and up, allow homeowners to convert equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. However, reverse mortgages accrue interest and fees, reducing home equity over time, and are best suited as long-term solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and they have diversified import sources to reduce reliance on any single country. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which anticipates raising prices due to tariffs, and comes as Home Depot experiences stagnating sales in a sluggish housing market. McPhail believes maintaining stable prices could help Home Depot gain market share.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that would allow asset managers to offer an ETF share class of an existing mutual fund, potentially blurring the lines between the two investment vehicles. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, aiming to provide investors with more choice, but concerns remain about potential tax risks. The key difference between ETFs and mutual funds lies in their tax treatment, with ETFs structured to avoid capital gains tax for remaining shareholders when others withdraw funds.
