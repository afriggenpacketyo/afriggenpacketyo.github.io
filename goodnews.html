          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with traditional beer sales falling to their lowest level in over 30 years while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. According to the federal statistics office, beer sales dropped by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, reflecting a growing trend among younger Germans who are more health-conscious. Breweries are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options at sporting events as natural alternatives to energy drinks, though traditional beer remains a cultural staple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after the acrimonious split between creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the iconic Metal Gear Solid series is returning with a remake of its third installment. The original series was lauded for its cinematic storytelling and pioneering gameplay, but the franchise has been dormant since Kojima's departure in 2015, which was reportedly due to spiraling development costs. The remake, titled "Metal Gear Solid Delta," capitalizes on the lucrative trend of modernizing classic games and has been praised by fans for its faithful recreation of the original's story and atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," which combines elements of survival and romance by pairing couples who are then isolated on a remote tropical island. Hosted by Davina McCall, the show tests whether love can blossom under harsh conditions, stripping away the superficial aspects of modern dating. Contestants, who are generally older than those on similar shows like "Love Island," praised the format's authenticity and its focus on building a genuine connection through shared adversity rather than pursuing influencer status.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are using an innovative combination of technology and nature to fight the invasive spruce bark beetle, which poses a multi-billion pound threat to the nation's forests. After discovering that the beetles were being carried by wind from continental Europe, where they have destroyed millions of trees, authorities deployed drones for aerial surveillance, sniffer dogs to detect beetle pheromones, and AI-powered cameras on traps. This comprehensive strategy has successfully eradicated the pest from controlled at-risk areas in England, though climate change could increase future threats.</p>

In the women's draw, Australia's Daria Kasatkina was knocked out by two-time champion Naomi Osaka in a three-set match, leaving de Minaur as the sole Australian remaining in the singles competition.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst, first elected in 2014, will not run for a third term in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, winning her second term in 2020 by a comfortable margin. Her decision is expected to set off a competitive race for the open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy for the Republican nomination.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global instability. As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could champion a form of "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation. This model, leveraging the growing influence of middle powers, could serve as a potential road map for reforming a dysfunctional international system currently paralyzed by competing national interests.</p>

          <p>Starting September 1, Costco will end its grace period and strictly enforce its new rule granting exclusive early-morning shopping access to Executive Members. This policy allows members of the premium $130 tier to shop from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays, a perk designed to reward the company's most loyal customers. The move has been met with some controversy among shoppers with the standard Gold Star membership, who will now be denied entry before the regular opening hours, further differentiating the warehouse club's membership tiers.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a lifelong dream for the acclaimed filmmaker. The ambitious Netflix project stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, offering a large-scale, visually rich take on Mary Shelley's classic novel. Del Toro, known for his empathetic portrayal of monsters, explained that he aimed to present the creature as a beautiful, newborn being rather than a grotesque accident, exploring themes of what it means to be human in a complex world.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea that remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could offer a foundation for improving today's strained bilateral ties. It highlights the forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the American airmen who were protected by Chinese villagers after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, the piece suggests that focusing on this historical alliance against a common enemy could provide a positive narrative to help bridge current diplomatic divides from the ground up.</p>

          <p>A proposal to silence the 150-year-old town clock in Machynlleth, Wales, during overnight hours has been rejected by the town council. The request came from the owner of a nearby hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character and decided against the change. The hotel owner expressed disappointment with the decision and is considering gathering more opinions from local businesses and residents for a future proposal.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," explores the theme that superstardom has not improved her romantic life, as she continues to attract disappointing men. Following the massive success of her previous album, this new work uses a blend of 70s-inspired pop, disco, and country to humorously critique a gallery of inadequate partners. The album's controversial cover art and witty, sometimes provocative lyrics continue Carpenter's project of lampooning social norms and highlighting the frustrations of modern dating, even from a position of fame and success.</p>
