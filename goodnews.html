          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify House Republicans on a megabill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, including Medicaid and tax reform. A key sticking point is the SALT cap, with moderates opposing the proposed $30,000 limit on state and local tax deductions. Johnson aims to find an equilibrium that satisfies everyone and pass the bill by Memorial Day. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a 1,116-page mega bill that the House Budget Committee will send to the Rules committee, putting it on target for a final vote in the House next week. Johnson maintains the package will be deficit-neutral, requiring savings to offset any increases in SALT deductions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:23:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores credit card debt forgiveness as a potential solution for unmanageable debt, explaining that it involves negotiating with creditors to settle the outstanding balance for a lump-sum payment that is less than what is owed. The article clarifies that there are no government-sponsored programs for eliminating credit card debt, but debt settlement programs and bankruptcy are two possible avenues for debt forgiveness. The article also mentions that debt settlement companies do not make payments to your creditors as you save for your settlement, which will likely hurt your credit score and impact the ability to borrow for some time. Thoroughly understanding these prerequisites and potential consequences is vital for determining whether pursuing debt forgiveness makes sense for your specific financial circumstances and objectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Belgian parliament voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a 2003 law that aimed to close nuclear power plants by 2025. The decision comes after a 2022 delay due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, with plans to keep one reactor in each of its two plants as a backup. The conservative-led coalition government supports the move, while previous governments with environmentalist parties opposed it. Nuclear energy currently accounts for about 40% of Belgium's power generation, and other European countries are also considering shifts in nuclear policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data suggests that Republican proposals to cut green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act could lead to increased utility bills and job losses for Americans. The rollback would increase the price of electricity and gas, leading to an "economic slowdown," according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association (Ceba). New Jersey is expected to see the biggest economic losses, with households potentially losing an average of $1,040 in annual income. The research assumes incremental growth in electricity demand due to the growth of data centers.</p>

          <p>This article discusses three insurance policies that seniors should consider this spring: Medicare supplemental insurance, long-term care insurance, and whole life insurance. Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs that regular Medicare doesn't, while long-term care insurance can cover the costs associated with nursing homes and in-home caretakers. Whole life insurance provides a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and leaves beneficiaries with money after death. The article emphasizes that these policies are generally more robust in terms of coverage and less expensive the sooner you apply.</p>
