          <p>Residents in a Richmond, California neighborhood are concerned about a series of unexplained bird deaths, with some suspecting electrocution from power lines. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife evaluated two dead birds and found no evidence of electrocution, but signs of trauma potentially caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. PG&E stated that their equipment is avian-safe and that the birds were not electrocuted. Fish and Wildlife officials are continuing to investigate the cause of the bird deaths, while residents remain concerned about the situation.</p>

          <p>The UK government will allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, a reversal of a previous ban prompted by concerns over foreign influence. The change aims to protect media plurality while helping publishers secure vital funding. Ministers set the threshold for State Owned Investors at 15% of shares or voting rights, deeming it the most effective and proportionate approach. The decision follows a consultation in which many newspaper groups argued that a complete ban was too restrictive for securing financing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has voiced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas, emphasizing the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised state budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and Senator Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills that would simplify the permitting process for infill projects. The proposal seeks to force permit deadlines on the Coastal Commission and create a fund to finance affordable housing near public transit.</p>

The initiative aims to boost foot traffic and support local businesses that have suffered since the pandemic.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking the strongest sign yet of progress in combating the opioid crisis. Data from the CDC reveals a decrease in fatalities across major drug categories and in most states, prompting praise for President Trump's efforts. However, this progress is threatened by proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing substance abuse. Experts fear that these cuts could reverse the positive trend, particularly as drug fatalities remain high despite the recent improvements.</p>

The White House claims the aviation agreement will support 154,000 American jobs, though the calculation method remains unclear.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause on the enrollment of new low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. Those already enrolled will not be removed from their plans, and the changes will not impact children. Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium.</p>

          <p>The resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez has brought the culture and politics of the 1990s back into focus, influencing legal strategies and public perception of the case. Their lawyer, Mark J. Geragos, argued that the punitive criminal justice policies of the 1990s no longer align with contemporary views on rehabilitation. The media's portrayal of the brothers as privileged and unsympathetic also played a role in their initial convictions. New evidence and increased awareness of sexual assault have contributed to a shift in public sentiment, potentially paving the way for their release.</p>
