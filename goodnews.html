          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with several quantum-computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti Computing, about the government taking equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This strategy aligns with recent moves to secure national interests in critical industries, following similar investments in rare earth company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. Proponents argue the government should benefit from the success of companies it supports, reflecting a strategic focus on technological competition with China and safeguarding national security. The news caused a surge in the stock prices of the mentioned quantum firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese leaders have concluded their "Fourth Plenum" meeting by emphasizing a five-year plan to stimulate domestic consumption and advance homegrown technology amid ongoing tensions with the United States. The official readout called for balancing consumption with "effective investment" and expanding internal demand, though it stopped short of proposing direct cash handouts to consumers. Analysts are divided on the plan's effectiveness, with some expecting investment to focus on consumption-related sectors like public services, while others remain skeptical about a genuine shift away from an investment-led growth model without significant fiscal commitments to boost household income.</p>

          <h2>National Average for One-Year CD Yields Stands at 1.97%, Though Top Rates Exceed 4%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 09:10:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Current national average interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) vary by term, with the one-year yield at 1.97% APY as of October 22, 2025. However, top rates offered, particularly by online banks, are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs reaching 4.25% APY. An inverted yield curve phenomenon means that short-term CDs, such as those with six-month to one-year terms, currently offer higher returns than longer-term options. Financial experts suggest strategies like laddering CDs—investing in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates—to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining long-term savings goals.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of October 22, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.28%, while the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is 7.84%. These rates are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards, making them an attractive borrowing option for homeowners with significant equity. Home equity loans provide a lump-sum payment with a fixed rate, whereas HELOCs offer a revolving line of credit with a variable rate. While these products offer potential tax benefits, homeowners are cautioned that their property serves as collateral, risking foreclosure if payments are not made. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of October 22, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.33%, while the 15-year fixed rate is 5.72%, according to data collected by Money. These rates, while higher than in recent years, are showing signs of stabilization as the Federal Reserve is expected to pause its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, as top rates are typically offered to borrowers with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. Experts also recommend shopping around and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a deeply personal essay, the author reflects on his lifelong relationship with running, a passion inherited from his brilliant but troubled father. Running served as a source of discipline for his father before his life descended into chaos, and for the author, it became a way to both emulate and avoid his father's path. The narrative weaves through the author's own life challenges, including a battle with cancer, and how the discipline of marathon training helped him recover and find stability. Ultimately, running is portrayed as a vital practice that connects him to his past, grounds him in the present, and shapes his identity as a father, CEO, and survivor.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, a seasoned executive with nearly three decades of experience at Delta and Alaska Airlines, as its new senior vice president and chief commercial officer. The appointment follows the departure of the previous CCO after a controversial business-travel strategy failed, leading to a drop in revenue projections and leaving the carrier's profits behind rivals. Pieper, who most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance, will be responsible for the airline's commercial strategy, network planning, and loyalty program. His hiring is seen as a move to stabilize the commercial team and refocus on core business strategies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make the agency's "math error notices" clearer and more helpful for taxpayers. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, addresses concerns that the current notices for simple clerical mistakes are often confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct errors or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. In tax year 2023, the IRS sent over one million such notices. Lawmakers like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy championed the legislation to ensure taxpayers can resolve simple mistakes without needing expensive legal assistance.</p>

          <p>As Tanzania prepares for its general election on October 29, citizens are voicing their expectations for the next government, focusing on key areas like healthcare, education, and youth empowerment. Voters are calling for better access to quality medical care, especially for women, and reforms to the education system to align curricula with the modern job market. With the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party having dominated politics since 1977, there is also a desire for greater support for small businesses to tackle high youth unemployment. Despite some political tensions, the country's economic climate remains relatively stable heading into the election.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United, Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk called a players-only meeting to openly discuss the team's recent struggles. Van Dijk clarified that it was not a "crisis meeting" but an opportunity for the squad to come together and address their fourth consecutive loss, which left them four points behind the league leaders. The discussion appears to have had a positive effect, as Liverpool responded with a decisive 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League. Van Dijk emphasized the importance of unity and focus to navigate the team's difficult period.</p>
