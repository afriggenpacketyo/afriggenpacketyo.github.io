          <p>A Brown University sophomore, Alex Shieh, is facing disciplinary action after emailing non-faculty employees to inquire about their roles and responsibilities, mirroring Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) style. Representative Troy Nehls has intervened, urging the university to reconsider any disciplinary action, arguing it infringes on free expression and open inquiry. The university claims the issue is not about free speech but about potential misuse of non-public data and violation of IT policies. Tuition at Brown University is approximately $96,000 per year, and Nehls is seeking more information on how Brown uses its $7.2 billion endowment to improve the student experience or lower tuition.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential rise in the party's influence. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by just six votes, seizing a seat previously held by the Labour Party. This victory could indicate a shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system in British politics. The win was attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment, dissatisfaction with the economy, and tensions over immigration. </p>

          <p>London's FTSE 100 is on track for record-breaking gains, with market watchers suggesting it may have further to run. The FTSE 100 has gained 4.8% since the beginning of the year and is on track for its longest-ever run of daily gains. The UK's neutral position away from new US tariffs is partly fueling the rise of British stock markets, with investors seeking refuge from volatility in defensive giants like healthcare and energy. However, there are risks including geopolitical hotspots and revived tariff tensions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Michael Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the interim National Security Advisor. Sources indicate that Waltz's departure as national security advisor was prompted by frustration over a Signal chat mishap. Vance stated that Waltz will be more effective as a U.N. ambassador. Rubio will continue his role as Secretary of State while serving as National Security Advisor.</p>

          <p>U.S. payroll growth surpassed expectations in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 177,000, despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Health care and transportation sectors showed strong job creation, while the federal government experienced a slight loss. Economists suggest the strong job numbers indicate resilience in the economy before the tariff shock, but caution that the economy may weaken in the coming months. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following a better-than-expected April jobs report. Trump has been critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and has urged him to lower rates to spur economic growth. However, Trump has recently scaled back his criticism of Powell, whose job had previously appeared to be under threat. The message is a continuation of Trump's efforts to influence the central bank's decision-making process, challenging its long-held independence. </p>

The fragment, measuring 10 meters long and 3 meters wide, is believed to be of Mediterranean-style construction with Atlantic influences. The timbers of the vessel have been preserved by damp sand, requiring constant watering to prevent drying out.</p>

          <p>The article reviews the Marvel film *Thunderbolts*, noting it as a surprising success within the franchise. Despite a less-than-stellar premise, the film is described as fun and engaging, focusing on a misfit crew of antiheroes led by Yelena Belova. The action is characterized by more intimate, legible combat, and the story is relatively disconnected from the wider Marvel universe. The reviewer praises the ensemble cast and the film's thematic exploration of purpose in a world giving up on traditional superheroes.</p>
