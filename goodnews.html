          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a "failure," arguing that these policies prioritize national security over commercial interests. The author contends that the restrictions aim to prevent China's military advancement, regardless of Nvidia's market share in China. The piece asserts that China's innovation model is evolving, with Chinese firms combining global knowledge with domestic capital and policy. The author suggests Nvidia should focus on competing in other markets rather than its diminishing market share in China, highlighting the importance of safeguarding leading-edge technologies for U.S. strategic advantage.</p>

According to Dr. Bartosz Bartoszewicz, the addition of health as a category was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and surprisingly, most of the cities that were gold cities in the past remain.

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with companies like OpenAI. The upgraded model, released on AI model repository Hugging Face, demonstrates improvements in reasoning, math, and code capabilities. Adina Yakefu, an AI researcher at Hugging Face, notes that the new model is closing in on top-tier models like Gemini and O3, with major improvements in inference and hallucination reduction. DeepSeek has become a prominent example of Chinese AI development despite U.S. efforts to restrict access to technology.</p>

          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions.

The resumption of deliveries signals a potential easing of trade relations and a positive outlook for Boeing's international sales.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a federal agency adequately considered the environmental impact of a proposed railway in Utah, limiting the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law. The ruling concerned a 3,600-page report on the impact of an 88-mile railway connecting oil fields to a national rail network. Justice Kavanaugh wrote that an agency may weigh environmental consequences as it reasonably sees fit. The decision came after environmental groups and a Colorado county sued, arguing the report did not account for all potential environmental harm.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current rates, savers are considering short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to maximize returns. Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY) due to market uncertainty. Experts recommend evaluating financial goals and liquidity needs before deciding, as CD funds are not easily accessible without penalties. While short-term CDs are favored for higher rates and earlier maturity, long-term CDs may appeal to those seeking fixed-rate growth with certainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law, not a judicial coup. The ruling asserts that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes Trump to impose the tariffs. The author emphasizes that the Constitution delegates tariff power to Congress, and the court's ruling merely affirmed Congress's power, not the judiciary's. The states involved in the lawsuit, as democratically accountable entities, sought to vindicate their rights under the law.</p>

          <p>Having $2 million in retirement savings can provide a comfortable retirement, but spending must be managed to avoid running out of money. Using the 4% rule, retirees can safely withdraw about $80,000 per year, or $6,667 per month, from their investments. Combining this with Social Security income could provide a more substantial monthly budget. A sample budget using the 4% rule, combined with average Social Security income, results in about $7,225 in take-home pay after taxes. (not investment advice)</p>
