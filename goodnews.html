          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, particularly by companies like SpaceX, physicists are studying the sounds of spaceflight to understand and address the growing noise pollution; researchers like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University are analyzing sonic booms and other acoustic phenomena generated by rockets. SpaceX is testing Starship, which is likely the loudest rocket ever. This research aims to inform regulations and limits on rocket noise, ensuring that space exploration can continue without causing unacceptable disruptions to communities. The goal is to find ways to lessen the noise impact before it becomes a widespread problem.</p>

The EU seeks to reduce existing tariffs and proposes a "zero-for-zero" strategy, but the path to de-escalation remains uncertain. The delay grants more time for discussions, but the underlying tensions and divergent objectives continue to pose challenges.</p>

It notes that the Trump administration's efforts to undercut electric vehicle growth and favor oil echo historical trends, and also highlights the impact of gender stereotypes on the adoption of electric vehicles.
