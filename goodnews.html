          <h2>President Trump Announces Coca-Cola Will Switch to Cane Sugar, A Move with Debatable Health Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to produce its soda using "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a change he championed for its superior taste. While the move has been praised by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the article notes that the health benefits are largely negligible, as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The announcement is framed as a symbolic political win for Trump, aligning with a "Make America healthy again" theme but lacking substantial public health impact. It reflects a pattern of pressuring companies for headline-grabbing changes that may not address underlying issues like overall sugar consumption.</p>

          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Suggests Potential Changes to TSA's Carry-On Liquid Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures and that the rules on liquid sizes "may be the next big announcement." This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security checks. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, possibly rendering the 3.4-ounce liquid limit obsolete in the future.</p>

          <h2>Annual Congressional Women's Softball Game Unites Lawmakers for Charity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:31:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, D.C., as female lawmakers from both parties played together on one team. The game, which pits "Team Congress" against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the event has raised nearly $5 million. Participants and attendees, including a survivor who traveled from Florida, highlighted the importance of setting aside political divisions to support a common and personal cause.</p>

          <p>The article provides reviews for several new films, highlighting a variety of genres and the presence of Latino talent. The new "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is critiqued as being practically superior to the original but ultimately unmemorable, despite its self-aware humor. Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, is described as an ambitious and realistic departure from his previous work, tackling pandemic-era themes. Other films reviewed include "Tardes de soledad," a difficult-to-watch documentary on bullfighting, and two distinct LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each praised for their sensitive portrayals.</p>

          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core to Uncover Ancient Climate History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:18:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey are beginning to melt and analyze an ice core believed to be up to 1.5 million years old, making it the oldest ever retrieved. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold crucial information about Earth's past climate. Researchers hope the data will illuminate a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's glacial cycles changed dramatically. Understanding this "unknown period" could revolutionize knowledge of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current high levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June, Though Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely in line with market expectations. This easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices. Despite the slowdown, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider future interest rate hikes. However, concerns about economic growth, fueled by potential U.S. tariffs and a decline in first-quarter GDP, complicate the policy outlook for the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:14:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom, set to take effect next July, will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is designed to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. As a result, some users may be denied this form of credit. The new rules will also grant consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and ensure clearer information on terms, bringing the currently unregulated BNPL sector more in line with other forms of lending.</p>

          <p>The England women's national team advanced to the Euro 2025 semifinals after a chaotic and nerve-wracking penalty shootout against Sweden. The shootout was a rollercoaster of misses and saves, with both goalkeepers making multiple stops and several players failing to convert their kicks. After Sweden's goalkeeper missed a crucial penalty that would have won the match, England's Lucy Bronze scored what would become the decisive kick. Sweden's final attempt went over the crossbar, sealing a dramatic 3-2 shootout victory for the Lionesses in a game described by players as both overwhelming and underwhelming.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The disclosure came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swelling in his legs. A letter from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" and stated that tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the hand bruising to "tissue damage from frequent handshaking" combined with aspirin use, reiterating that the president is in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders.

Investors were seeking to have the defendants personally reimburse Meta for billions in fines and legal costs, including a $5.1 billion FTC penalty. Details of the settlement, which was announced just before the second day of the trial was set to begin, were not immediately made public.</p>

Ford acknowledged that the diagnostics business in China underperformed but emphasized that the fundamentals of the company remain strong, with double-digit growth in its medical devices segment. He expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage through the temporary challenges, particularly with its strong product pipeline and performance in other global markets.

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving," avoiding jail time for his 2024 DUI citation. The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep in his Rolls-Royce, which was blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation, a fine, and is required to complete two online courses. The NFL stated that the incident remains under review, and Addison could still face a suspension under the league's substance abuse policy.</p>
