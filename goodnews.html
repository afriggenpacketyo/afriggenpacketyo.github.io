          <h2>Home Depot to Maintain Current Pricing Despite Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to cover tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales originate in the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. Despite beating sales estimates, Home Depot missed first-quarter earnings expectations, reflecting a challenging backdrop of muted sales growth due to higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a fisherman, recently discovered the J.C. Ames, a tugboat intentionally sunk in 1923, in Lake Michigan near Manitowoc. The Wisconsin Historical Society announced the discovery, highlighting that the ship, built in 1881 for the lumber trade, rested nine feet below the surface. Tamara Thomsen, a maritime archaeologist, expressed excitement about the resurfacing of lost history and appreciated Thuss's report. The J.C. Ames, once one of the largest tugs on the lakes, was dismantled and burned before being abandoned, a common practice at the time.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook is set to make his international debut for England in the upcoming Test match against Zimbabwe, as confirmed by coach Brendon McCullum. The 27-year-old will join an inexperienced bowling lineup alongside Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, and spinner Shoaib Bashir. Matthew Potts and James Rew have been left out of the 13-strong squad. Zak Crawley remains the opener, while Ollie Pope returns to number three, and Jamie Smith is back as wicketkeeper after paternity leave. The four-day Test, Zimbabwe's first in England since 2003, will commence at Trent Bridge on Thursday.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto about his effort level after the outfielder failed to run hard on a ball that bounced off the Green Monster for a single. This marks the second instance in two days where Soto's lack of hustle has been questioned, drawing criticism from fans. While Soto denies any lack of effort, Mendoza emphasized the importance of running hard out of the batter's box, particularly in Fenway Park. The Mets, despite Soto's mixed start since signing a record contract, are tied for the second-best record in MLB.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump, both prominent figures with New Jersey connections, are embroiled in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration from a British stage. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggested investigating his and Beyonc√©'s political endorsements. Springsteen had described the American government as "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous," prompting Trump's sharp rebuke. This is not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Republican presidents, challenging his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements.</p>

          <h2>Three-Eyed Ancient Predator Discovered in Canada</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:07:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a fossil of a three-eyed predator, named Mosura fentoni, in Canada's Burgess Shale, dating back over 500 million years. This creature, about the size of an index finger, possessed spiny jointed claws, a circular mouth with teeth, and swimming flaps. Mosura, part of the extinct radiodont group, is described as unlike any living animal, with a unique abdomen-like body region. The discovery provides insights into the early evolution of arthropods and their adaptations, including efficient respiration.</p>
