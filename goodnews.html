          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:47:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death at age 91, fashion experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy as not just a designer but a masterful business leader who built a global empire. He is credited with revolutionizing office attire with the softly tailored power suit for men and later adapting it for women, tapping into the feminist movement of the era. Armani pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements, dressing stars for films and red carpet events, which significantly elevated his brand's global profile. Crucially, by retaining full ownership of his company, he maintained creative control and consistency across a diverse portfolio that expanded from couture to accessible luxury, home goods, and even chocolates.</p>

          <p>In response to political attacks, current employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have issued a statement reaffirming the public's trust in the government's economic data. This comes after President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weak July jobs report, which he claimed was rigged. The employees emphasize that their work is guided by statistical practice, not partisan influence, and that revisions to jobs numbers are a normal part of ensuring accuracy as more data becomes available. They defended the fired commissioner and vowed to continue publishing reliable data regardless of political pressure, underscoring the importance of their agency's independence.</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign, a landmark at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years, is being temporarily dismantled to accommodate a significant roadway reconfiguration project. The construction aims to improve traffic flow, enhance pedestrian access, and create more direct routes to economy parking, which is part of a larger modernization effort ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics. The letters will be stored nearby and reinstalled in a new location compatible with the updated road designs upon the project's completion. While there is no firm timeline for the sign's return, the overall project is expected to be finished by 2030.</p>

          <h2>Average 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Experiences Largest Single-Day Decline in Over a Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its largest one-day drop since August 2024. This decline offers potential relief for homebuyers facing high home prices, as it can reduce monthly payments by a noticeable amount. For example, the monthly payment on a $450,000 home would be about $169 lower compared to the recent peak rate of 7.08% in May. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop is substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained sluggish and overall economic uncertainty continues to keep many potential buyers on the sidelines.

Emerson allegedly attempted to activate the plane's fire suppression system, which would have cut fuel to the engines, while riding in the cockpit's jump seat. He later told police he had taken psychedelic mushrooms days earlier, was sleep-deprived, and believed he was in a dream. Under the agreements, he will plead guilty to a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew and no-contest to state charges, with prosecutors recommending a sentence that could avoid additional prison time.</p>

          <h2>Transportation Department Withdraws Proposed Rule for Cash Compensation for Flight Disruptions</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to offer cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from airlines, who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider such extra-statutory requirements while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds. Airline industry groups praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from overly burdensome regulations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:41:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online activities, such as browsing property or shopping websites, is not a valid reason for dismissal. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage. The ruling noted that the employee's personal browsing was not excessive, the company had no clear policy against it, and even the boss used a work computer for personal reasons. The judge concluded the real motive for the dismissal was likely to replace the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger unfair dismissal rights.</p>

          <h2>Navigating an Inheritance in a Community-Property State While Protecting it from a Spouse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses how to protect an inheritance from being considered community property in states like Arizona, ensuring it remains separate in the event of a divorce. The primary advice is to avoid commingling the funds with marital assets by opening a separate brokerage account solely in the recipient's name. Placing the inheritance into joint accounts or even some types of retirement accounts like a 401(k) could risk it being classified as a marital asset subject to division. Investing the money in a diversified portfolio of ETFs or mutual funds through a separate account is recommended to maintain its legal status as separate property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reunion of the iconic British rock band Oasis is creating a wave of excitement in Los Angeles, with fans likening the atmosphere to Beatlemania ahead of their concert at the Rose Bowl.

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the US Open final, marking a remarkable comeback after a devastating 6-0, 6-0 loss in the Wimbledon final earlier this year.

Her journey reflects significant personal growth, partly attributed to a mental health break in 2023 and an embrace of therapy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, individuals with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) need to consider their options to avoid being locked into lower returns. Instead of automatically rolling over a CD, savers might explore high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive rates and greater flexibility, though their rates are variable. Another option is a money market account, which combines high interest with check-writing capabilities. Alternatively, investing in a new long-term CD could be a strategic move to lock in a fixed interest rate for several years, providing security against further market declines.
