          <p>OpenAI has named Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as the head of its applications business, where she will report directly to CEO Sam Altman. Simo, who previously served on OpenAI's board, will focus on scaling the company's traditional functions as it enters a new phase of growth. This move comes shortly after OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation, addressing concerns from civic leaders and former employees. Altman will shift his focus towards research, compute, and safety systems, while Brad Lightcap continues to oversee business operations and global deployment.</p>

          <p>Two men were arrested after causing a disturbance at an elementary school in Tachikawa, a suburb of Tokyo, resulting in minor injuries to five teachers. The men, aged 31 and 47, allegedly broke into the Daisan Elementary School, where a parent involved in a consultation had reportedly summoned them. While there were no immediate reports of injuries to the approximately 520 children enrolled at the school, the suspects were apprehended on suspicion of assault.

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the U.S., potentially making it the first country to do so after the U.S. announced "reciprocal" tariffs. While details remain uncertain, it is speculated that both sides may sign either a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations. A U.K. Department for Business and Trade spokesperson stated that talks are ongoing and that the department aims to find a resolution to ease pressure on UK businesses and consumers. The U.K. was spared higher tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties but was still hit with a baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie has been created using AI to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about posthumous representation. While Christie's family estate approved the project and emphasized using her own words, critics argue that Christie herself cannot consent to this use of her image and ideas. The debate highlights broader concerns about AI's impact on artistic integrity and the potential for misrepresentation, even with safeguards in place. Despite the controversy, creators believe Christie, known for her adventurous spirit, would have appreciated the innovative approach.</p>

The team estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil in the region, with the most promising deposits buried 5-7 meters underground.
