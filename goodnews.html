          <h2>China and Vietnam to Hold First-Ever Joint Army Drills Amid Shifting Geopolitics</h2>

          <p>China and Vietnam will conduct their first joint army exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, focusing on joint border patrol training. This military collaboration signifies a deepening of practical cooperation between the two nations, marking the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. The move comes as China, Vietnam's largest trading partner, seeks to strengthen regional alliances in the face of ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This closer relationship was also highlighted by the Chinese military's recent participation in Vietnam's annual celebration of the fall of Saigon.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order for the bear to be euthanized. The incident sparked a debate over human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has grown significantly. JJ4 will now live in a specially designed, secure enclosure, and her arrival at the sanctuary was reported as calm and stable.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Discovery in China Suggests Some Pterosaurs May Have Been Herbivores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil found in northeastern China is challenging previous assumptions about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus contained stomach contents with phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants. Researchers also found small quartz crystals, likely gastroliths or "stomach stones" used to help grind tough plant matter, a feature seen in modern birds and lizards. This is the first time such evidence has been found in a pterodactyloid pterosaur, providing the first direct confirmation of herbivory in this group.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Explores Parental Guilt and Economic Realities Behind Summer Childcare Choices</h2>

          <p>A contributor reflects on the societal and financial pressures parents face regarding summer plans for their children, contrasting her own unscheduled summer with her kids against those who rely on expensive camps. The article argues that recent media discussions about letting kids have a "'90s summer" often miss the economic realities that dictate these choices for most families. It suggests the debate isn't about the value of camp versus unstructured time, but about a societal system that fails to support working parents, particularly mothers who bear the majority of the mental load for household planning.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges into Waterways by 2030</h2>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling the current water sector "broken." The government's "water revolution" will also involve tougher penalties for water company executives who fail to meet standards, potentially including prison sentences. This marks the first time a clear target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following public outrage over record levels of pollution and rising water bills. The plan also includes a ban on wet wipes containing plastic and aims to cut phosphorus pollution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, astronomers have captured the first direct evidence of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located 1,370 light-years away, the infant star's surrounding gas disk showed signs of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing, the essential building blocks for planets like Earth. This discovery provides an unprecedented look into the processes that may have occurred at the beginning of our own solar system. The finding suggests that the initial steps of planet formation could be a common process in the universe.</p>
