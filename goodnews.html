        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new comedy "Good Fortune," written and directed by Aziz Ansari, offers a satirical take on the wealth gap through a story reminiscent of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Trading Places." The film stars Ansari as a struggling gig worker who swaps lives with a wealthy tech bro, played by Seth Rogen, after an encounter with a guardian angel portrayed by Keanu Reeves. While the article notes that the film's laughs are inconsistent, it praises the movie for its heartfelt examination of class struggles and commends Reeves's performance. The review also welcomes Ansari's return to prominence after his career was previously sidetracked.</p>

          <p>As the average price of Halloween costumes continues to rise, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes made from thrifted materials. For nine years, he has been collecting, redesigning, and sewing garments, which he then gives away for free at community events. Waggoner spends thousands of his own money annually on this project, driven by the belief that every child deserves to experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their family's financial situation. His efforts inspire others in the community to donate their old costumes, creating a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>Nathan Thomas, a sophomore at Jefferson County High School in Georgia, is working to combat youth apathy in politics by establishing a Youth City Council in Wrens. He presented a proposal to the city council, outlining a structure that mirrors the actual local government to give young people an active role in community events and decisions. Thomas hopes this initiative will serve as a model for a similar county-level youth commission, fostering future leaders and providing a platform for their voices. His efforts are part of a broader commitment to public service, which includes involvement in political campaigns and leadership workshops.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, as indicated by the CBOE Volatility Index, some investors are seeking more stable investment options. John Burrello, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco, suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can provide structural protection against wild market swings. He argues these strategies offer downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is particularly relevant as policymakers consider rate cuts. Burrello advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields with high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager for commitment, a recent study by DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute found that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, revealed that financial savings were a primary motivator for men wanting to move in or marry sooner. Experts suggest that beyond finances, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when single. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report more men seeking their services.</p>

          <p>The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has announced that a "complex repair plan" is in progress to restore the main power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The plant, which is Europe's largest, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks after its last external power line was severed during attacks. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have established special ceasefire zones to allow for the crucial repairs to proceed safely. Restoring a stable power connection is considered essential for cooling the plant's reactors and preventing a potential nuclear incident.</p>

The group provides a space for men to be vulnerable and share their struggles with systemic racism, economic pressures, and societal expectations of masculinity.

She emphasizes that applicants often make the mistake of only applying for large, national scholarships with immense competition. Instead, she recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships that have narrower criteria, which significantly reduces the applicant pool. Greene also stresses the importance of persistence, noting that winning is a numbers game and that students should aim to apply for 100 to 200 scholarships to maximize their chances of success.</p>

He describes the first category as currency-denominated assets like bonds, which he views as a bet on government stability that often loses value over time. The second, which includes gold, consists of assets that don't produce anything and rely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them later. Buffett prefers the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which are valued based on what they can generate, making their success independent of daily market fluctuations.</p>
