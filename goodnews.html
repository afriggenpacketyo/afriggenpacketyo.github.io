          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record-breaking pre-order sales in China, significantly surpassing last year's iPhone 16 series within minutes of launch on platforms like JD.com. Despite overwhelming demand causing temporary access difficulties on Apple's website and extended waiting periods for some variants, the standard iPhone 17 with 256GB storage proved most popular. Customers experienced processing delays and rapid booking of in-store pickup slots, yet many successfully secured launch-day deliveries, highlighting the intense competition and enduring consumer desire for the latest technology. The article notes that some regions face waiting periods extending to October.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, affirmed the region's openness to Chinese investment, despite growing economic tensions between the European Union and China. Aiwanger emphasized that while Europe needs greater economic resilience and self-sufficiency, protectionism and isolationism are not the solution, applying this principle to major economies like China, the USA, and Japan. He stated that Bavaria continues to welcome numerous Chinese companies, a position that diverges from some broader EU strategies. This approach highlights a regional commitment to maintaining strong international economic ties, balancing global cooperation with the need for internal economic strength. The article notes the historical significance of German-Chinese diplomatic exchanges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are aggressively expanding into the European market, challenging established legacy automakers on their home turf, as evidenced at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich. Companies like Xpeng and GAC are setting ambitious sales targets and introducing competitively priced models, capitalizing on Europe's perceived lag in EV development and Tesla's declining sales in the region. Despite potential EU tariffs, Chinese firms leverage their advantages in affordability, battery technology, and production scale, often positioning themselves as tech companies with advanced in-car gadgets. European automakers are responding with new EV models and technological innovations, but face significant pressure to accelerate their pace and overcome legacy structures to compete effectively in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>

          <p>As autumn nights lengthen, skygazers can anticipate several celestial events, including Saturn reaching its closest and brightest point to Earth on September 21st, appearing as a non-twinkling star in Pisces. This phenomenon, known as opposition, makes Saturn easily visible to the naked eye, though a telescope is needed to discern its famous rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will occur between October 2nd and November 7th, peaking around October 22nd. This article notes ideal viewing conditions for the Orionids due to the new moon, offering fast-moving meteors with long streaks of light. These events provide excellent opportunities for observation as daylight hours decrease.</p>

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly fled the Catholic care home where they were placed and returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps, with the help of former students and a locksmith. The nuns, who had spent decades at the convent and school, claim they were forcibly removed against their will in December 2023, despite a lifelong right of residence. Church authorities, represented by Provost Markus Grasl, deem their return "completely incomprehensible," citing the convent's unsuitable conditions for their "precarious health." This article captures their determination to remain in their cherished home, with supporters providing essential aid and arguing that "Goldenstein without the nuns is just not possible."</p>
