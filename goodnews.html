          <p>China has introduced a new plan to strengthen its cattle industry and promote consumption of high-quality domestic beef amid falling prices and competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system to enhance the appeal of local products. Officials state there is significant room for growth in consumption, as the diet of many Chinese residents lacks sufficient high-quality protein. Wholesale beef prices have slightly rebounded from an eight-year low in March but remain significantly lower than the average prices before 2023, signaling a need for market stabilization and support for local producers.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have been instructed to cease deportations under a specific asylum ban following a federal appeals court order. The ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially limited the ban, stating it cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. Consequently, Customs and Border Protection officials were directed to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the contested policy. This development stems from a legal challenge brought by the ACLU, which argued that the broad ban violates both U.S. and international law.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks a significant tightening of the strategic partnership between the two nations and is Japan's first warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation vessels as the best capability for Australia's needs. This purchase is part of a major restructuring of Australia's military to enhance long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by 45 county district attorneys, claimed that waste containing corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials was sent to landfills not equipped to handle them. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs to prevent future violations. The settlement includes $1.4 million in civil penalties, with the remainder covering costs and funding supplemental environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, leading to increased sightings of the spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. The season, which runs from August to December, sees male tarantulas traveling up to 20 miles, making them more visible in chaparral, deserts, and mountain areas. Experts note that while their appearance can be startling, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their bodies are covered in irritant hairs used for defense, which can cause a rash if touched, but their venom is not considered a serious threat.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Donald Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was best to not accept the position. He was among a list of prominent sports figures invited to join the council, which is being re-established alongside the Presidential Fitness Test. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, noted his respect for the office but expressed surprise at being considered for the role.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered in a cave in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The discovery was made by a team of archaeologists and cavers surveying caverns near Ingleborough as part of a National Lottery-funded heritage project. Researchers also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into the prehistoric use of the landscape by early farmers and highlight the role of recreational cavers in making significant archaeological discoveries.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised a controversial marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which played on the word "genes/jeans," had drawn criticism for its perceived racial undertones, but Trump's endorsement on social media sparked a rally in the company's stock. He contrasted the campaign with what he called "woke" advertising from other brands, celebrating American Eagle's approach. The stock surge follows a period of financial difficulty for the retailer, which had recently withdrawn its full-year guidance due to slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings for this demographic increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This led to a 12% annual jump in early-stage diagnoses between 2019 and 2022, a sharp rise from the 1.1% increase seen previously. Researchers called the findings promising but warned that screening rates for this group remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all populations.</p>

          <p>A Birmingham woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm feels hopeful about new, stricter gun licensing laws in the UK. Emma Ambler has campaigned for tighter controls since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate police checks for signs of domestic abuse. Ambler believes these changes are a meaningful step toward preventing similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) recommends that patients coming off obesity injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive check-ups for at least a year. This advice from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) addresses the common issue of patients regaining weight after stopping treatment. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and that patients need structured support, including behavioral habit-building and healthy lifestyle plans, to maintain their weight loss. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK are on these drugs, though most are paying privately.</p>
