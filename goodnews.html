          <p>Meta's stock price increased by 10% following the release of its second-quarter earnings, which surpassed revenue expectations. The company reported revenue of $47.52 billion against an anticipated $44.80 billion and provided a third-quarter sales forecast that also exceeded Wall Street estimates. While its Reality Labs division continues to operate at a loss, the deficit was smaller than predicted, and the company's family of apps saw growth in daily active users. The positive results come as Meta invests heavily in its "personal superintelligence" AI strategy, leading to increased expense outlooks for the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

For the first time, Microsoft disclosed that its Azure and cloud services revenue surpassed $75 billion for the fiscal year, with Azure itself growing 39% in the quarter.

          <p>Baltimore Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins made a remarkable defensive play, robbing the Toronto Blue Jays of a potential home run during a recent game. Scaling the center field wall, Mullins reached over to snatch the ball just before it could clear the fence, a feat that is being hailed as a catch of the year candidate. This play comes just days after he made another home run-robbing catch and an impressive diving play. Despite his individual heroics, the Orioles ultimately lost the game to the Blue Jays 9-8 amid ongoing trade deadline activities for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee announced its decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The committee's statement noted that economic growth moderated in the first half of the year, while inflation remains somewhat elevated. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed Governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy remains in good shape but faces risks, justifying the "wait-and-see" approach as the central bank monitors tariffs and incoming economic data.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 16:08:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, many savers are turning to high-yield savings accounts to maximize their returns. This article explores the potential earnings of a $10,000 deposit in such an account, demonstrating how different annual percentage yields (APYs) can impact growth over time. For example, at a 4.30% APY, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $430 in one year. However, it is noted that these accounts have variable rates that can change with market conditions, unlike the fixed rates offered by certificates of deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite its low ratings on travel websites, the Hollywood Premiere Motel has been designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument by the Los Angeles City Council. The 1960s-era motel is being recognized for its well-preserved mid-century Googie architecture, a style that defined roadside tourism in that period. Its unique look has made it a popular filming location for productions like "Twin Peaks" and "Fargo." While the landmark designation does not guarantee protection from demolition or mandate renovations, it requires any proposed changes to be reviewed by the city's Office of Historic Resources.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate steady. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed over 4 basis points, reacting to the Fed's decision and comments from Chair Jerome Powell about tariff-related inflation concerns. The market movement was also influenced by a stronger-than-expected GDP report, which showed the U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter. This economic data reinforces the Fed's position to maintain current rates, leading investors to adjust their positions in the bond market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations and reinstated its full-year financial guidance, which it had previously suspended due to tariff uncertainty. The new outlook projects adjusted earnings between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, factoring in an estimated $2 billion net impact from tariffs. The company's "Pro" commercial business was a key growth driver, while its "Model e" electric vehicle division continued to post significant losses. Ford's total vehicle sales saw a notable 14.2% increase from the previous year, driven largely by hybrid vehicle demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is a top target for several Premier League clubs this summer, including Manchester United and Newcastle United. The 22-year-old Slovenian international, valued at around £70 million, is known for his height, speed, and clinical finishing, drawing comparisons to Erling Haaland. Despite a strong record of 39 goals in the last two seasons, there is no certainty he will leave Leipzig, though the club's failure to qualify for European competition could be a factor. An informal agreement reportedly exists that would allow him to leave if an elite club meets the asking price.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. Her decision ends months of speculation and opens up the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom. In her statement, Harris indicated she would not seek elected office "for now" but plans to remain politically active by helping elect Democrats nationwide. Her withdrawal leaves a crowded field of Democratic candidates, including Xavier Becerra and Antonio Villaraigosa, to compete for the state's top office in a political landscape altered by the 2024 election results.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) present more affordable borrowing options compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. As of late July 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.26%. The article explains the difference between the two products: home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving line of credit. It also notes the potential for tax deductions if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Life sciences company Danaher has seen its stock rise following a better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report, but analysts remain cautious about its long-term prospects. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, tariff impacts, and reduced spending from biotech customers. While Danaher raised its full-year earnings guidance, it did not increase its revenue outlook, citing ongoing uncertainty, particularly in China. Analysts suggest a sustained rally for the sector is unlikely until it returns to consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, which may still be a few quarters away. (not investment advice)</p>
