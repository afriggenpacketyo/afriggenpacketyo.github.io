          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 16:30:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from restricting Harvard's access to a student visa database. Trump stated that negotiations with Harvard were progressing well and could lead to a historic settlement. The dispute arose after DHS accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism and threatened to revoke its student visa system certification. The legal battles and potential settlement talks highlight the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and universities over issues such as foreign student enrollment and campus policies. The outcome of these negotiations could significantly impact Harvard's international student population and its relationship with the government. </p>

Meta's interest in Perplexity reflects Mark Zuckerberg's strong push to enhance the company's AI capabilities amidst intense competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, following his detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations against the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and foreign students. The judge determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to the community, despite arguments from the government citing potential adverse foreign policy consequences. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release marks a victory for immigrant rights advocates. </p>
