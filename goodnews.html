          <p>This Kyodo News digest covers several topics, including ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the United States, where common ground on tariffs remains elusive but both sides aim for a deal in mid-June. A survey reveals that over half of rice-producing firms in Japan feel store prices are too high, sparking concerns about consumer aversion. South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung will make his diplomatic debut at the G7 summit in Canada, while in Kyoto, a Chinese tourist was slashed after an argument. Japan's shogi board game association appointed its first female chief, and securities firms are donating shareholder perks to support children in poverty amid inflation.</p>

          <p>Susan Dominus, after interviewing parents of highly successful children, highlights five key strategies they employed. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, understanding that learning can happen anywhere, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than acting as a coach. The parents emphasized the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel empowered to explore their passions and develop a deep curiosity, shifting the focus from merely encouraging hard work to fostering a love of learning.</p>
