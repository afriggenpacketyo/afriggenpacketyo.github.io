          <p>A recent antitrust ruling against Google, initially focused on its search engine monopoly, now raises questions about the future of artificial intelligence competition. Federal Judge Amit Mehta aimed to curb Google's search dominance without hindering its AI development, but analysts fear the company's vast data gives it an unfair advantage in the generative AI space. The Department of Justice's desired stiff penalties, like Chrome divestment, were not fully granted, though Google must share some search data and is barred from exclusive deals for AI chatbots. This article highlights the judiciary's struggle to regulate rapidly evolving technology and the ongoing debate over Google's potential dominance in the AI market.</p>
