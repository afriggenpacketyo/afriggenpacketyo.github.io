        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are preparing for a total lunar eclipse this evening, which will transform the full Moon into a striking "Blood Moon." While the full eclipse starts at 18:30 and lasts until 19:52, visibility in the UK depends on moonrise times, with eastern parts getting the longest view. Dr. Edward Bloomer of the Royal Observatory Greenwich highlights the event as a rare opportunity to witness the mechanics of the solar system in action. This celestial phenomenon, caused by Earth blocking sunlight and refracting red light through its atmosphere, was last visible in the UK in 2022.</p>

The lucky ticketholders can choose between a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million each or 30 increasing annual payments. The odds of winning were 1 in 292.2 million, concluding a streak that tied the game's record for consecutive drawings without a top prize winner.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, advocating against oligarchic control and supporting progressive policies. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, has garnered significant progressive backing by vowing to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement as a "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail" against billionaire donors and media oligarchs. The event highlighted a broader struggle for the Democratic Party's future, as mainstream Democrats have been slow to embrace Mamdani's agenda.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a commanding 59-20 victory over Clay Helton's Georgia Southern team, with quarterback Jayden Maiava leading a potent offense that amassed 755 yards. This performance marked USC's most yards in two decades, showcasing their offensive efficiency for the second consecutive week. Maiava threw four touchdowns and shattered his career high in passing yards, while the rushing attack also thrived with 309 yards. Despite some defensive breakdowns, the Trojans' overwhelming firepower secured the win, offering a cathartic experience for fans still critical of former coach Helton.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles, a process known as cavitation. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse, generating a strong force. This mechanism can propel small jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air and also enable them to swim. The study, published in Science, highlights the efficiency of cavitation as a launching mechanism, opening new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states, including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are implementing Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce new statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. This system requires students to place their phones in a locked pouch upon arrival, which can only be unlocked at designated stations. Educators and parents support the measure to reduce distractions and foster greater student engagement, with some students reporting immediate benefits like increased social interaction. Despite initial skepticism and attempts by some students to bypass the system, the company aims to create a cultural shift towards phone-free learning environments, with a significant increase in schools adopting the technology.</p>

          <p>China utilized the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin as a significant diplomatic platform to project its vision for a multipolar international system. The article suggests Beijing aimed to burnish its geopolitical profile as a reliable interlocutor and an alternative voice for global governance, especially amidst perceived US credibility issues under Donald Trump. A key image of President Xi Jinping engaging cheerfully with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi symbolized unexpected bonhomie, particularly given past tensions between India and China. This summit underscored China's efforts to establish itself at the global high table and challenge established norms.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats after an adult woman reportedly took a home run ball from him during a game against the Miami Marlins, an incident that quickly went viral. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, whose father initially secured it for him, only for the woman to claim it was hers. Both the Phillies and Marlins organizations responded by ensuring the young fan, Lincoln Feltwell, received a gift bag of Marlins swag and later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who gifted him an autographed bat. The Phillies also won the game 9-3.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to broaden its political presence and leadership beyond its prominent figure, Nigel Farage, as it prepares for upcoming elections. The party aims to significantly increase its representation in councils and parliaments, driven by strong national opinion poll leads. To achieve this, Reform UK is promoting new candidates, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, who have defected from the Conservative Party. Farage has called for 5,000 vetted candidates for next year's polls, emphasizing the need for a "people's army" and a more rigorous candidate selection process to avoid past scandals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who served in dangerous front-line military roles. She co-founded "Sisters in Service," a community interest company that connects female veterans working in healthcare, providing mutual support. Dr. Bennett highlights that many people hold "outdated ideas" about women's combat involvement, leading to isolation for female veterans who often face misconceptions. The group aims to create a "cathartic" community where women can share experiences, contrasting with traditional veterans' spaces where they may feel misunderstood.</p>
