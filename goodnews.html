        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is still uncertain as ranked-choice voting comes into play. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the initial tally, which includes mail-in ballots and first-choice votes. Mamdani received endorsements from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, while Cuomo seeks a political comeback after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations. The final outcome will depend on ranked-choice tabulations, which begin on July 1, potentially influenced by a recent heatwave and voter turnout.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and devoured a week's worth of honey. The bears then fell asleep after their snack, posing no threat to the public. Park staff used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine how the escape occurred. The park has assured the public that this was an isolated incident and they are taking measures to prevent it from happening again.</p>

          <p>Electric car and heat pump adoption is growing in the UK, but further increases are needed to meet climate goals, according to the Climate Change Committee. The committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring households benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills. While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen significantly since 1990, transport and buildings remain the biggest emitters. The CCC suggests making electricity cheaper by removing charges related to renewable energy projects from household bills.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge ruled that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's electric vehicle infrastructure program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

Witkoff also stated that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and that it is "not even conceivable" that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have found that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, offering insights into how new stars are born. By studying thousands of stars, researchers discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
