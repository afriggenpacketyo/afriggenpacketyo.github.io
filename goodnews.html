Colleagues, however, note his focus extends beyond budgets to strategic investments in areas like streaming technology and international expansion.

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee. This new model is notable for being the brand's first hybrid vehicle in North America, featuring a 1.6-liter turbo-four engine that offers over 500 miles per tank. Positioned between the Compass and Grand Cherokee models, the company hopes this technologically updated SUV will reinvigorate the brand's performance in a highly competitive market segment. The release comes as Stellantis also navigates financial pressures from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Troubled cosmetics company Revolution Beauty has announced the return of its co-founders, Adam Minto and Tom Allsworth, to lead a business 'reset' after failing to find a suitable buyer. The company, which has faced plummeting sales and previous accounting issues that led to the founders' resignations, will also seek to raise £15 million by issuing new shares. Allsworth will return as CEO while Minto will serve as a consultant as they implement a new strategy aimed at restoring long-term profitability. The company reported a pre-tax loss of £16.8 million, a sharp reversal from an £11.4 million profit the prior year. (not investment advice)</p>

The police stated the intelligence-led arrests were intended to disrupt individuals believed to pose a significant risk to public safety at the event, which has seen serious violence in recent years. Authorities will also deploy Live Facial Recognition (LFR) technology and screening arches at entry points to deter criminality. The measures are part of a broader policing plan that prioritizes tackling serious violence at the large-scale cultural celebration.</p>

          <p>Danish tennis player Holger Rune, currently ranked world No. 11, speaks about his clear ambition to win Grand Slams and become the top-ranked player. He acknowledges that his main challenge is not defeating top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, against whom he has a strong record, but maintaining consistency throughout the tour. Rune reveals he has recently consulted with tennis legend Andre Agassi to gain a unique perspective on his game and mental strategy.

          <h2>Study Finds Cash Grants in Kenya Halved Infant Mortality, But Questions of Cost-Effectiveness Remain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 07:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant new study from GiveDirectly found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to thousands of households in rural Kenya led to a 48 percent reduction in infant and child mortality. The study suggests the cash enabled mothers to deliver babies in hospitals, purchase more food, and reduce work hours around childbirth. However, while the life-saving impact is substantial, the program's cost-effectiveness is debated, with a cost per life saved of nearly $300,000. This figure is considerably higher than other proven health interventions like Vitamin A supplementation, suggesting cash grants are more effective at reducing poverty than as a primary life-saving tool.</p>

          <p>A Milan court has freed Manfredi Catella, founder of the prominent real estate firm Coima SGR, from house arrest without imposing alternative restrictions. Catella was detained in late July as part of a broader investigation into alleged crimes related to urban planning that fueled Milan's recent real estate boom. The inquiry, which also involves senior city officials including the mayor, was triggered by resident complaints about a surge in multi-story construction. Catella, who had temporarily stepped down as CEO, and all others under investigation have denied any wrongdoing in the case.</p>

          <p>An unverified photograph has emerged showing what appears to be a new, large stealth drone being tested by China. The image displays the aircraft from the rear with its landing gear down, featuring a low-observable, flying-wing design where the wings and fuselage are combined into a single flat structure. While details are scarce due to the photo's low resolution, the aircraft shows similarities to the Rainbow CH-7 stealth reconnaissance drone. The CH-7, developed by a state-owned aerospace corporation, was anticipated to conduct its first flight sometime this year.</p>

          <p>China's premier institute for engineering, the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has shortlisted a record number of executives and scientists from the private sector for membership this year. Nineteen candidates from leading technology companies like iFlyTek, CATL, and BYD are competing for the highly prestigious academician title, which has historically been dominated by individuals from state-backed institutions. This shift reflects a growing national recognition of the innovative capabilities within private enterprises. The CAE has indicated that eight of the approximately 100 new seats will be specifically reserved for leaders from the private tech industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. lawmakers are considering a proposal to allow more individuals to become 'accredited investors' by passing a knowledge test, granting them access to high-risk private market assets like venture capital and hedge funds. Currently, access is largely restricted by income and net worth thresholds. Experts say designing a fair and effective test is challenging, as it must gauge an investor's understanding of complex risks, including limited liquidity and subjective valuations. While the goal is to democratize investment opportunities, concerns remain about investor protection, especially when many struggle with basic financial literacy quizzes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new species of herbivorous dinosaur, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been named Istiorachis macaruthurae in honor of record-breaking sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. The name combines 'sail spine,' referring to the dinosaur's distinctive back structure, with a reference to MacArthur's surname. The 125-million-year-old fossil was initially discovered by a local fossil hunter and was recently identified as a new species by scientist Jeremy Lockwood. Dame Ellen MacArthur expressed her gratitude for the honor, noting the touching connection between the dinosaur's 'sail' and the sails that have defined much of her life.</p>
