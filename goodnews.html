          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from deporting Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence compromises U.S. foreign policy. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, temporarily halts the deportation, giving the government a chance to appeal. The judge emphasized that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, and his speech was being chilled, constituting irreparable harm. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on other alleged issues with his green card application.</p>
