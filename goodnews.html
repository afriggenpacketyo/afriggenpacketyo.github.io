          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his position among cycling's elite. Despite having a significant lead and facing treacherous, rain-slicked roads, Pogačar launched a bold attack during the final stage in Paris, a move characteristic of his aggressive racing style. Although he didn't win the final stage, which went to Belgian Wout van Aert, he finished safely, securing the overall victory by a margin of 4 minutes and 24 seconds over two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard. The 26-year-old's victory marks his continued dominance in the sport, adding to his impressive record in major cycling tours.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, receiving 99.7% of the vote. He was joined by dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and formidable reliever Billy Wagner in the 2025 class. Suzuki, known for his incredible contact hitting and 10 All-Star appearances, joked about the single writer who left him off the ballot, preventing a unanimous selection. Sabathia, a Cy Young winner and World Series champion, reflected on his career and the pivotal decision to join the New York Yankees, a move he initially resisted but came to see as his destiny.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 19:42:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, which is half of the previously threatened rate. The deal, announced after a meeting in Scotland between Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, aims to stabilize the €1.4 trillion transatlantic trade relationship. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and investing $600 billion in the American economy. While the deal averts a trade war, some sectors like steel will still face high tariffs, and the new baseline rate is higher than pre-Trump levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led and used the network, which boasted over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. Among those convicted was William Spearman, a lead administrator sentenced to life in prison, who was described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. Officials called the takedown one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory over teammate Lando Norris at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in their Formula 1 championship battle. The race turned on key moments, including Piastri's brave overtake on the first lap, mirroring a move Max Verstappen had used to win the sprint race a day earlier. Norris, starting on pole, made a small error at the restart which compromised his defense. Subsequent strategic choices, particularly regarding tire compounds during pit stops, placed Norris at a disadvantage, and despite a hard chase, he couldn't close the gap. The article analyzes the strategic calculus and minor errors that ultimately decided the outcome between the two McLaren drivers.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting positive earnings and raising its outlook, Honeywell's stock experienced a significant drop, a situation this article analyzes in depth. The piece explores potential reasons for the sell-off, including the complexities of its upcoming three-way corporate split, a lack of major exposure to the booming data center market, and general investor impatience. The author argues that the market's negative reaction is an overcorrection and presents a buying opportunity, citing the company's strong fundamentals and the long-term value expected from the breakup.

          <p>A lightning strike is being blamed for a second-alarm fire that caused extensive damage to a large home in Paradise Township, Pennsylvania, during a severe thunderstorm. Firefighters arrived to find the attached garage engulfed in flames, which grew rapidly after an explosion occurred within the structure. Crews faced numerous challenges, including the home's location on steep terrain with a long driveway, torrential rain, and the lack of nearby fire hydrants. Despite the intensity of the blaze, which caused the garage to collapse, firefighters successfully prevented the fire from destroying the main living area of the home, and no injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss transatlantic trade and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The talks are expected to focus on refining the recently announced US-UK trade deal, with Starmer likely pressing for lower tariffs on key imports like steel. On Gaza, Starmer will navigate a delicate diplomatic position, balancing the UK's alignment with European allies who are increasingly critical of Israel, and the staunchly pro-Israel stance of the US administration. The meeting underscores the close ties Starmer has sought to build with Trump, even amid clear foreign policy differences.</p>

          <p>Small blue lights are being installed on top of traffic signals in several Florida counties to help law enforcement identify drivers who run red lights. These "confirmation lights" illuminate simultaneously with the red light, allowing an officer positioned at any angle to verify if a driver has entered the intersection illegally. The system is designed to improve safety for officers and act as a deterrent to dangerous driving behavior. Studies from other states where these lights have been implemented have shown statistically significant reductions in crashes caused by running red lights, a major cause of traffic fatalities.</p>
