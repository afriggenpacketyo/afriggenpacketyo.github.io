          <p>Online lender Upgrade, founded by Renaud Laplanche, has raised $165 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $7.3 billion. This marks its first fundraising since 2021, as the company has been cash-flow positive for the last three years and has seen its annualized revenue surpass $1 billion. Upgrade has expanded from personal loans into a broader suite of financial services, including credit cards and BNPL offerings, competing with firms like SoFi and Affirm. Laplanche indicated the new capital will bolster the company's balance sheet and provide employee liquidity ahead of a potential IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced new default settings for teenage users, aiming to filter their content feeds to a level comparable to a "PG-13 movie." This move is part of a broader trend where digital media platforms are adopting content rating systems similar to television, addressing concerns about youth mental health and online safety. The article explores the complexities of online age verification, which is proving difficult to implement effectively and raises privacy and free speech concerns. While creating a safer internet for kids is a bipartisan goal, the strategy of segmenting the internet by age presents significant technical and civil liberties challenges.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is heading towards a televised debate featuring three distinct candidates: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, holds a significant lead in the polls with a progressive platform that includes free bus service and city-owned grocery stores. Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, is attempting a political comeback after resigning amid scandal, while Sliwa aims to capture votes from those wary of Mamdani's policies. The debate is a critical moment for the candidates to address key issues like the city's budget deficit and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>Following the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Germany has outlined its potential role in Gaza's future, focusing on humanitarian efforts and reconstruction. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged an initial €29 million for immediate aid and committed to a much larger, nine-figure sum for rebuilding, though he has ruled out sending German soldiers for any stabilization mission. Germany, alongside Egypt, is set to co-host a donor conference to raise funds for the estimated $53 billion reconstruction cost. The ceasefire has also reignited debate within Germany over the resumption of arms deliveries to Israel, which were partially halted during the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Uruguay Becomes First South American Nation to Legalize Euthanasia by Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 06:31:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so through legislative action, rather than a court ruling. The law permits a healthcare professional to assist in ending the life of a mentally competent adult suffering from an incurable illness that causes "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the region's most socially liberal nations, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The legislation was passed despite opposition from the Catholic Church, reflecting the country's strong secular traditions.</p>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to acclaimed Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after it was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." At the time, homosexual relationships were criminalized, and Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor, leading to the cancellation of his library privileges. The new card, intended to "acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering" he faced, was collected by his grandson, Merlin Holland, on what would have been Wilde's 171st birthday. Holland called the new card a "lovely gesture of forgiveness," celebrating the legacy of the author of works like "The Importance of Being Ernest."</p>

          <p>California is holding its annual ShakeOut earthquake drill, reminding residents of the importance of the "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" technique during a seismic event. Experts emphasize that this is the safest action, as studies from past quakes show that moving or running outside increases the risk of injury from falling debris. The article also provides other preparedness tips, such as securing heavy furniture, retrofitting older homes to prevent foundation collapse, and knowing if you are in a tsunami hazard zone. Officials stress that with 70% of Californians living near an active fault, preparation is crucial for mitigating the impact of the inevitable "Big One."</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to fast-track the study of psychedelic drugs for treating conditions like PTSD and depression, a move strongly supported by veterans' advocacy groups. The new law, AB 1103, streamlines the approval process within the state's Research Advisory Panel, allowing FDA-approved studies of Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin to proceed more quickly. Proponents, including former Navy SEAL Marcus Capone, argue that these therapies show immense promise for veterans suffering from wartime trauma, citing observational studies where participants saw significant reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms after treatment.</p>

          <p>The L.A. Found program, which provides free tracking devices to county residents with cognitive disabilities prone to wandering, has expanded its technology offerings. Participants can now choose between a radio-frequency wristband tracked by the Sheriff's Department or a new GPS-enabled smartwatch that pairs with a caregiver's app. The program was created seven years ago after Nancy Paulikas, who had early-onset Alzheimer's, went missing and was later found deceased. With up to 60% of people with dementia and 50% of autistic individuals at risk of wandering, the technology provides peace of mind for caregivers and helps ensure the safety and independence of their loved ones.</p>
