          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie was defeated by Novak Djokovic in the US Open, marking his seventh consecutive loss against the 24-time Grand Slam champion in a four-set match. Norrie acknowledged being "a little overconfident" after breaking serve early in the third set, but Djokovic, despite battling a lower back injury, recovered to win 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-3. This outcome concludes British singles participation at the season's final major, while Djokovic, the oldest man to reach the fourth round since 1991, advances in his quest for a record 25th major title. The article highlights Djokovic's enduring skill and Norrie's reflections on his improved season.</p>

          <p>All SkyWest Airlines flights were temporarily grounded for 21 minutes on Friday night, a measure implemented by the US Federal Aviation Administration at the airline's own request. The ground stop advisory, issued at 0149 GMT and canceled at 0210 GMT, affected the largest US regional airline, which operates flights for major carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines. Specific details regarding the reason for the grounding were not immediately disclosed by SkyWest. This brief but significant disruption caused temporary inconvenience for passengers and operational challenges across a broad segment of regional air travel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire U.S., citing significant due process concerns. This ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb pauses a January directive that would have applied expedited removal nationwide and to individuals who arrived in the past two years, rather than just border areas and recent arrivals. The decision is a major setback for the administration's mass deportation agenda, as the court found the expanded procedures violate migrants' constitutional rights by denying them a meaningful opportunity to challenge allegations. This ruling underscores the judiciary's role in safeguarding civil liberties against executive actions.</p>

They endured violent tropical storms, including an incident where Lachlan was swept overboard but secured by a safety line, ultimately surpassing the previous record of 162 days. Reunited with family in Cairns, Australia, the brothers also successfully raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, aiming for £1 million. This remarkable feat of human endurance and charitable effort highlights their resilience and strong familial bond throughout the challenging expedition.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic stretch of Angeles Crest Highway, also known as Highway 2, has reopened to the public just in time for Labor Day weekend, following years of closures due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures and collapsed pavement, with further destruction from the September 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, totaling approximately $7.9 million, included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and improved drainage systems. While the reopening provides increased access to popular hiking trails and may alleviate overcrowding, it coincides with the Angeles National Forest being at an extreme fire danger level, raising significant concerns about potential new blazes.</p>

Investment director Jian Shi Cortesi notes that while most major global stock markets are at historical highs, Chinese equities still have substantial room for growth, particularly in "undervalued innovation" sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, allowing them to continue living and working in the U.S. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling, finding that the Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. While the Department of Homeland Security condemned the decision as obstruction by "unelected activist" judges, the ruling reinforces Congress's intent for TPS to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics. This article highlights a significant legal victory for immigrant rights advocates, though the administration vows to pursue all legal options.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, has gone viral due to her animated responses and lawyers' unusual questions about her wigs and nails. Cardi B denies physically attacking Emani Ellis, claiming a verbal altercation occurred after Ellis allegedly invaded her privacy by filming her during a private pregnancy appointment. The security guard, however, claims the rapper cut her cheek with a fingernail, causing a "hyper-sensitive" scar that required medical treatment. The trial, expected to conclude next week, highlights the intersection of celebrity, legal proceedings, and social media spectacle, drawing significant public attention.</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, found that young children diagnosed with ADHD are often prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are attempted. The study examined nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children, revealing that about 68% received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Lead author Dr. Yair Bannett noted concerns about treatment failure due to side effects like irritability and aggressiveness, emphasizing the importance of starting with the lowest possible harm. This article highlights a significant issue in pediatric ADHD treatment, suggesting a need for closer adherence to clinical guidelines that prioritize behavioral strategies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is considering expediting the process to reinstate former service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth expected to address concerns at a listening session. While hundreds have applied, fewer than two dozen have been reinstated so far. The proposed change would grant honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal, excluding those with additional disciplinary infractions. This initiative follows President Trump's executive order to reinstate these troops, whom he called unfairly burdened. This article highlights ongoing efforts to address a polarizing issue within the military and provide redress for affected personnel.</p>
