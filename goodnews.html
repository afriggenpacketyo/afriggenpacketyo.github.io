          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have her 2022 fraud conviction reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court denied her request for a rehearing, and no judge requested a vote on a full court rehearing. This leaves the Supreme Court as her last option to undo her conviction for wire fraud related to defrauding investors in her blood-testing startup, Theranos, which shut down in 2018 after a Wall Street Journal story exposed its struggles. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs in early April. While specifics are still being finalized, the deal aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. Key provisions include maintaining a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusting tariffs on UK autos, creating new export opportunities for US farmers, and establishing commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment. The deal also requires the US to negotiate an alternative arrangement to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in swing districts are facing tough votes on legislation that would cut popular programs to finance President Trump‚Äôs agenda. Representative Gabe Evans, representing a swing district in Colorado, is involved in drafting legislation that could significantly impact Medicaid. The Republican budget resolution requires the Energy and Commerce Committee, where Evans sits, to slash spending by $880 billion over the next decade, largely through reductions to Medicaid, the government program providing health insurance for lower-income Americans. This creates a dilemma for Republicans who must balance supporting the president's agenda with the potential backlash from constituents who rely on these programs.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia has announced his candidacy for the Senate, challenging Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff in 2026. This announcement comes after Governor Brian Kemp decided not to run for the seat. Carter is positioning himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump and focusing on cultural issues, including transgender rights, to appeal to voters. He has also invested significantly in TV advertising to highlight his stance and criticize Ossoff's voting record, particularly on border security and transgender athletes. The race is expected to be competitive, as Georgia has shifted back to its Republican roots after Ossoff's 2021 victory.</p>

          <p>A young kangaroo named Hickory escaped from its owner's enclosure in Saint Cloud, Florida, leading to the owner facing charges for lacking the required permits. The kangaroo was seen hopping down a busy road before being captured by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission with the assistance of a licensed kangaroo facility owner. Hickory was tranquilized and taken to a wildlife preserve until the owner's enclosure complies with local codes. This incident follows a similar event in Alabama where a kangaroo shut down an interstate highway, highlighting the challenges and regulations surrounding exotic animal ownership.</p>

The rally was broad-based, with sectors like energy, industrials, banks, and consumer discretionary showing strong performance. Boeing shares rose following the U.K.'s agreement to purchase airplane parts, including a $10 billion Boeing procurement. Goldman Sachs also performed well, possibly due to investor anticipation of increased dealmaking activity as trade uncertainty diminishes. Goldman Sachs president John Waldron expressed optimism about a potential rebound in capital markets activity due to a strong backlog and pipeline for deals.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal affecting goods traded between the two countries, though President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports remain in place for most UK goods. Key aspects of the deal include cutting car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, scrapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and continuing negotiations on pharmaceuticals. The deal does not alter the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but the UK and US have agreed to work on a digital trade deal. This agreement is not a comprehensive trade deal, but a reversal or reduction of some tariffs on specific goods, with months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>

          <p>President Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a trade deal, the first since Trump's global tariffs last month, but questions remain about the specifics. The agreement maintains a 10% baseline tariff on U.K. imports while eliminating duties on British aluminum and steel and lowering tariffs on some U.K. car exports. In return, the U.K. will lower barriers for U.S. farmers and ranchers. While touted as a milestone, officials described the deal as just the start of future trade talks. Starmer emphasized the significance of tariff reductions but expressed hope for further negotiations to lower the 10% baseline rate.</p>
