          <p>Microsoft has committed to spending an additional $4 billion to construct a second data center in Wisconsin, following a $3.3 billion investment in its first facility slated to open in 2026. The initial center will be equipped with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's advanced Blackwell GB200 chips, designed to handle intensive artificial intelligence workloads. The company emphasized its commitment to sustainability, planning to match its energy consumption with carbon-free sources, including a new solar farm. This expansion reflects the massive industry-wide race to build infrastructure capable of meeting the surging demand for AI services.</p>

          <p>Uber Technologies is set to launch a drone food delivery service through a new partnership with autonomous aerial system company Flytrex. The service will be piloted in select U.S. markets for Uber Eats customers by the end of the year, marking the company's latest expansion into multimodal delivery methods beyond traditional vehicles. Uber also announced an investment in Flytrex to accelerate the technology's development and deployment. This move follows Uber's recent adoption of sidewalk delivery robots and comes as competitors like DoorDash also explore drone-based solutions to innovate the food delivery market.</p>

          <p>Israeli author and psychotherapist Ayelet Gundar-Goshen explores the role of writing as resistance in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. She describes initially feeling that creating fiction was a selfish act amid the suffering of hostages and Palestinians, but was spurred on when Israeli officials called for boycotting art that humanizes Palestinians. Gundar-Goshen believes literature can be a tool to confront reality and explore the psychological dynamics of fear and aggression that shape the conflict. While she participates in street protests, she asserts that words have power, especially if they can help people examine their own blind spots and foster empathy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has announced it secured £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. companies, a deal expected to create over 7,600 jobs. The announcement coincided with the signing of a "Tech Prosperity Deal" by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Donald Trump. As part of the agreement, major tech firms like Microsoft and Google have pledged billions for UK-based projects, including data center expansions and AI development. The deal aims to deepen economic ties, though it comes as some other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, have scaled back UK investments citing a challenging business environment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 10:03:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the UK's interest rate at 4%, citing persistent inflation that remains nearly double the bank's 2% target. Governor Andrew Bailey warned that the country is "not out of the woods yet," suggesting that any future rate cuts would need to be gradual and cautious. While the bank has cut rates five times since last year, recent data shows inflation ticking up again, driven partly by rising food costs. The bank also announced it would slow the pace at which it sells off government debt to minimize impact on financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two-time world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is returning to Tokyo, the site of her devastating injury at the last Olympics, but insists she does not see it as a redemption mission. Four years ago, her Olympic hopes were ended by a calf injury during the 200m event. Since then, she has recovered to win a second world title and an Olympic silver medal in Paris, completing a remarkable comeback. Johnson-Thompson stated that her journey is now a happy one, and she is excited to experience a full stadium in Japan, viewing her current competitions as "freebies" after overcoming significant career lows.</p>

          <p>A long-term study initiated in the early 2010s is providing new insights into the stability of gender identity among young children who undergo social transitions. At the time the research began, allowing young children to live as a different gender without medical intervention was still a controversial practice. The study followed a cohort of these children over many years to understand the trajectory of their identities. This research is contributing to the evolving understanding of childhood gender identity and informing the debate around the appropriate timing and nature of support for transgender youth.</p>

Speaking after the Fed's recent quarter-point reduction, Tepper cautioned that cutting rates too aggressively while inflation is not fully controlled could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles. He noted that while market valuations are high, he remains constructive on stocks in the short term because of the central bank's current easing stance, stating, "I'm not ever fighting this Fed."

          <p>Liverpool has developed a remarkable habit of securing victories in the final moments of matches this season, scoring late winners in all five of their competitive games so far. An analysis shows the average time of their winning goal is after the 91st minute, a stark contrast to the previous season's average of 70 minutes. Manager Arne Slot attributes this success to the team's mentality, fitness, and preparation, allowing them to push for a result until the very end. The trend is notable for the involvement of veteran players, with over half the late-goal contributions coming from those aged 32 or older.</p>
