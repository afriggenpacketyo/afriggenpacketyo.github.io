        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans struggle with medical debt due to high healthcare costs, high deductibles, and unexpected bills. The article outlines several strategies for relief, including negotiating directly with healthcare providers for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and using a medical bill advocate to identify errors. Additionally, debt consolidation or debt management programs can help manage medical debt alongside other debts, and debt settlement is presented as a last resort, despite potential credit score damage. Taking action early and exploring all available options are emphasized for achieving a positive outcome when dealing with medical debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, removing the threat of prosecution for ending their pregnancy. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks due to "desperate circumstances". While the new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, it aims to provide care and support rather than criminalization for women in difficult situations. Campaigners and abortion providers have welcomed the decision, while groups opposing abortion rights have expressed concerns.</p>

          <p>The NBA's plan to bring more parity to the league is working, even though television ratings are down. A new collective-bargaining agreement has made it more difficult for individual teams to load up with multiple superstars and keep championship-winning rosters together year after year. The rules explain why many experts think that Boston, which won the championship last year and seemed poised to establish yet another Celtics dynasty, will make significant changes to its roster this offseason. The NBA is also seeing a rise in international talent, and this has also pushed the league in the direction of parity.</p>
