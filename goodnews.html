        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains 'freshers' flu' as a common cluster of respiratory viruses that rapidly spreads among new university students. Factors such as close living quarters, compromised immune systems due to stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption contribute to its prevalence. Experts highlight the ease of viral transmission, even during incubation periods, and the possibility of multiple infections. Students are advised to seek medical attention for persistent symptoms and prioritize recovery despite academic pressures, as the body needs time to recuperate from significant viral assaults.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge, Rudolph Contreras, has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers after they turn 18. The ruling states that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order, which requires their release to the least restrictive setting if they pose no danger or flight risk. This decision comes amid concerns about the administration's alleged plans to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport and accusations of reviving family separation tactics. The article underscores ongoing legal battles over controversial immigration policies affecting minors.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on her third attempt, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi aims to revive his "Abenomics" economic vision and has held significant government roles. While known for conservative stances on issues like married women's maiden names, she has recently softened her tone, proposing policies to support women's health and childcare. Her political journey, inspired by a desire to strengthen Japan's global standing, reflects a determination to lead.</p>

He took over Portsmouth in 1999, leading them to a Championship title, and later achieved similar success with Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday.

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism and gratitude for President Trump's ceasefire proposal, which Hamas has accepted. Many attendees, some wearing Trump masks, credited the US President for potentially brokering a deal to return hostages, a task they believe Prime Minister Netanyahu failed to accomplish. Despite the hopeful mood, skepticism lingered regarding Netanyahu's commitment to the deal, with fears he might sabotage it for political gain. The rally underscored the deep public desire for the hostages' return and an end to the conflict, reflecting a collective yearning for normalcy.</p>

          <p>Billionaire businessman Andrej Babis' populist ANO party secured a victory in the Czech parliamentary elections, winning nearly 35% of the vote and 80 seats, though falling short of an overall majority. Babis, a former prime minister, is expected to lead talks to form a new coalition, potentially with two right-wing eurosceptic parties: the anti-Green Deal Motorists for Themselves and the anti-immigrant Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD). While ANO aligns with the Motorists on EU emissions targets, relations with the SPD may be strained due to Babis' firm opposition to referendums on EU or NATO membership and mass deportations of Ukrainian refugees.</p>

Amorim, currently under pressure, defended waiting four games to debut Lammens, citing adaptation needs and media scrutiny. The team secured a third consecutive home win, but Amorim acknowledged the lack of away momentum, emphasizing the need for consistent positive results in upcoming fixtures to secure his future.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and G7 nations are pressuring Turkey to reduce its significant reliance on Russian oil and gas, with Russia supplying over half of Turkey's oil imports and 41% of its natural gas last year. Turkey benefits from lower Russian energy prices due to EU sanctions, making a sudden shift challenging for its energy security. However, Turkey is pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms, alongside promoting domestic and renewable energy sources. This complex balancing act aims to improve relations with the US while navigating its substantial energy needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Piano sales have plummeted significantly since 1925, reflecting changing cultural trends and economic pressures, with fewer people able to afford or house acoustic pianos. However, the instrument is finding new life through digital pianos, which offer a more affordable and space-saving alternative. Piano technician Hannah Beckett notes that while millennials struggle with homeownership, digital options provide accurate sounds and notes for beginners. Experts are optimistic about a resurgence in piano playing, driven by a desire for musicality and emotional expression, as people become weary of screens and seek new forms of engagement. This shift marks an evolution in musical education.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen criticized Formula 1's driver-cooling system, declared mandatory for "heat hazard" races like the Singapore Grand Prix, stating he won't use it and opposes future mandatory use. He argued it should be a driver's choice, citing discomfort and design flaws in narrow cockpits. Verstappen highlighted issues like dry ice melting and making the system ineffective in high temperatures, potentially making drivers hotter. In contrast, George Russell confirmed he would use the system, noting Mercedes had made improvements to car cooling, underscoring differing driver preferences and the challenges of implementing safety measures in extreme racing conditions.</p>
