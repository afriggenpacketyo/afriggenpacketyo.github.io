          <p>Birmingham is preparing a public procession to allow fans to pay respects to heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at 76. The cortege will travel along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, a significant site for fans. The city's Lord Mayor emphasized the importance of a dignified tribute for Osbourne, calling him a "son of Birmingham." The event is family-funded, with a book of condolence and an exhibition also available for public remembrance.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prioritizing Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as potential striker acquisitions for the current transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to offload unwanted players to fund new arrivals, a process that might extend until the September 1 deadline. While Villa is reluctant to sell Watkins, United believes their stance could change, though they deem the suggested £60 million price tag too high. Newcastle is also interested in Sesko, indicating competitive interest for the Slovenian forward.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst estimates, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. Investment banking revenues surged 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion, boosted by market volatility following U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. This strong performance aligns with other major banks like Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase, which also reported higher trading revenues. Barclays continues to navigate a changing banking landscape, including potential U.S. capital rule changes and strategic shifts by competitors in the UK.</p>

          <p>Chinese experts are advocating for China to leverage its cultural symbols and foster engagement with Asian scholars to reshape its global narrative. This strategy aims to counterbalance the long-dominant Western discourse and proactively influence international rules in emerging fields. They suggest that Asia's values, rooted in harmony and diversity, should guide a return to consensus-based politics. As global power dynamics shift, with the US focusing domestically and emerging economies seeking more active roles, discourse power has become a key area of international competition for Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Belgian Grand Prix highlighted challenges for pole-sitters at Spa, where slipstreaming on long straights can negate qualifying advantages, as seen with Piastri and Norris. While pole doesn't guarantee a first-lap lead, track layout and car setups play a role, and changing the historic circuit is undesirable. Discussions arose about the FIA's conservative approach to wet race conditions, with drivers acknowledging the balance between safety concerns (especially after recent fatal junior race incidents at Spa) and allowing competitive racing. Lewis Hamilton's recent dip in form at Spa was attributed to new braking characteristics, a new data engineer, and a track limits misjudgment, rather than a sustained performance decline.</p>

          <p>India has surpassed China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. in the second quarter, reflecting a significant shift in global manufacturing supply chains. Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% last year, primarily driven by Apple's accelerated move to the country. This shift is influenced by heightened trade uncertainty between the U.S. and China, including past tariff threats. While India and Vietnam's share grew, manufacturing efficiency (yield rates) in these countries remains lower compared to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has launched its first nationwide subsidy aimed at boosting birth rates, offering parents 3,600 yuan ($500) annually for each child under three. This initiative, which will benefit around 20 million families, follows the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago and local government pilot programs. China's population has fallen for three consecutive years, and the country faces a rapidly aging demographic. The policy, applied retroactively, seeks to alleviate the high cost of raising children, which is among the world's most expensive in relative terms.</p>
