          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. is prepared to engage in diplomacy with Iran following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, while cautioning that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be "suicidal" for Iran. Rubio emphasized the U.S. mission aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not to attack the Iranian people or pursue regime change. He noted President Trump's preference for diplomacy and warned of consequences if Iran chooses a different path, reiterating the U.S. would defend its interests and allies in the Middle East. Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie added that the U.S. has plans to clear the strait if Iran attempts to mine it.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Iran, Israel, and the United States, the Iranian diaspora in Los Angeles is finding comfort in local Persian restaurants and neighborhoods like Tehrangeles. Restaurants like Azizam are offering safe spaces for Iranians to connect with their culture, providing tea and backgammon to ease anxiety. Many Iranian Americans express concerns for their families in Iran but also hope to bridge the divide between the two nations. While opinions on the Iranian regime vary, these community spaces offer a sense of unity and support during a time of uncertainty and fear.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely closed higher on Sunday, demonstrating resilience following the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Tel Aviv stocks reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would help resolve the conflict with Tehran. While Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, and Egypt's EGX30 showed significant growth. Analysts suggest the Gulf's diplomatic stance and calls for peaceful resolution have shielded it from major market impacts, with the removal of the Iranian threat potentially viewed positively by international investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is navigating a delicate diplomatic situation following the US airstrikes in Iran, as the UK seeks to maintain a strong relationship with the US while avoiding direct military involvement. Despite Starmer's calls for de-escalation, the US proceeded with the strikes, and the UK was not asked to participate in the operation. The UK government has acknowledged being given advanced warning of the US action, but it remains unclear why the UK was not invited to join, potentially due to legal debates within the government. The situation could lead to further difficult decisions for the prime minister in the coming weeks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a parenting expert, identifies five phrases that can hinder communication and cooperation with children, including "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." She suggests alternative phrases that foster respect, emotional safety, and a sense of involvement for children. By explaining decisions, giving children agency, validating their emotions, and inviting problem-solving, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels more natural. Raouda emphasizes the importance of seeing defiance as a call for connection and support rather than something to suppress.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced that Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be exempt from the alliance's 5% GDP defense spending target. Sanchez stated that a 5% expenditure would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain, and that the country could meet its NATO commitments with a 2.1% GDP investment. While respecting the decisions of other countries to increase their defense spending, Spain will maintain its current approach. At an estimated 1.28% of GDP, Spain had the lowest defense expenditure proportion in the alliance last year, but has agreed to meet NATO's current 2% target.</p>
