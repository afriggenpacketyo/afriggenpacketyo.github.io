          <p>Syria has signed an $800 million agreement with the United Arab Emirates' DP World to enhance its port infrastructure and logistical services. The deal, attended by Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, will focus on developing a multi-purpose terminal at the port of Tartous and establishing industrial and free trade zones. This development follows the recent termination of a U.S. sanctions program on Syria by President Donald Trump. The removal of these sanctions is expected to facilitate foreign investment and trade, aiding the reconstruction of Syria's war-torn economy.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic in-orbit refueling mission. According to space situational awareness provider COMSPOC, the satellites appeared "visually merged" for several days after conducting multiple rendezvous and proximity operations. This complex maneuver, an autonomous satellite servicing feat not yet achieved by the United States, was closely monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites. The successful operation would represent a significant advancement in China's space capabilities and its ability to maintain its orbital assets.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will take steps to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, aiming to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. While not confirming reports of direct grants, she guaranteed that new measures to lower the upfront cost would be revealed soon. The announcement coincides with a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. This policy move addresses the high cost of EVs, a major barrier to their adoption ahead of the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock, known as NWA 16788, is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking probe. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its sale is a highlight of a natural history-themed auction.</p>

Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank over 140 years ago. The discovery highlights the potential for new archaeological finds, and further investigation is underway to learn more about the wreck.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created a new method to produce sucrose, or white sugar, from methanol, which can be derived from captured carbon dioxide. This biotransformation process does not require growing sugar cane or beets, offering a potential solution to both environmental and food security challenges. The team's system uses enzymes to convert the simple alcohol into complex carbohydrates, including sucrose, fructose, and starch. This breakthrough in artificial food synthesis could contribute significantly to carbon neutrality goals by turning industrial waste and CO2 into valuable products.</p>
