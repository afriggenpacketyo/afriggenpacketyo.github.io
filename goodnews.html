          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to swear in Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for D.C. and sign executive orders in the Oval Office. Attention will be focused on any remarks the president makes regarding his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his administration's response to the ongoing situation with Harvard University. Vice President JD Vance is slated to speak at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, following Trump's hosting of cryptocurrency investors at his Virginia golf course, marking a significant intersection between politics and digital currency.

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares experienced a significant increase despite the company's reduced profit forecast, attributed to an anticipated $50 million impact from tariffs. The company adjusted its full-year earnings per share expectations to $9.50-$10.50, down from $10.40-$11.40, and lowered its operating margin forecast. While tariffs are expected to negatively impact profits, Abercrombie reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, with sales rising to $1.10 billion. The company plans to mitigate the impact of tariffs through vendor negotiations and diversification of its sourcing network (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income and assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while a $500,000 income increased it by 12%. This finding underscores the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, as the median cost of an emergency is approximately $2,000.

          <p>A feature by DW explores whether Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had genuine friendships or if he lived solely for music, a topic examined at the Mozart festival in W√ºrzburg. The article notes that Mozart's father cautioned him against false friends, and artistic director Evelyn Meining emphasizes that music was Mozart's primary form of expression and connection. While Mozart had many admirers and colleagues, the article questions the depth of his personal friendships, suggesting they were often built within a musical context. The piece also dispels myths about rivalries with composers like Salieri and highlights artistic friendships among performers at the Mozartfest.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized the Republican spending bill, asserting that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reducing wasteful government spending. In an upcoming interview, Musk expressed disappointment with the bill, stating that it increases the budget deficit rather than decreasing it. DOGE, which Musk heads, claims to have saved $170 billion in taxpayer money through various measures, including staff reductions and USAID cuts. Musk had previously been a frequent presence in the White House but has since pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies.</p>
