          <p>A Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, is bypassing American middlemen and establishing direct relationships with Chinese suppliers due to trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariffs. This shift involves navigating logistical challenges but aims for a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. Amid the trade war, tariffs are reshaping how goods are sourced and traded across borders. Therrien's company is adjusting its purchasing strategy to move more sourcing outside the U.S. to find direct players, highlighting the need for businesses to adapt to the changing global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala sparked controversy among South Asian fans after two first-time attendees, Shah Rukh Khan and Diljit Dosanjh, were perceived to be dismissed by Vogue livestream hosts. Some fans felt that the hosts were largely unaware of Khan's global fame, while Dosanjh was barely acknowledged before the camera cut away. This perceived lack of respect for the South Asian superstars, who have cultivated international followings, has led to disappointment and criticism online.
