          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell pledged to contribute $1,000 to "Trump accounts" for new children of his employees, matching the government's proposed contribution to savings plans for newborns. Other CEOs, including Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon, expressed support for the savings account plan, a provision in the Republican-backed budget bill. If enacted, the program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, with additional contributions allowed up to $5,000 annually. The initiative, aimed at providing a financial head start for newborns, is pending Senate approval, facing resistance from fiscally conservative Republicans (not investment advice).</p>

He reflected on his time in Congress since 2019, highlighting his work on tax cuts, border security, and defending innocent life. Green, an Army veteran, also oversaw the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas during his tenure as committee chairman, and his seat is expected to remain Republican.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is considering replacing Ange Postecoglou with Thomas Frank, the current manager of Brentford, after finishing 17th in the Premier League table. While Frank has spent significantly less on player transfers than Tottenham, he has achieved a points-per-game record that ranks him 29th among Premier League managers. Chris Sutton suggests that Frank will face much more pressure at Tottenham than he does at Brentford, because of the expectation and the manager has to handle that expectation. Frank has been described as the opposite of Postecoglou for his adaptability.</p>

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy called the knighthood a long-overdue recognition for rugby league's contribution to national life.
