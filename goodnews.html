          <p>Dame Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative MP who defected to Reform UK, has been elected as the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, marking a significant victory for her new party. Jenkyns, who previously worked at Greggs, secured a substantial win over the Conservative candidate, gaining control of a ¬£24 million annual budget and powers over skills, transport, and economic development in the region. This win represents a remarkable political comeback for Jenkyns, who lost her seat in the general election less than a year prior. Her victory speech emphasized a "new dawn in British politics" and Reform's commitment to restoring Britain to its "glorious past."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK candidate Sarah Pochin won the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a mere six votes, marking a significant win against the Labour Party, especially given the seat's previous Labour stronghold. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Nigel Farage celebrated the victory as evidence that Reform UK is now the primary opposition to the Labour government, while a Labour spokesperson acknowledged the difficulty of by-elections for governing parties, attributing the loss to voter frustration with the current state of the country after years of Conservative rule. The Conservative vote share collapsed, placing them a distant third in the race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is moving the majority of its iPhone production for the U.S. market from China to India, with Vietnam becoming a major hub for iPads and Apple Watches, according to CEO Tim Cook. This shift is a response to President Trump's tariffs, which could increase Apple's costs by an estimated $900 million this quarter. While China will remain the primary country of origin for products sold outside the U.S., this strategic move aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and align with the Trump administration's push for companies to manufacture more in America. Despite these changes, Apple reported a 5% increase in revenues for the first three months of the year.</p>

          <p>British oil giant Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, exceeding analyst expectations, and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program to be completed over the next three months. CEO Wael Sawan described the earnings as a "solid set of results," highlighting the company's strong performance and resilient balance sheet. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks for the company. Shell's results come as Big Oil profits decline from record highs in 2022, influenced by a weak outlook for oil markets, falling crude prices, and volatile trade policies.</p>

          <p>"Jeopardy!" host Ken Jennings, who famously competed against IBM's Watson in 2011, remains skeptical of current artificial intelligence, despite acknowledging its advancements. Jennings believes modern Large Language Models would easily outperform Watson at "Jeopardy!" but values the human element in creative fields. He expresses a preference for content created by human minds and suggests that while AI may replace some jobs, true artists and hyper-creatives will adapt and reinvent industries using AI. He also notes that AI does a good job of mimicking what has already been created but cannot create things that don't exist.</p>

          <p>Roche has partnered with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. Petrelintide is an amylin analog that mimics a hormone co-secreted with insulin to increase satiety, offering a different approach from prevalent GLP-1 obesity drugs. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s, with potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. The partnership will see the two companies developing petrelintide both as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388, with Zealand receiving upfront payments and potential milestone payments based on trial and sales success.</p>

          <p>University scientists have revealed that Liverpool fans celebrating their club's title-clinching win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield generated seismic activity, registering tremors on earthquake-detecting equipment.

While colonial rulers Britain began an Indian census in 1872 and counted all castes until 1931, independent India since 1951 only counted Dalits and Adivasis.</p>
