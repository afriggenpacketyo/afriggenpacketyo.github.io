          <p>President Trump lauded Saudi Arabia and its leaders after the White House announced a $600 billion investment commitment from the kingdom in U.S. deals. During an investment forum in Riyadh, Trump also declared the removal of all U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to provide them with an opportunity for growth. The agreements included a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, equipping Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting technology from numerous U.S. firms. Trump emphasized the strong U.S.-Saudi relationship and his commitment to boosting the American economy through foreign investment. Optimism surrounding the defense sales is tempered by the removal of sanctions against Syria.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia yielded agreements valued at $600 billion with the Saudi government and firms, though details provided by the White House were initially vague.

Trump emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Saudi relationship and his administration's focus on economic development, also announcing the lifting of sanctions on Syria. While touting the kingdom's rapid development, Trump expressed his wish for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, which faced silence from the Saudi audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market has rebounded to levels seen before President Trump's tariffs triggered a decline, with bond yields aligning with earlier figures and inflation showing a slower pace in April. However, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final tariff levels, making it difficult to determine the economy's trajectory. Many feel compelled to participate in the market despite lacking conviction, fearing missed opportunities if tariffs decrease and stocks rise. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer. Uncertainty continues to affect business investment and consumer spending, influencing market dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, estimated at 2.4%. This adjustment, which may change based on inflation, would be lower than the 2.5% boost seen in 2025 and the lowest since 2021. The COLA provides an annual inflation adjustment to Social Security beneficiaries, including retirees and disabled individuals. It is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.</p>

          <p>The PGA of America has reiterated its opposition to the proposed rollback of the golf ball, with its chief executive stating the organization is "vehemently against" the plans put forward by the sport's rule-makers. The R&A and USGA announced in late 2023 that all professionals will be required to use a modified golf ball from 2028. The PGA Tour has never supported the rollback plan, and equipment manufacturers have also been firm in their opposition to the proposals. The PGA of America is asking for a delay in the rollback so research numbers can be reassessed. Golf's various organizations held talks on the subject at the Players Championship in March.</p>

          <p>The California attorney general's office said it will seek a preliminary injunction in its case challenging President Trump's tariff policy. The move could result in a court order freezing import duties on worldwide products.

A hearing is scheduled for next week, and a decision could come as soon as mid-June. The attorney general's office also submitted an amicus brief supporting an effort by other states to halt the tariffs in the Court of International Trade.</p>

The bill, which now heads to the governor, aims to ensure Iowans can participate in the celebration of the nation's 250th birthday. Republican state Rep. Bill Gustoff referenced President Trump's proposal to have a yearlong national exposition on the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines. Democrats raised concerns about fire safety and harm to military veterans with PTSD. Iowa banned consumer sales of fireworks for decades, but in 2017, lawmakers allowed cities and counties to license firework sellers.</p>
