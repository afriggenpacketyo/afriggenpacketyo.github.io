          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the "most appropriate" governing framework for Japan after the crucial House of Councillors election in July. He described securing a majority for his ruling coalition as a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it would be difficult amidst voter concerns over inflation and economic uncertainty. A recent Kyodo News poll indicated that half of the respondents do not want the ruling camp to maintain its majority. The election will be the first national parliamentary vote since Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in the lower house.</p>

          <p>According to sources, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade on September 3rd to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The move comes as the U.S. has reportedly proposed a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping during the same month. If realized, it would mark the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Trump's return to the White House, with Russian President Vladimir Putin also expected to attend. Tensions remain between the two nations over trade and other issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill following a threatened rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concessions, such as limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants, have put them in a "better position" to pass the legislation. Rebel MPs had raised concerns that the original plans would harm vulnerable and disabled people. The changes appear to have placated most of the rebels, ensuring the bill's likely passage.</p>

The company has grown from a niche sports car maker to a global giant, but its future value, according to CEO Elon Musk, lies in autonomous driving and humanoid robots. However, the stock has struggled in 2025 due to sluggish EV sales, increased competition, and concerns over Musk's unpredictable behavior and political entanglements, which have been correlated with a decline in the brand's reputation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines dim cabin lights during takeoff and landing primarily as a critical safety precaution, not for passenger comfort or to save energy. According to a pilot and a flight attendant, this procedure allows passengers' and crew's eyes to pre-adjust to darkness. In the event of an emergency evacuation, especially one involving a power loss, this quick adaptation is crucial for seeing emergency floor path lighting and spotting potential hazards outside the aircraft. Takeoff and landing are statistically the most dangerous phases of a flight, making this a key preparedness measure.</p>
