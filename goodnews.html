          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 09:47:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time rail fares, significantly reducing costs for commuters. This move, which follows a pilot scheme, aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to trains, providing both financial relief and environmental benefits. For example, a journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow during peak hours will now be almost 50% cheaper. While the policy is expected to cost between £40m to £45m annually, officials hope an increase in passenger numbers will help offset the expense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing economic uncertainty and the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, financial experts are advising that short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer the most attractive returns. Six-month CDs are identified as a particular "sweet spot," providing savers with competitive interest rates without locking up funds for extended periods. While longer-term CDs have historically yielded more, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative for those looking to maximize returns. Experts also mention CD laddering as a viable strategy to balance high rates with liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amanda Goetz, a two-time startup founder, shares her journey from experiencing severe burnout and panic attacks to developing a strategy she calls "sustainable ambition." Rejecting the idea of "toxic grit" or constant hustle, she now intentionally schedules cycles of intense work followed by periods of proactive rest. Goetz argues that balance isn't about having everything at once, but about creating a rhythm in life that allows for reprioritization. By re-evaluating her focus every few weeks, she creates space for both professional achievement and personal well-being without waiting for her body to force a break.</p>

          <p>New real-world study data indicates that Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug, Wegovy, provides a significantly greater reduction in cardiovascular risks compared to its main rival, Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The findings suggest Wegovy users had a 57% lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death, offering a much-needed boost to the Danish pharmaceutical company. Novo Nordisk has recently faced challenges in the key U.S. market, including declining market share and uncertainty over tariffs, which has impacted its stock price. The positive trial results caused the company's shares to rise on Monday.</p>

          <p>The All England Club has stated it has no plans to alter the format of the Wimbledon mixed doubles competition. This decision comes despite the success of a revamped, star-studded mixed doubles event at the US Open, which featured top singles players like Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek and drew significant fan attention. While players praised the US Open's innovative approach, Wimbledon officials consider their traditional format a key part of the tournament's identity. The contrast highlights how Wimbledon lags behind other Grand Slams in expanding its pre-tournament events and fan engagement.</p>

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, which ceased operations in 2020, is moving forward with plans to restart by the end of the decade. This revival is driven by the massive and growing electricity demand from AI data centers being built by major technology companies. The plant's owner, NextEra Energy, is seeking a power purchase agreement to finance the highly capital-intensive project. Duane Arnold is the third mothballed U.S. nuclear reactor, following Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, to pursue a restart in response to this new industrial power demand.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California is missing a key opportunity in its transition to electric vehicles by not promoting daytime charging at workplaces. The author, a researcher at UC San Diego, explains that charging during the middle of the day is both the cheapest and cleanest option, as it utilizes abundant solar energy that often goes to waste. To shift behavior from the current norm of overnight charging, which relies more on natural gas, the article calls for stronger incentives, better electricity pricing structures that reflect generation costs, and an expansion of reliable workplace charging networks.</p>

Instead of prioritizing STEM fields, higher education should embrace a renaissance of liberal arts. A liberal education, focused on deep engagement with foundational texts and ideas through discussion, cultivates wisdom and attention in ways that are resistant to AI shortcuts. This approach, the author contends, is the best preparation for a future where humanity itself is a superpower.</p>

The piece reflects on how shared cultural tastes validate our identities and how a friend's rejection of something we love can feel like a personal rejection.</p>
