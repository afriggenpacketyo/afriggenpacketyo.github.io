          <p>ServiceNow is intensifying competition with Salesforce by launching a new AI-powered platform for customer relationship management (CRM). ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott aims to reinvent the CRM category by improving how companies order, fulfill, and service customer relationships, and the company's momentum is riding high after recent earnings. While Salesforce currently dominates the CRM market, ServiceNow is focusing on AI agents to improve call deflection rates in service-based call centers. To enhance its AI capabilities, ServiceNow is expanding its partnership with Nvidia to develop AI models for real-time workflow execution.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is maintaining its full-year sales forecast and will not raise prices due to tariffs, according to CFO Richard McPhail. The company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements allow it to maintain current pricing levels. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which plans to raise prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's Q1 earnings missed expectations, but sales beat estimates, with comparable sales improving throughout the quarter. The retailer is focusing on professional customers and has seen positive results from its spring Black Friday event.</p>

          <p>World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side series, aims to capitalize on the surge in women's football by offering faster, more dynamic matches and significant financial rewards for players.

W7F emphasizes a player-centric approach with a Player Advisory Council to shape player care, competition strategy, and long-term impact. The tournament offers a $5 million prize pool, with 40% of the prize money going directly to players and staff.</p>

          <p>Online weight-loss company Noom has begun offering smaller doses of compounded versions of Wegovy as the U.S. drugs regulator clamps down on mass production of copies of the in-demand medicine. Noom will offer its version of compounded semaglutide as part of a program personalized for patients, which it says will comply with changing U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. Noom offers its compounded semaglutide at a starting price of $149 for the first month, and analysts have said the telehealth companies must pivot to working with branded drugs in order to survive after WeightWatchers filed for bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>Lionel Messi's Inter Miami have been terrible lately, and his complaints to the referee only made their situation worse. In the immediate aftermath of Sunday‚Äôs game, Major League Soccer wishes those dynamics didn‚Äôt exist at all. Messi claimed referee Guido Gonzales Jr told him he was not aware of the backpass rule. MLS Wrap Up, the league-produced review show, mentioned the call in passing but never showed the incident on-screen. It is the chaos of the league that is its easiest and most enticing entry point, with referee controversy working just as well to drum up attention here as it does everywhere else in the world.</p>

The guidelines include a comprehensive review of studies analyzing the efficacy of various pain management methods. The guidelines also acknowledge inequalities in the history of treating pain, with Black patients and women historically receiving less attention to their pain.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT), citing concerns that the policy is unconstitutionally vague and intimidates teachers. The court found that the resolution lacked definitions and enforcement guidelines, leading to self-censorship among teachers. The ruling reverses a trial court's decision, with the appeals panel emphasizing the need for clear and specific guidelines. The lawsuit also addressed the board‚Äôs policy of notifying parents about issues related to a student‚Äôs gender identity, but the panel said that issue was no longer in play because state law prohibits such automatic notification policies.</p>
