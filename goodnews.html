          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released by the Taliban after being detained in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar before returning to the UK. While the Taliban cited violations of Afghan law for their detention, no specific reasons were ever disclosed. The release was secured following negotiations brokered by Qatar, with UK officials expressing gratitude for the diplomatic efforts involved.</p>

France, however, faces significant challenges with key players suspended or injured, including Manae Feleu and Lina Queyroi.

The 37-year-old veteran was honored with a lengthy standing ovation from the sell-out crowd before pitching 4⅓ innings in a game the Dodgers would go on to win against the San Francisco Giants. The victory also secured the Dodgers' 13th consecutive postseason berth. The evening served as a celebration of Kershaw's storied 18-year career, all spent with the Dodgers, marking a sentimental moment for the player and the fans.</p>

          <p>As the school year begins, parents are once again engaging with class WhatsApp groups, which have become a source of both utility and stress. While these chats can be helpful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, they are also criticized for fostering anxiety, competitive parenting, and spreading misinformation. Some parents choose to leave the groups to avoid the constant notifications and negative discussions, which can sometimes escalate to the point of requiring school intervention. The article highlights the digital-age dilemma of staying informed versus protecting one's mental space from online chatter.</p>

          <p>Defending world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is in third place and contending for a medal heading into the final two events of the heptathlon in Tokyo. After the long jump, she trails the American leader Anna Hall and second-place Taliyah Brooks. Johnson-Thompson expressed frustration over a marginally fouled long jump attempt that would have significantly improved her position but remains focused on the upcoming javelin and 800m events. The competition is tight, with several athletes, including Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, still within striking distance of the podium.</p>

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is actively testing various counter-drone systems to defend against incursions over sensitive military and national security facilities. At an event at Eglin Air Force Base, technologies ranging from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture targets with nets were demonstrated. The initiative addresses the growing threat posed by small unmanned aerial systems, with officials noting about 8,000 drones in U.S. airspace at any time and 350 incursions over military sites in 2024. The goal is to establish rapid response teams capable of neutralizing drone threats across the country within 24 hours.</p>

          <p>A landmark global treaty to protect marine biodiversity in international waters is set to become law after reaching the required 60-nation ratification threshold. The High Seas Treaty, two decades in the making, will enable the creation of marine protected areas in waters beyond national jurisdiction, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans. Environmental groups have hailed this as a monumental achievement, providing a crucial legal framework to combat overfishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change. The agreement aims to protect 30% of the high seas by 2030, a critical step for reversing damage to marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Recent threats of regulatory action against ABC have raised questions about the powers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Created in 1934, the FCC is an independent agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. While it holds significant authority over local broadcast stations, including the power to grant and, in theory, revoke licenses, it has limited jurisdiction over cable channels or online content. The FCC is led by five commissioners appointed by the president, with no more than three from the same political party, and is legally barred from engaging in censorship.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The reported agreement would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country. While Trump described the call as productive, official Chinese state media offered a more reserved confirmation, stating Beijing welcomes negotiations. A key point of contention remains the ownership and control of TikTok's powerful algorithm, which pushes content to its 170 million American users.</p>
