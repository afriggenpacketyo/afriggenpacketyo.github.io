          <p>China is accelerating its strategic effort to attract elite scientific minds from overseas as part of its upcoming 15th five-year plan. The recent high-profile appointment of former Harvard statistician Liu Jun at Tsinghua University highlights this trend, reflecting a broader national push to build up domestic talent and gain a competitive edge in science and technology. This initiative aims to create a "snowball effect" by bringing globally recognized academics back to China, though the country faces significant headwinds in this global competition for top-tier researchers. The article notes this is a key component of China's long-term development strategy.</p>

By generating demand, the alliance hopes to incentivize producers to invest in expensive decarbonization technologies and accelerate the transition to more sustainable building materials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is actively testing autonomous fighter drones, such as the XQ-58, designed to fly alongside and in coordination with human-piloted aircraft. This initiative, dubbed "Top Gun AI," aims to leverage artificial intelligence to process vast amounts of combat data and make real-time decisions, potentially revolutionizing aerial warfare. The development is seen as a strategic necessity to counter the growing capabilities of adversaries like China, though it raises complex questions about the role of humans in lethal decision-making.</p>

          <p>The massive electricity requirements of AI data centers are driving a significant resurgence in nuclear power, with public and market support for the energy source growing. This revival includes plans to restart decommissioned plants, like Michigan's Palisades facility, and to develop new technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs). Tech giants are increasingly investing in nuclear energy to power their operations, viewing it as a necessary solution to meet the unprecedented demand, though regulatory and cost challenges for widespread deployment remain.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common source of conflict for couples is not money or intimacy, but rather their tone of voice. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more weight in communication than the actual words spoken, often turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article offers practical advice for de-escalation, such as pausing to rephrase a harsh statement or calmly asking a partner to speak differently, thereby interrupting the cycle of defensiveness before it snowballs into a larger argument.</p>
