        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In conflict and refugee areas worldwide, such as Gaza, Ukraine, and Rohingya camps in Bangladesh, children are using play as a vital tool for emotional survival. Psychologists emphasize that activities like creating makeshift toys or playing traditional games help them process trauma, manage stress, and reclaim a sense of normalcy amid instability. Organizations like BRAC and Save the Children facilitate these activities, observing how play transforms withdrawn children, allowing them to express themselves and find joy despite harsh circumstances. This therapeutic power of play is a historical constant, providing resilience and a sense of belonging for young people affected by war and displacement.</p>

          <p>The fire brigade in Wiesbaden, Germany, was dispatched four times in a single day to investigate reported gas leaks that were ultimately caused by the potent odor of durian fruit. In one instance, the smell from the exotic fruit in an Asian supermarket was circulated by a shopping center's ventilation system, causing alarm among visitors. Later that evening, residents of an apartment building also reported a gas smell, only to discover a neighbor had brought home a durian. Fire officials confirmed no gas was detected in any of the incidents, highlighting the fruit's notoriously strong and deceptive aroma.</p>

          <p>As part of its 15th and largest-ever Arctic Ocean scientific expedition, China has successfully completed its first manned deep dive beneath the polar ice. The operation was also the world's first coordinated mission involving both crewed and uncrewed submersibles in the polar region. A fleet including the icebreakers Xue Long 2 and Jidi supported the Jiaolong manned submersible. Researchers utilized this advanced capability to collect hundreds of deep-sea samples and gather extensive data on biodiversity, ocean conditions, and water chemistry, advancing China's scientific presence and understanding of the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, two Oklahoma-based friends, have gained a massive following with their podcast "I've Had It," offering a profanity-laced and comedic liberal counterpoint to the right-wing media ecosystem. Initially an entertainment show, the podcast quickly pivoted to politics, attracting high-profile Democratic guests like Barack Obama and Kamala Harris while building a community of several million followers. The hosts are known for their unfiltered commentary and aggressive political stance, arguing that the left needs to be more assertive in its messaging to counter Republican tactics. Their success suggests a growing appetite for authentic, unapologetic voices on the progressive side of new media.</p>

Barrett addressed public misperceptions about the Court's political nature, asserting that her decisions, including those related to Donald Trump, are based on the institution of the presidency, not the individual. She described herself as a "Steel Magnolia," possessing both traditional femininity and inner grit.</p>

          <p>Elvira Alvarado, a 70-year-old Colombian marine biologist, is pioneering the use of in-vitro fertilization to save the country's endangered coral reefs. For nearly five decades, she has witnessed the devastating effects of pollution and rising ocean temperatures, which have killed over half of the Caribbean's coral. Her team collects coral eggs and sperm during the brief annual spawning event, fertilizes them in a lab, and transplants the resulting hatchlings to regenerate damaged reefs. By selecting genetic material from more resilient corals, Alvarado hopes to build reefs that can withstand future climate change, inspiring a new generation of scientists in the process.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in popularity of seemingly random items like Labubu toys and Dubai chocolate is being driven by social media algorithms rather than traditional cultural tastemakers. Unlike past fads such as Beanie Babies, which had traceable origins in marketing and new e-commerce platforms, today's trends often lack clear context or cultural connection. Experts note that platforms like TikTok reward highly stimulating, colorful, and visually appealing content, which often leads to the infantilization of consumer trends. This phenomenon reflects a desire for shared, tangible experiences to bridge the gap between online and offline lives, creating a form of consensus reality in a fragmented digital world.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from that of a niche environmental group to a more combative "eco-populist" force. Polanski has promised to "pick fights" to gain attention, a bold approach the party hopes will resonate with disillusioned voters and capitalize on its recent membership surge to over 82,000. While this aims to build on the party's best-ever general election result, some members worry it could alienate the rural voters who were key to past successes. The party is now recalibrating its electoral targets, aiming to turn its growing momentum into a more significant political presence.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership approach, acknowledging a potential "price to pay" in opinion polls but insisting her patient strategy will "pay off eventually." Speaking at her party's conference, she contrasted her methodical policymaking with what she called "rushed" and ill-conceived announcements from the Labour and Reform UK parties. Badenoch is facing pressure over the party's poor electoral performance and the defection of support to Nigel Farage's Reform. She maintained that "doing politics differently means being patient and taking our time to get it right," arguing that winning without a solid plan is what led to past political troubles.</p>

          <p>The prominent medical publisher BMJ Group has retracted a controversial 2024 study that claimed daily doses of apple cider vinegar could lead to dramatic weight loss. The retraction cited "concerns raised about the quality of the work," which had reported that participants lost about 9% of their body mass in 12 weeks, a result many nutrition experts deemed implausible. This development is the latest blow to the credibility of apple cider vinegar as a health remedy, a belief popularized by celebrities and influencers but long questioned by the scientific community. The incident also highlights systemic issues in academic publishing, as the journal took over a year to act on initial concerns.</p>

At a recent conference on speculative fiction in Suzhou, authors expressed mixed feelings about AI's capabilities. Some find it useful, while others, particularly emerging writers, are experiencing a "psychological shock" as AI's output begins to approach human-level quality. The discussion also highlighted a growing call for stronger copyright protections to address the challenges posed by AI in the literary field.</p>

          <p>A pirate flag from the popular Japanese anime series "One Piece" has become a unifying symbol for Gen Z-led protests across the globe, from Nepal and Indonesia to Madagascar and Morocco. The flag, featuring a skull and crossbones in a straw hat, represents the show's protagonists, a group of rebels fighting an oppressive world government. Young protesters who feel unheard by their own governments identify with the anime's core themes of freedom, justice, and challenging corrupt authority. This adoption of a pop culture icon serves as a powerful, non-verbal signal of solidarity among different youth movements fighting for local causes under a shared global narrative.</p>

The author praises how Raquel's story explores Mexican American heritage and intergenerational legacy, continuing Samantha's theme of compassion. However, the article criticizes Mattel for making Raquel physically resemble a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa, thereby failing to represent the diverse appearances within the Latino community. The piece also argues that Maritza's own story missed an opportunity to more deeply explore the plight of Dreamers, urging American Girl to continue telling bold stories of underrepresented girls.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has been transformed from a relegation-battling club with subpar facilities into a Champions League contender and domestic cup winner. While not the instant spending spree many predicted, the club has seen significant investment in its squad, training ground, and off-field operations, with revenue expected to triple. The club's growth has been tempered by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, forcing a more gradual build than that of previous disruptors like Manchester City. The ownership continues to face criticism from human rights groups who accuse Saudi Arabia of sportswashing its human rights record. (not investment advice)</p>
