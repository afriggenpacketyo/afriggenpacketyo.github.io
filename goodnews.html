          <h2>Chinese EV Battery Giant CATL Pursues Major Global Expansion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its international operations. Following a major IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new factories in Europe, including a significant plant in Hungary, to complement its existing German facility. Driven by intense price wars and market saturation in China, CATL also plans to introduce its battery-swapping technology to the European market. This move could address key EV adoption barriers like charging speed and battery longevity, though it faces challenges related to infrastructure costs and lack of standardization among automakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of sports stars and entertainers, including Mike Tyson and Kevin Durant, has sent a letter to the White House urging President Trump to implement significant cannabis reform. The group's requests focus on three main areas: granting clemency for individuals with nonviolent federal marijuana offenses, reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, and ending discriminatory banking practices against legal cannabis businesses. The letter argues that current policies are outdated, economically harmful, and create unfair barriers for an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of Americans. It highlights the need for federal law to align with the growing number of states where cannabis is legal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election in July, Japan's government has formally requested that major social media operators take stronger measures to counter disinformation and defamation targeting political candidates. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked nine platforms, including X and Line, to clarify their processes for removing harmful content and to act on such requests more quickly. The move reflects growing concern among both ruling and opposition parties about the impact of false information on fair elections. However, Japanese lawmakers have yet to agree on how strictly to regulate online content while balancing constitutional guarantees of free speech.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Lorde kicked off the 2025 Glastonbury Festival with a surprise performance on the Woodsies stage, drawing a massive crowd that led to the area being temporarily closed due to overcrowding. The New Zealand artist's unannounced appearance coincided with the midnight release of her fourth album, "Virgin," which she promised to play in its entirety. This marks a significant return for the singer, who previously played the festival's main stage in 2022. The set included raw and emotional performances of new songs, reflecting the candid nature of her new record which explores personal struggles and identity.</p>

          <p>Argentinian midfielder Enzo Fern√°ndez is demonstrating remarkable form for Chelsea as he prepares to face his former club, Benfica, in the Club World Cup. After a challenging start following his record-breaking ¬£106.7 million transfer, Fern√°ndez has flourished under manager Enzo Maresca, who has pushed him into a more advanced, attacking role. The 24-year-old has become a key player, leading the team in goal involvements in 2025 and showing leadership on the pitch. His transformation from a deep-lying playmaker into a box-crashing midfielder has been pivotal to Chelsea's recent successes, silencing earlier doubts about his performance and high price tag.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Coldwell Banker reveals a split in the luxury real estate market, driven by economic uncertainty and high interest rates. The ultra-wealthy, those worth over $30 million, are increasingly making all-cash purchases and are less deterred by market volatility. In contrast, the merely affluent are more sensitive to borrowing costs and are proceeding with more caution. The report, based on a survey of luxury property agents, notes that while over half of agents have seen a rise in cash deals, overall luxury home sales dipped in May. Buyers at all luxury price points have also become more discerning, demanding high-end amenities and move-in ready conditions.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon draw has produced an all-British first-round match between Emma Raducanu and 17-year-old wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, the British number one, narrowly missed being seeded and faces a challenging path that could see her play 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in the second round and world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third. The draw features 23 British players in the singles events, the most since 1984. Britain's top male player, Jack Draper, also faces a difficult route, with a potential quarter-final matchup against seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have officially confirmed an agreement on a framework for a trade deal aimed at de-escalating economic tensions. According to statements from both nations, the framework involves China reviewing export applications for controlled rare earth minerals while the U.S. cancels a range of restrictive measures. This development formalizes an understanding reached in earlier talks and seeks to stabilize a fraught relationship that had seen both sides threaten major tariff hikes. The deal also addresses other key issues, including China's efforts to curb the flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant pressure from health experts, advocacy organizations, and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has reversed its decision to freeze federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The CDC notified the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health that its nearly $20 million in funding has been restored for the current year. Critics had warned that the proposed cuts were reckless and would lead to a dangerous spike in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. While the immediate funding is secure, advocates remain concerned as the President's budget for the next fiscal year proposes to eliminate this funding entirely.</p>
