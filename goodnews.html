          <p>Bernie Sanders critiques the Democratic Party for lacking a strong progressive message and failing to address the needs of working-class Americans effectively. He argues that the party's message of tinkering around the edges does not resonate with working people, emphasizing the need to confront the billionaire class and advocate for policies like healthcare for all and tuition-free public colleges. Sanders highlights the importance of Democrats presenting a clear alternative to Trump's economic policies and authoritarian tendencies, focusing on issues such as income inequality and access to essential services. His remarks underscore a call for a more assertive and progressive agenda within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has successfully entered a 3:1 Earth-moon resonant orbit, a fuel-efficient path considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure. However, claims that it is the first spacecraft to achieve this feat have been challenged by US and Canadian experts, who point to NASA's IBEX probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory in China asserts that Tiandu-1's flight data will support advancements in orbit maintenance, control, and autonomous navigation in complex gravitational environments. This accomplishment highlights China's growing capabilities in space exploration.</p>

          <p>At Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, staff members avoid naming or having direct contact with rescued seals to minimize emotional attachment. The center rescues injured or weakened seals and releases them back into the wild after recovery, aiding over 200 seals since its establishment. Despite efforts to maintain distance, staff often develop bonds with the animals, highlighting the challenges of wildlife rehabilitation. The center's work is crucial as seal populations face habitat loss due to global warming, making their protection increasingly important.</p>

These actions align with Beijing's directive for tighter control over strategic mineral exports, reinforcing China's dominance in the global supply of rare earth elements.

The article references research that defends the "China shock" claim, including a series of papers by economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson.

          <h2>CrowdStrike Price Target Raised After Post-Earnings Selling</h2>

          <p>Following CrowdStrike's quarterly earnings report, which showed beats on key metrics but mixed guidance, analysts are raising the price target despite some profit-taking. The company's revenue increased 20% year-over-year, with growth across major regions, and adjusted earnings per share exceeded estimates. The company's Falcon Flex subscription model is driving platform adoption, and cybersecurity is viewed as a critical expense for corporations. The price target has been raised to $500 per share, reflecting confidence in the company's future growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>
