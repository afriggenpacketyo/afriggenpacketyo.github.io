          <p>President Trump has nominated Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to lead U.S. Central Command, replacing Gen. Michael Kurilla, and Lt. Gen. Dagvin Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command, succeeding Gen. Michael Langley. Cooper, who previously led naval forces for CENTCOM, oversaw strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen and helped build a humanitarian pier off Gaza. Trump aims to restore stability in the Middle East, but challenges persist with the ongoing Gaza conflict and stalled nuclear deal negotiations with Iran. Cooper led 100 strikes in Houthi-controlled portions of Yemen while he was 5th Fleet commander, destroying the group's drone and missile capabilities that the Houthis used to harass commercial ships in the Red Sea. Optimism is tempered by the complexities of the region.</p>

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined sharply over the past decade, particularly among Republicans, with many questioning the value of a four-year college degree. Recent graduates are facing challenges in finding jobs, with unemployment rates at their highest since July 2021. The earnings gap between college graduates and high-school graduates has remained consistent since 2010. While a college degree still offers a wage premium, its relative value for lower-income students has declined, partly due to unequal access to high-demand fields and investment disparities in public universities.</p>
