          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and is now considered cancer-free following treatment. His medical team confirmed that the tumor was high-grade, necessitating the removal of his bladder and the creation of a new one from his intestines. Sanders, who kept his diagnosis private from his team, expressed his gratitude and stressed the importance of health checkups. He affirmed his intention to continue coaching and shared his experience to encourage others to be proactive about their health.</p>

          <p>California State Parks has launched a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of its most popular campgrounds: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change addresses years of frustration from campers who saw reservations vanish within minutes of becoming available. The system, which is free to enter, aims to level the playing field by giving more people a fair chance to book a spot. Unsuccessful applicants will receive points to increase their odds in future drawings, a model based on a successful pilot program.</p>

          <p>A massive artificial intelligence data center is set to be built near Cheyenne, Wyoming, with a projected electricity usage greater than all homes in the state combined. The project, a joint venture between Tallgrass and Crusoe, will start at 1.8 gigawatts and could expand to 10 gigawatts, supported by its own dedicated energy sources. While praised by officials for its economic benefits, the project highlights the enormous energy demands of the growing AI industry. The facility's scale has fueled speculation about its potential connection to OpenAI's large-scale data center initiatives.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a new trade deal, narrowly avoiding the imposition of steeper tariffs threatened by President Trump. The agreement sets a new tariff rate of 15% on many EU imports, down from the proposed 30%, and includes a European commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years. While some products like aircraft will be tariff-free, negotiations are ongoing for others, such as wine. The deal comes as the administration continues trade talks with other partners, including China, ahead of looming deadlines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a significant July slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire an outfielder who can provide a defensive upgrade before the trade deadline. While the team's superstar-laden offense has struggled, a primary concern is bolstering run prevention to support a potentially dominant playoff pitching staff. Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins has emerged as a prime target, valued for his elite defense and solid offensive production. The move would aim to improve the team's overall defensive alignment as they prepare for a postseason run where pitching and defense could be key.</p>

          <p>The landmark lawsuit by Hulk Hogan that led to the bankruptcy of Gawker Media has left a lasting legacy on media law and privacy rights in the digital age. The 2016 case, in which Hogan was awarded $140 million for the publication of a private sex tape, served as a powerful reminder of the limits of First Amendment protections. Legal experts note that while the case didn't set new precedent, it culturally redefined the line between newsworthiness and invasion of privacy. It affirmed that even for public figures, the graphic depiction of private acts is not protected, influencing how media outlets handle sensitive content.</p>
