          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $100,000 annuity purchased at age 65, noting that while it won't replace a full salary, it can provide meaningful supplemental income in retirement. Factors such as gender, interest rate environment, type of annuity, payout structure, and health status can impact the monthly payment. Currently, a 65-year-old man can expect around $652 per month, while a woman can expect about $627, and a joint life annuity pays approximately $570. Locking in an annuity now, while interest rates are relatively high, could be advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Lisa Murkowski's memoir, "Far From Home," discusses her journey as a consensus-building senator grounded in her Alaskan roots. Murkowski reflects on her 2010 write-in campaign victory and how it shaped her approach to serving in an increasingly partisan Washington. She emphasizes the importance of prioritizing qualifications over party affiliation and shares her experiences navigating tough political decisions. Murkowski hopes her story will inspire others to get involved in their communities and work towards solving problems.</p>
