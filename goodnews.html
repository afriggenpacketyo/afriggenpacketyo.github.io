          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's command of the Chinese military is being questioned due to an ongoing purge of top military officials, including leaders of the Rocket Force. The dismissals raise concerns about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war, especially concerning Taiwan. Despite China's military advancements, the lack of battlefield experience among officers and political interference remain significant issues, offering Taiwan and the United States time to strengthen their defenses and avoid miscalculation.</p>
