          <p>Shaun Murphy defeated Anthony McGill 10-7 in a thrilling final to claim his first British Open snooker title. The 2005 world champion delivered eight breaks of 50-plus, overcoming a strong challenge from Scotland's McGill, who was playing in his first final in eight years. Murphy didn't take the lead until the evening session and, despite McGill's resilience in briefly regaining it, won four consecutive frames to secure his first ranking title in over two years. This victory marks a significant achievement for Murphy, earning him £100,000 in prize money, while McGill collected £45,000.</p>

          <p>California's first gubernatorial debate for the 2026 race highlighted broad agreement among Democratic candidates on issues like opposing President Trump, making the state more affordable, and safeguarding immigrants with healthcare benefits. The forum, featuring candidates like Katie Porter and Xavier Becerra, saw them largely differentiate themselves on the margins, with a focus on their immigrant backgrounds and appeals to Latino voters. Notable divergences emerged on criminal justice reform, specifically Proposition 36, and support for a single-payer healthcare system. The debate also underscored the critical need for building more housing and streamlining permitting processes, reflecting key concerns for Californians.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new Labour Party proposals requiring migrants to prove their contribution to society to earn indefinite leave to remain. The plan includes migrants learning English to a high standard, maintaining a clean criminal record, and volunteering in their community. Labour aims to double the qualification period from five to ten years, distinguishing its approach from Reform UK's more radical proposals. This policy emphasizes integration and contribution, reflecting Labour's focus on fair migration and secure borders, while Mahmood also plans a "winter of action" to tackle shoplifting, drawing on her personal experiences.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom's massive spending on data center infrastructure is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble. He argues that today's investments are driven by established, cash-rich hyperscalers like Microsoft and Meta, unlike the debt-fueled, speculative ventures of 2000. While acknowledging current AI applications might seem limited, Cramer believes in its future potential, citing high demand for AI services and the strategic necessity for major tech companies to invest. He dismisses bubble comparisons by highlighting the current industry's strong financial backing and the genuine utility of AI as a necessity rather than a speculative gamble.

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, will announce a new Labour Party scheme guaranteeing paid work placements for young people unemployed or out of education for 18 months. This initiative aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, building on a previous "youth guarantee" for 18-21 year olds. Participants who refuse placements without reasonable excuse will face benefits sanctions, reinforcing a society founded on "contribution." The scheme, funded from existing budgets, will collaborate with private companies to help young people gain skills for full-time employment, addressing the nearly one million 16-24 year olds currently not in education, employment, or training.</p>

          <p>Asian economies should closely monitor the 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) due to their substantial and growing trade and investment flows to North America. In the past five years, Asian exports to USMCA partners grew by nearly 35%, reaching $1.7 trillion in 2024, with foreign direct investment exceeding $33 billion. Notably, FDI from Asia to Mexico has more than tripled since 2019, driven by desires to leverage USMCA tariff preferences, access the Mexican market, and diversify trading partners. Asian nations are encouraged to participate in public consultations to shape the debate and advance their interests. (not investment advice)</p>

While the reason for Amiry's "wrongful detention" remains unclear, the article notes previous prisoner swaps, including Ryan Corbett for a Taliban figure. Efforts continue to secure the release of other Americans still "unjustly detained" in the country.</p>

Suspect Glenroy Miller of the Bahamas was arrested and charged with armed kidnapping, willful injury, domestic abuse assault, and obstruction of emergency communications.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence that the U.S. has "successfully separated" TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, ensuring data security and preventing its use as a foreign propaganda tool. This follows President Trump's executive order approving a proposal for TikTok to continue U.S. operations under a new joint-venture company, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. American investors like Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX are expected to own over 80% of the new entity. Despite Vance's optimism, ByteDance has not yet acknowledged the executive order or confirmed the transaction. (not investment advice)</p>
