          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell saw its stock rise after reporting third-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance. The positive results were driven by a significant rebound in its aerospace segment and a record backlog of $39.1 billion, indicating strong future demand. The report comes ahead of Honeywell's planned spinoff of its Solstice Advanced Materials business, the first step in a larger plan to split into three separate, more focused companies. Management's optimistic outlook suggests sustained momentum for the remainder of the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to acquire equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story suggesting such talks were underway, similar to recent government investments in the semiconductor and rare earth industries. The administration has previously argued for taking stakes in companies receiving federal funds in sectors vital to national security. Quantum computing is considered a critical emerging technology with significant military and economic implications, attracting billions in investment despite not yet generating substantial revenue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at making IRS "math error" notices more understandable for taxpayers is now headed to the president's desk after unanimously passing the Senate. These notices are sent when the agency identifies simple clerical or mathematical mistakes on a tax return, but have been criticized for being unclear about the issue and the 60-day response deadline. The legislation, co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy, is intended to help taxpayers correct honest mistakes without needing professional assistance. The change comes as advocates express concern over IRS staffing cuts and their potential impact on taxpayer services.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion and interest rates remaining high, many borrowers are exploring debt forgiveness options. This article outlines several strategies for individuals facing financial hardship to manage or reduce what they owe. These methods include working with a professional debt relief company to negotiate a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors, a process that can significantly reduce the principal balance. Other approaches involve contacting credit card issuers directly to enroll in hardship programs or engaging a credit counseling agency to create a more manageable debt management plan.</p>

          <p>Known for decades as a discount carrier, Southwest Airlines is making significant changes to its business model to attract premium travelers. The airline will introduce assigned seating and eliminate its long-standing open boarding policy, allowing passengers to pay for upgrades and extra legroom for the first time. These changes, along with plans for new cabins, larger overhead bins, and improved Wi-Fi, represent a strategic pivot to compete more directly with other major carriers. The move follows the recent introduction of fees for checked bags, signaling a fundamental shift away from its traditional low-cost, no-frills identity.</p>

          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering surged after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline for the third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. The improvement was largely driven by its flagship brand, Gucci, where a 14% drop in sales marked a significant recovery from the 25% plunge seen in the previous quarter. This positive momentum has built investor optimism that the new management's strategies to revitalize the iconic brand are beginning to take effect. The results follow Kering's recent decision to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal to reduce debt and focus on its core fashion houses (not investment advice).</p>

Investors are closely watching for updates on cost-cutting measures, quality improvements, and the financial impact of tariffs and supply chain disruptions. Ford's performance will be compared to rival General Motors, which recently lowered its projected tariff impact for the year (not investment advice).</p>
