          <p>South Korea has halted its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, a move initiated by the new liberal government to foster trust and promote peace. The broadcasts, which included K-pop songs and messages critical of the North Korean regime, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign involving trash-laden balloons sent into South Korean territory. President Lee Jae-myung aims to reduce military tensions and alleviate the concerns of South Korean residents living near the border. While North Korea has yet to comment, the move signals a potential shift in inter-Korean relations. </p>
