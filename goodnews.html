His arrival at the Emirates Stadium is intended to provide experienced competition for current first-choice keeper David Raya. Kepa brings a wealth of experience, having won multiple major trophies with both Chelsea and on loan at Real Madrid.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Recent U.S. Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Price Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet led to significant spikes in U.S. consumer prices. Economists attribute this stability to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including aggressively pre-ordering inventory, absorbing initial cost increases to protect market share, and utilizing legal loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Experts caution, however, that these are temporary measures and that the inflationary impact of the tariffs is still likely to be felt in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NYU business professor and CEO advises job applicants to ask a specific, disarming question to gain true insight into a company's culture: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" The article argues that this question bypasses rehearsed, platitudinous answers about values and forces hiring managers to provide more honest and revealing responses. By understanding who wouldn't fit in, candidates can better assess whether the company's actual work environment aligns with their own personal values, leading to better career choices and greater job satisfaction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core," using it as a lens to explore the growing mainstream acceptance and literary exploration of kink. It traces the genre's evolution from a taboo subject to an established category where nonfiction often aims to demystify BDSM, while fiction delves into its complex psychology. Newell's book, set within San Francisco's sex industry, is lauded for its intelligent and emotionally perceptive examination of identity, loneliness, and the ambiguous space between performance and reality in transactional relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third consecutive quarter, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating a sustained trend of corporate treasury adoption. This shift is fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment and the success of pioneers like MicroStrategy, whose playbook more companies are emulating to boost shareholder value. In the second quarter, public firms added about 131,000 BTC, an 18% increase, compared to an 8% increase for ETFs, representing a distinct form of institutional investment in the cryptocurrency.
