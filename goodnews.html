          <p>New research confirms the real-world success of landmark 2015 medical advice that recommended introducing peanut products to infants as early as four months old. The study, published in Pediatrics, analyzed health records and found this guidance has prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing life-threatening peanut allergies. This marks a significant public health achievement, reversing decades of previous advice that had called for delaying the introduction of potential allergens. The findings provide strong evidence that early exposure is an effective preventative strategy.</p>

Other regional indices, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300, also saw gains as investors processed the latest economic data from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to introduce new vocational courses called V-levels for students in England aged 16 and over. These qualifications are intended to replace Level 3 BTECs and simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of technical education options. The proposal also includes creating an alternative qualification for the many teenagers who are required to resit their GCSE exams in maths and English, aiming to end a "demoralising roundabout" of failure for some students.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his strategic adaptability in a decisive 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite being without star receiver Puka Nacua. McVay pivoted from his team's usual offensive formations, which heavily favor three wide receivers, to a scheme utilizing three tight ends. This unexpected tactical shift proved highly effective, enabling quarterback Matthew Stafford to throw for five touchdowns with under 200 passing yards, demonstrating McVay's ability to innovate and overcome personnel challenges.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology company Akeso has presented promising trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, at a major European medical symposium. The results, also published in The Lancet, indicate the drug has a significant advantage with lower toxicity and no patient discontinuations during the trial. This positions the drug as a potentially leading asset in its class, leading to a temporary surge in Akeso's Hong Kong-listed shares upon the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of newly discovered short stories by Harper Lee, one of her relatives has suggested that more significant unpublished works could still be found. Her nephew, Dr. Edwin Conner, spoke of the mystery surrounding a manuscript titled "The Long Goodbye," which was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird" and could be a prequel. He also raised the possibility of a complete manuscript for a true crime novel called "The Reverend," which Lee was known to be researching, creating excitement among literary scholars.</p>
