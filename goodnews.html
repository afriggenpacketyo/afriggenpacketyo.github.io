          <p>Exit polls suggest a tight competition between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the party of Governor Koike in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election.

          <p>Despite the U.S.'s direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, analysts believe that the U.S. will maintain its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific region. While the U.S. has repositioned some military assets to address the conflict, including temporarily diverting the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier, Washington has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to prioritizing strategic resources toward China. This suggests that the U.S. views China as a more significant long-term strategic challenge, despite immediate concerns in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>An Altoona, Iowa warehouse is providing temporary respite for importers facing tariff volatility by offering bonded warehousing space, allowing them to hold goods duty-free until they are ready to go to market. This arrangement allows importers to defer tariff payments, improving cash flow and managing risks associated with trade policy fluctuations. Bonded warehouses, overseen by the U.S. Port Authority, are becoming increasingly popular as companies seek to navigate the complexities of international trade. The facility is the first of its kind in the Des Moines metro area.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on baseball's unique relationship with failure, noting that even the best hitters fail more often than they succeed. The author uses Clayton Kershaw's near-perfect game as an example, highlighting how his gracious response to a teammate's error exemplified the importance of accepting imperfections. The essay contrasts this with Lou Gehrig's courageous response to his terminal illness, arguing that true greatness lies in how one handles loss and failure with humility and grace.</p>
