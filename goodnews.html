          <p>Rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace experienced a strong market entry, with its stock opening at $70 per share on the Nasdaq, a significant jump from its initial public offering price of $45. This successful debut values the company at nearly $10 billion and reflects growing investor interest in the space technology sector. The company has secured major contracts with entities like NASA and Northrop Grumman, and despite reporting a net loss, its revenue has seen a sixfold increase, signaling strong growth potential in a resurgent tech IPO market.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to their lowest average since May, reaching 8.13%, making them one of the most affordable borrowing options available. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs are likely to decrease further, presenting a timely opportunity for homeowners. Compared to more expensive alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, personal loans, or credit cards with near-record high interest rates, a HELOC currently offers a more financially advantageous way for homeowners to access funds.

Under new CEO Peter Stern, the company is implementing a cost-restructuring plan to save an additional $100 million, aiming to improve long-term financial health despite the impact on employees. The positive earnings were driven by better-than-expected sales and significant cuts in operating costs, including marketing and R&D.

          <p>President Trump is set to announce a historic peace pact between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House, with both nations' leaders in attendance. This agreement marks the first of its kind between the two former Soviet republics, which have been engaged in conflict for decades over disputed territories. As part of the deal, Armenia plans to establish a transit corridor named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity" to improve access to the West. The pact is seen as a key step for U.S. diplomatic efforts in the region, potentially opening new energy and trade routes that bypass Russia and Iran.</p>

This spike followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's data-driven approach to monetary policy. Waller, a Trump appointee who recently dissented on a decision to hold rates, is now seen as a leading candidate over previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. His perceived dovish stance and political independence have made him a favorable choice for investors watching the future of U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>
