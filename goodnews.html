          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:52:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025, retirees considering reverse mortgages face a more complex situation than traditional borrowers. While standard mortgage rates have dropped, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a wider range of factors, including lender margins and program rules, meaning they may not fall as quickly. However, lower rates can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree can borrow. The article advises that individuals should carefully compare fixed versus adjustable-rate options and consult multiple lenders to navigate the current financial environment.

          <p>A new analysis reveals significant disparities in property tax payments for homeowners across the United States, with median annual bills ranging from over $9,100 in New Jersey to under $800 in Alabama. Property taxes have risen 27.4% since 2019, becoming an increasing strain on household budgets, particularly for younger homeowners. The article notes that tax burdens are influenced by local home values, state tax structures, and specific policies, with some states lacking an income tax relying more heavily on property taxes to fund public services. Experts advise new buyers to budget for potential tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Denver, the quinceañera, a traditional 15th birthday celebration in Latin American cultures, is serving as a powerful rite of passage for young women to explore and define their identities. A local boutique specializing in quinceañera dresses has become a hub for families planning these elaborate events, which mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. For many teens, the process of planning the party, choosing a dress, and participating in the celebration helps them come out of their shell and build confidence. The tradition also allows families to pass down cultural heritage to a new generation.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs May Increase Prices on Halloween Goods, But Consumer Spending Expected to Rise</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may face higher prices for Halloween products like costumes, decorations, and candy this year due to the impact of tariffs on imported goods. Small business owners report that tariffs have led to increased wholesale costs, ranging from 5% to 19%, which may be passed on to shoppers. Despite the potential for price hikes, the National Retail Federation forecasts record Halloween spending of $13.1 billion this year. This suggests that while consumers are aware of rising costs and may seek out discounts, they are not deterred from celebrating the holiday.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the U.S. government from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, ruling that the administration's justification for their removal "crumbled like a house of cards." Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return, contradicting the government's claims. The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the deportations over Labor Day weekend. This decision reaffirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors, who are entitled to due process and cannot be subjected to expedited removal.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered insects from 112 million years ago preserved in amber in Ecuador, marking the first such find in South America. The specimens, which include ancient beetles, flies, and wasps, provide a rare window into the ecosystems of the supercontinent Gondwana during the age of dinosaurs. This discovery is particularly significant because it dates to a period when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. Researchers believe the find will help them better understand the co-evolution of plants and insects that shaped modern biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging they engaged in "illegal" ticket resale tactics that harm consumers. The suit claims the companies tacitly worked with scalpers to unlawfully purchase large quantities of tickets and used a "bait and switch" approach to inflate final prices with hidden fees. The FTC argues that these practices frustrate artists' intentions to keep ticket prices affordable and have cost fans millions of dollars. The lawsuit seeks to address the company's dominant control over the live event ticketing market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who faced intense criticism and rejection for his ideas, developed a method for emotional regulation that remains relevant today. He argued that by consciously observing our emotions with reason, a process now known as metacognition, we can move from being controlled by them to understanding and managing them. This approach involves pausing before reacting, analyzing the source of feelings like anger or fear, and offering oneself rational advice. By doing so, individuals can maintain equanimity and respond to censure with dignity rather than being overwhelmed by emotional turmoil.</p>

While some within the administration had advocated for a more aggressive half-point reduction, Hassett indicated that the gradual approach is a good first step toward lower rates. This positive reception contrasts with President Trump's previous harsh criticisms of the central bank's policies. The comments suggest a temporary alignment between the administration and the Fed on monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>
