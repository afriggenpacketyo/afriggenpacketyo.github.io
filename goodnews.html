His recent improvements mirror PSG's overall performance in the Champions League, though domestic mistakes persist. Despite his occasional weaknesses, Donnarumma has proven to be a formidable opponent, particularly in stopping penalties, making him a key factor in Arsenal's crucial game.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and new tariffs on China, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. market. The de minimis rule, which exempted imports under $800 from tariffs, has ended for shipments from China, leading to higher prices. However, both companies are adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shipping goods in bulk to U.S. warehouses. Experts suggest that their agile supply chains and competitive pricing will allow them to continue competing with rivals like Amazon.</p>
