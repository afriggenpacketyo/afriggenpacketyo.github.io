          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams was awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The court found that Mr. Adams was defamed by allegations that he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, which Mr. Adams denies. The BBC argued that their reporting was fair and reasonable, but the jury sided with Adams after deliberating for nearly seven hours. Adams stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable for upholding the ethos of the British state in Ireland, and his solicitor criticized the BBC for leaving the false allegation online for nine years, questioning potential political pressure.</p>

          <p>US technology-export restrictions targeting Chinese plane makers will delay China's jet engine indigenization process, according to analysts. The restrictions involve technologies linked to jet engines that could be built for Comac's civilian aircraft. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the US for maliciously blocking and suppressing China, vowing to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. Analysts believe China will now devote more resources to develop a home-grown jet aircraft engine within the next two to three years, potentially slowing down aircraft production in the meantime.</p>

          <p>A survey of hiring managers found that 62% believe employees with master's degrees perform the same or worse than those with a bachelor's degree and two years of experience. Despite this perception, 72% of hiring managers would still offer higher salaries to candidates with master's degrees. The survey suggests that while master's degrees are often seen as a sign of potential, employers are increasingly recognizing the value of real-world experience. Skills-based hiring is becoming more common, with some companies eliminating degree requirements for certain positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho plans to retire from the Japan Sumo Association amid uncertainty about the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The Mongolian-born winner of a record 45 elite-level championships was serving as the Miyagino stablemaster when it was closed in April 2024 after a top-division grappler was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers. The status of the stable is expected to be discussed at an extraordinary board meeting, and Hakuho is likely to hold a press conference a week later. Hakuho retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>
