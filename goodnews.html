          <p>Germany's new government, led by the CDU/CSU and SPD, is facing criticism for its plans to weaken climate protection measures.  The planned dismantling of the Building Energy Act, aimed at promoting heat pumps, raises concerns about the country's commitment to reducing reliance on fossil fuels.  The government's focus on securing energy supply through new gas-fired power plants is seen as counterproductive by environmental groups.  The article highlights the tension between economic priorities and climate action in Germany's new political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Ethnic Hungarian and Moldovan Voters Crucial in Romania's Presidential Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 04:34:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Romanian presidential election saw Nicusor Dan's victory significantly influenced by the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship.  These groups voted overwhelmingly for Dan, defying the endorsement of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for the opposing candidate.  This outcome underscores the importance of minority voting blocs in shaping Romanian politics and their role in supporting a pro-European, pro-democracy outcome.  The result also reflects a divergence between Orban's influence and the preferences of ethnic Hungarian communities in Romania.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's appeal against the government's decision to remove his police protection was rejected by the Court of Appeal.  The court ruled that Harry had misunderstood the workings of the body responsible for royal protection, Ravec, and that his situation was exceptional given his decision to step back from royal duties and live abroad.  Harry's case centered on his belief that Ravec unfairly treated him.  The article analyzes the key issues and legal arguments involved in the case.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 03:43:17 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, which was initially expected in the spring.  The delay has drawn criticism from opposition parties and charities.  The strategy is expected to address issues such as the two-child benefit cap.  The government maintains its commitment to tackling child poverty and plans to publish the strategy later in the year.</p>
