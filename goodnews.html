          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is predicted to re-enter the atmosphere soon. Experts are uncertain about the exact time and location of re-entry, but it is expected to occur within a specific latitude range. Despite the spacecraft's heat shield, some pieces may survive the descent, potentially landing on Earth. While the risk of injury is low, the event is being closely monitored, and any recovered fragments would legally belong to Russia, highlighting the complexities of space law and debris management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against consuming mussels harvested along the California coastline. Biotoxins accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms, making them poisonous to humans, and cooking does not eliminate the risk. Commercially grown mussels are exempt due to regular testing, but officials advise caution and recommend removing digestive organs from clams and scallops before consumption.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests a correlation between left-handedness and certain neurological conditions, indicating that left-handed individuals are more likely to have diagnoses such as autism and schizophrenia. Researchers analyzed data from over 200,000 people, finding that atypical handedness may be associated with language-related disorders like dyslexia. Neurologists emphasize that the findings are purely correlational and do not imply causation, as being left-handed does not guarantee the development of these conditions. The study aims to help experts understand how brains are organized and how they develop.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk had been detained after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to her criticism of the university's response to resolutions related to Palestine. Judge William Sessions criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, highlighting declarations attesting to her peaceful character. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Ozturk supported Hamas, but the judge found no evidence of violence or advocacy for violence.</p>
