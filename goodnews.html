          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have slightly decreased, making them a more affordable option for homeowners. The article provides a detailed breakdown of estimated monthly payments for a $100,000 loan over 10 and 15-year terms, comparing them to costs from earlier in the year. It also contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), advising borrowers to weigh the stability of a loan against the potential for further rate drops with a HELOC. This analysis offers a financial overview for those considering borrowing against their home's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly set to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven Pearl expected to take over the program. This announcement comes amidst swirling rumors that Pearl may pursue a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Tommy Tuberville, who is running for Alabama governor. Pearl has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously commented on his desire to make an impact beyond coaching. During his tenure, he led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances with a record of 246-125.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. more than doubled at one point after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock, calling it "the Shopify of mortgages." Jackson, known for his influence on the trading of Opendoor, revealed his firm holds a position and suggested the company is poised for massive growth by using AI to innovate the mortgage industry. He compared its low valuation to the much higher multiple of newly public Figure Technology Solutions, projecting that Better Home could be a "potential 350-bagger in 2 years." The endorsement caused a significant, immediate surge in the company's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern California is expected to remain humid with a possibility of showers through the upcoming weekend due to tropical moisture from the Pacific. While significant rainfall is not anticipated for the Los Angeles area, the weather pattern will create unusually muggy and unstable conditions. The highest probability for isolated storms is forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday, primarily affecting areas north and east of L.A. County. Meteorologists note that another system, Tropical Storm Narda, is developing off the coast of Mexico and could funnel more moisture into the region by early next week, potentially extending the wet and humid conditions.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change Causing Delays in Peak Autumn Foliage Across the U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 14:05:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As fall begins, experts note that climate change is generally causing peak autumn foliage to occur later than it has historically, with delays of about a week since the mid-20th century. The timing and vibrancy of leaf color changes depend on various factors like temperature, rainfall, and elevation, making precise predictions difficult. While warmer fall temperatures can delay the process, weather from previous seasons also plays a role in the intensity of the colors. Online foliage maps can help track general patterns, but local conditions create significant variations, so experts recommend exploring different locations and elevations to find the best views this season.</p>

          <h2>Average Monthly Cost for Medicare Supplemental Plans in 2025 Varies Widely</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 13:48:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly premium for a Medicare supplemental insurance plan, or Medigap, in 2025 can range significantly, from as low as $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. Most beneficiaries, however, can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans like Part G or Part N. Costs are highly dependent on factors such as the beneficiary's age, location, gender, tobacco use, and the specific plan chosen. To secure lower premiums, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing quotes from multiple insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing if one is in good health.

          <p>Michelob Ultra has officially become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial in both retail channels and restaurants. This marks a significant turnaround for parent company Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline in popularity is attributed to several challenges facing its owner, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker demand from its core Hispanic consumer base. The shift in market leadership is reflected in the companies' stock performance, with AB InBev's shares climbing while Constellation's have fallen significantly this year.</p>

Reid explained the interaction as a display of Kelce's passion, stating the team needed more "juice" at that point in the game. This is not the first on-field spat between the two, who had a similar, more intense incident during Super Bowl LVIII, which both later downplayed.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank's benchmark interest rate is excessively high and should be cut by nearly two percentage points. Miran contended that policy changes from the White House, including those on taxes, immigration, and deregulation, have lowered the neutral interest rate, making current monetary policy too restrictive. He warned that maintaining such tight policy risks unnecessary layoffs and higher unemployment. Miran's stance places him outside the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in last week's vote, advocating for a larger half-point cut.

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,700 per ounce as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bullion has gained over 40% this year, driven by ongoing purchases from global central banks and heightened geopolitical tensions. For investors looking to gain exposure, most experts recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than buying physical bars or coins. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically under 3%. (not investment advice)</p>
