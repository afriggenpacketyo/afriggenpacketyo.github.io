          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when authorities arrested Billy Cagle, 49, for allegedly threatening a mass shooting. Cagle's family alerted police after he streamed his intentions on social media, leading to his apprehension inside a terminal. Officers later found an AR-15 assault rifle with ammunition in his truck. Officials noted Cagle, a felon with mental health challenges, was charged with terroristic threats and attempted aggravated assault, highlighting effective community and law enforcement collaboration in preventing violence.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected Japan's first female Prime Minister, securing a majority in parliament as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 64-year-old conservative faces significant domestic challenges, including rising cost-of-living and public dissatisfaction, as well as complex international relations with South Korea and China. Her victory, achieved after a last-minute deal with an opposition party, comes during an uncertain economic period and aims to rebuild public trust in the LDP. Her appointment is a historic milestone for Japan, though some question her conservative stance on women's issues.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military has raided KK Park, a notorious cyberscam center near the Thai border, detaining over 2,000 individuals and seizing dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals. The operation, part of a broader crackdown on online fraud, targeted a hub infamous for holding foreign workers captive and forcing them into criminal activities. While the military attributes the center's operation to an ethnic minority militia, the group denies involvement. This move highlights efforts to combat widespread online scams originating from the region.</p>

          <p>Australia's cricket captain, Alyssa Healy, will miss the Women's World Cup match against England due to a minor calf strain sustained in training. This injury, though minor, casts uncertainty on her further participation in the 50-over tournament. Healy has been a pivotal player, scoring 142 runs against India and an unbeaten 113 against Bangladesh, helping the defending champions secure a semi-final spot with two games remaining. Beth Mooney will step in as wicketkeeper, and Tahlia McGrath is set to captain the side. The team hopes for her swift recovery to bolster their chances in the crucial knockout stages.</p>

          <p>ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), a leading Chinese memory chipmaker, is reportedly planning an initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai as early as next year, aiming for a valuation up to $42.12 billion. Founded with government backing, CXMT is central to China's strategic efforts to establish itself in the global DRAM market, currently dominated by other nations. The company seeks to raise between 20 billion and 40 billion yuan from the offering, reflecting a surge in China's semiconductor stocks. This move signifies China's ambition to bolster its domestic chip industry. (not investment advice)</p>
