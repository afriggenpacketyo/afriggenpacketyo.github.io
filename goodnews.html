          <p>Japan and the United States have reported progress in tariff talks and plan to hold intense ministerial-level discussions around mid-May to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, noted deepened discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation after meeting with U.S. officials. Japan is considering increasing purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplifying the screening process for imported cars to address trade imbalances and potential tariffs. The U.S. administration's new tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July under a 90-day reprieve.</p>

Nicholson reflects on her childhood living off the grid and how it resonates with the themes in 'Paradise.' She emphasizes her enjoyment of being on set and collaborating with fellow actors, while also acknowledging the need for personal space when preparing for intense scenes.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz is leaving his White House post and will be nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security adviser. The decision to nominate Waltz to be U.N. ambassador was made last minute. It was perceived at the White House that Waltz didn't adequately vet NSC staff, in addition to the Signal saga and a lack of a good fit between Waltz and the senior team. In March, Waltz came under scrutiny after he put together a Signal chat and mistakenly included The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, disclosing discussions with top national security officials about plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen.</p>

          <p>As the oldest Baby Boomers approach 80, President Trump is advocating for a second baby boom amid declining birth rates, even proposing a $5,000 "baby bonus." However, many young couples are choosing a child-free lifestyle, citing various reasons, including financial concerns, fears about climate change, career priorities, and simply not wanting children. Sociologist Amy Blackstone notes that people are raised to believe parenthood is their destiny, but some prioritize their relationship with their partner. While some remain confident in their decision, others, like Tiana Morales, wonder about the future and how holidays will look without a large family.</p>

          <p>Venmo is gaining traction in the peer-to-peer payment market, while Cash App is facing challenges. PayPal, the parent company of Venmo, reported strong earnings and maintained its forecast for the year, while Block, the parent company of Cash App, saw its stock plummet after missing revenue targets and issuing disappointing guidance. Venmo's revenue jumped 20% in the first quarter, driven by increased adoption of features like the Venmo debit card and instant transfers. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss sees monetizing Venmo as a key component of his turnaround plan for the company.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will be manufactured in India, while most iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will be produced in Vietnam. This shift aims to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which have posed challenges to Apple's supply chains and profit margins. While most iPhones will be made in India, China will remain a key production hub for Apple products sold outside the United States. Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% in the March quarter amid increasing competition from domestic brands.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a new "soda tax," adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, despite a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic drinks with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces, including sodas, coffees, and energy drinks. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the statewide ban was enacted in 2018. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, which has heavily lobbied against soda taxes. The American Beverage Association argues that the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

          <p>A North Korean hacker was caught attempting to infiltrate a US tech company by applying for an engineering role at the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. Executives allowed the hacker to proceed through the recruitment process to gather intelligence on their tactics. Red flags included a different name on the video call, a voice that occasionally switched, and an email address linked to a network of fake identities used by a hacking group. The hacker unraveled during the final interview when asked to verify their location and recommend local restaurants. State-sponsored attacks are a growing threat, with North Korean IT workers gaining employment at major companies to generate revenue for the state.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed an increase in the film tax credit to maintain competitiveness with New Jersey and other states. New York has spent more than $5.5 billion in incentives since 2017 to support film and television productions. Each New York household has contributed approximately $16 in taxes towards producing the drama series ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù since 2017. This is part of a broader trend where states use tax incentives to attract film and television productions, boosting local economies but also raising questions about the cost to taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed the company's strategy to diversify its supply chain in response to President Trump's tariffs on China. Hasbro aims to source 40% of its products outside of China by the end of 2026, with manufacturing shifting to countries like the U.S., Turkey, China, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to diversify production further as other supply sources mature. Cocks anticipates price increases due to tariffs but believes Hasbro's sourcing flexibility will help mitigate the impact. He also noted that 50% of revenue generated in the U.S. is either domestically-sourced or from "experiences or digital games."</p>
