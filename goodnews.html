          <p>Despite heightened tensions with Pakistan, India remains steadfast in its commitment to economic growth, according to India's High Commissioner to Singapore, Shilpak Ambule. While acknowledging operational alertness, Ambule emphasized that the country's growth story and economic focus remain unaffected. He highlighted recent trade deals with the UK and ongoing negotiations with the U.S. and the European Union, underscoring investor confidence in India's structural reforms and strong domestic demand. The comments followed Prime Minister Modi's announcement of a new counter-terrorism policy after military strikes against Pakistan, with Ambule stating that the future of the ceasefire depends on Pakistan's actions. Optimism remains high regarding India's economic trajectory despite geopolitical concerns.</p>

ANZ Bank also sees potential for China's GDP to exceed 4.2% this year. Natixis projects a GDP growth of 4.5% if there are proactive stimulus measures and further tariff reductions.

          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates have been reduced, but the impact on exporters remains complex. The headline changes include a 90-day period where Chinese goods shipped to the US are subject to a minimum of 30% tariffs, and American exports face a minimum of 10% duties. However, these rates do not account for previous tariffs or duties on specific goods. The new effective tariff rate is estimated to be around 50%, including tariffs imposed during Trump's first term and the new duties still in force after the agreement.</p>

          <h2>US-China Tariff Reprieve Offers Potential Relief for Christmas Supply Chains</h2>

          <p>The U.S.-China tariff cuts, although temporary, provide a significant boost for Christmas product supplies. With the speed of Chinese factories, the 90-day window can resolve most product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season. While the reprieve staves off a potential Christmas disaster for retailers, there will still be an impact on back-to-school sales, and added costs for tariffs and logistics, so prices will be going up overall. Even with the 90 day reprieve, the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products now stands around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties imposed in past years.</p>

          <h2>'Marsquakes' Suggest Presence of Liquid Water in Martian Crust</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 00:00:12 EDT</div>

          <p>Analysis of seismic waves from "marsquakes" and meteorite impacts by a China-led team suggests liquid water may be present in rock just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. The study, using data from NASA's InSight lander, revealed a zone in the planet's crust best explained by a layer of water-saturated rock. If confirmed, this underground layer could hold as much water as a global layer up to 780 meters thick, potentially resolving the mystery of Mars' missing water.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German companies, which have heavily invested in the United States, are starting to rethink their strategy due to trade tensions. Surveys indicate that German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the U.S., with many keeping their investments at home. The automotive sector has been particularly affected by tariffs, prompting companies to consider moving production to the U.S. Despite the tariffs, some companies like Haribo and Stihl remain committed to their U.S. operations, driven by factors like market access and local production.</p>

Tokyo and Osaka top the list, driven by Asian, European, and American travelers. The report notes that currency fluctuations have a greater impact on Asian travelers' decisions than those from other regions. Economic and political factors are also influencing travel preferences, with more people traveling to Saudi Arabia, while the United States is experiencing a decline in international visits.</p>
