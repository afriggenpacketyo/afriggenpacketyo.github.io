          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one targeting wealthy political donors and another aimed at meme coin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions of dollars. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, will feature David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will be held at Trump National, where access is granted based on the number of $TRUMP tokens held, offering the top 220 holders a chance to dine with Trump himself. The crypto community views Sacks' influence as a shift away from President Biden's policies.</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) an affordable option, but qualifying involves meeting lender requirements. Lenders typically look for sufficient home equity (at least 15% to 20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher), a low debt-to-income ratio (below 43%), and stable income and employment history. Homeowners can improve their chances by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant. The article advises that understanding these factors and preparing accordingly can help homeowners successfully tap into their home equity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instead of simply stopping credit card payments or filing for bankruptcy, cardholders should explore various debt relief solutions based on their specific circumstances. Stopping payments can lead to penalties, wage garnishment, and lawsuits, while bankruptcy has long-lasting effects on credit scores. Viable options include credit card debt forgiveness programs, debt management programs, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer cards. The article emphasizes that researching and choosing the right alternative can help cardholders regain financial independence and manage their debt effectively.</p>
