          <p>Former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Thom Tillis in 2026. In his announcement, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight for the middle class against corporate interests and criticized recent federal spending bills for increasing national debt while cutting social programs. His campaign reported raising $1 million within hours of the launch, signaling strong initial support for his bid to flip the Senate seat. The Republican National Committee chairman is also expected to enter the race.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which required the removal of his bladder. At a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed the tumor was successfully removed and that Sanders is now considered cancer-free. Sanders, who became emotional during the announcement, stated he never questioned "God, why me?" and will continue coaching. He used the opportunity to encourage others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health checkups to enable early detection of potential issues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a request by investment fund Azoria Capital to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the federal "Sunshine Act," which mandates open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a Trump ally critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, was a publicity stunt for the new fund. Azoria Capital stated it will continue its case, arguing for greater transparency and accountability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tropical storm in the central Pacific Ocean has rapidly intensified to become Hurricane Iona, the first hurricane of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Honolulu, it poses no immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center project Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward over the next couple of days. The storm is then expected to gradually weaken later in the week, remaining well south of Hawaii.</p>

This move, coupled with a recent meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice president, suggests that the American aerospace giant could benefit if a broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington is reached.</p>

          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting they can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When considering annuities, this rule serves as a useful benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. An annuity might offer a higher payout rate, providing protection against outliving one's savings, but often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of a traditional portfolio. This article explains how retirees can use both strategies to balance security and growth in their financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>
