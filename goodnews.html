        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that the university would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of waging a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary for national security and to combat antisemitism on campus. The BBC contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. A laser module and a phase encoding device were on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket that reached 2.5km during a two-minute vertical flight testing its reusability. The test marked a key step in China‚Äôs transition from experimental validation to the construction of a fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. The article details how QSDC skips the key-sharing step and sends the actual message directly through a quantum channel.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a fake online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The deceptive ad asks for personal information and payment through Cash App, which is not an official DMV payment method. The DMV advises renewing vehicle registrations only through its official website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office. The article reflects on how the DMV emphasizes the importance of protecting personal information and avoiding unofficial channels.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's frustration over the slow progress in securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. Official papers show his concern that the UK was lagging behind the US in production, despite penicillin being a British discovery. The prime minister expressed disappointment that Britain was unable to produce it at scale, and was pushing for a more abundant supply. Less than a fortnight before D-Day, sufficient supplies had been obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties.</p>

          <p>The Labour government plans to require developers to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move was "just common sense" and would save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork. The government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes.</p>
