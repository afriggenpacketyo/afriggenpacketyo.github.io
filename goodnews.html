          <p>Jake Paul secured a unanimous decision victory against former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. but was met with a hostile, booing crowd in Anaheim, California. In his post-fight interview, Paul defiantly told the audience to "shut the f--- up," stating that his actions in the ring speak louder than their words. The bout saw Paul control the majority of the fight against a largely inactive Ch√°vez, who only mounted a significant offense in the later rounds. The win improves Paul's record to 12-1, continuing his controversial but lucrative boxing career.</p>

          <p>Georgian-Spanish fighter Ilia Topuria became a two-division UFC champion by knocking out Charles Oliveira to win the interim lightweight title at UFC 317 in Las Vegas.

With this victory, he becomes the tenth fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two different weight classes simultaneously. After the fight, Topuria declared he represents the "new generation of mixed martial arts" and had a brief confrontation with potential future opponent Paddy Pimblett.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul earned a unanimous points victory over a lackluster Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. in a cruiserweight bout in California. Ch√°vez Jr., a former world champion, appeared passive for most of the fight, rarely throwing punches while Paul controlled the contest with his jab and consistent pressure. Despite a late surge from Ch√°vez in the ninth round, the judges scored the fight decisively in Paul's favor. The outcome prompted jeers from the pro-Ch√°vez crowd, while raising further questions about the caliber of Paul's opponents and his standing in professional boxing.</p>

Violators could face fines ranging from ‚Ç¨135 to ‚Ç¨700, although an initial grace period is in place.

This year's events occurred amid a political climate where LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals, have faced challenges from conservative-led efforts. Organizers emphasized themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" and "Queer Joy is Resistance" to reflect this reality. The parades also faced headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, as some companies have pulled back from diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

The initiative is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS aimed at creating the "healthiest generation of children ever."
