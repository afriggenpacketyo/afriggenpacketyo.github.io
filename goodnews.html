          <p>Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, and his girlfriend, model Vittoria Ceretti, 27, were recently seen enjoying a summer yacht trip off the coast of Spain. The couple, first linked in 2023, have kept their relationship relatively private, though Ceretti discussed the challenges of dating a high-profile actor in a recent Vogue France interview. In a separate discussion about aging, DiCaprio remarked that while he is now 50, he feels emotionally like he is 32. He also shared that reaching this milestone has given him a desire to be more honest and upfront in his personal and professional relationships, emphasizing the importance of not wasting time.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added 6,212 new words and phrases, reflecting the growing influence of internet culture on the English language. Among the new entries are terms popularized on social media, such as 'skibidi,' 'delulu,' 'tradwife,' and 'lewk.' 'Skibidi' originated from a viral YouTube series, while 'delulu,' short for delusional, describes someone believing things that are not true. The inclusion of these words highlights how online trends, particularly those popular with Gen Alpha, are having a lasting impact on mainstream communication. A dictionary representative noted that words are only added if they demonstrate significant staying power.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025. The holiday originated in the late 19th century from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions and was signed into law in 1894. While government offices, banks, and the USPS will be closed, most major retailers like Target and Walmart, along with grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. Costco is a notable exception, as it will be closed in observance of the holiday, following its traditional schedule.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles secured a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave, strengthening their position at the top of the men's Hundred cricket tournament table. After a strong bowling performance that restricted the Brave to 133 runs, the Invincibles successfully chased the target with 11 balls remaining. Key to the victory was a 101-run partnership between Jordan Cox, who scored 56, and Sam Curran, who finished with an unbeaten 50. With four wins in five matches, the two-time defending champions are now strong favorites to secure a spot in the final stages of the competition, demonstrating their consistent dominance.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to be based on a framework that would involve an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal also includes provisions for negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire to end the 22-month war. It remains unclear how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, while pressure from hostages' families to secure a deal continues to mount.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks FTC Investigation into Media Watchdog Group Media Matters</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to stop the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from investigating the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report in November 2023 alleging that advertisements on X (formerly Twitter) were appearing alongside antisemitic content, which prompted an advertiser boycott. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation likely represented a retaliatory action against the group for its constitutionally protected speech. The judge's ruling stated that government retaliation against organizations for engaging in public debate should alarm all Americans.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent meeting with President Donald Trump suggests a deliberate shift in diplomatic strategy compared to a contentious visit six months prior. This time, Zelenskyy appeared more collegial, wearing a suit and using humor, which contrasted with the previous encounter where he was criticized for his attire and perceived lack of gratitude. The presence of several European leaders also helped steer the conversation toward substantive issues like security guarantees. This more cautious and charming approach appears to be a lesson learned by Zelenskyy and his team on how to navigate the unpredictable nature of Oval Office meetings with the current administration.</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering alternative to Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to rewrite the ending, allowing Juliet to live and embark on a new life in Paris. The review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and its energetic direction, which transforms the story into a euphoric dance party. Featuring anthems by artists like Britney Spears and Katy Perry, the musical successfully recontextualizes pop hits to celebrate themes of second chances and self-discovery, led by a powerful performance from Rachel Webb as Juliet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no strict federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. The timing of an annuity purchase is a critical factor, as it affects both the cost and the potential payout. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. Purchasing later in life, such as in one's 70s, can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, but may also limit product availability and increase the risk of being disqualified for health reasons.

          <p>Astronomers are studying 3I/ATLAS, the third-ever observed interstellar object, which is currently hurtling toward the center of our solar system. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to Hubble Space Telescope observations showing a glow of light ahead of the object, but no corresponding cometary tail behind it. This has led to the intriguing possibility that the object is generating its own light, rather than just reflecting sunlight. Loeb suggests two potential explanations: it could be a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova, or it could be an artificially powered spacecraft. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter team has reportedly agreed to attempt to observe the object when it makes a close flyby of Mars this fall.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a former longtime meteorologist for WKYC-TV in Cleveland, has started a new role providing morning weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Canton, Ohio. Strano's departure from WKYC in 2024 came after 22 years with the station, following a guilty plea to a DUI charge and her subsequent public discussion of her recovery journey. She later filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging her termination was related to her sharing her story. In addition to her new radio gig, Strano also hosts a podcast and provides forecasts for radio stations in Georgia and Alabama.</p>
