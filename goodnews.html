          <p>Although the special counsel's office is vacant for the first time in a decade, the investigations of Robert Mueller, John Durham, Jack Smith, Robert Hur, and David Weiss continue to generate news. Recently released audio from Joe Biden's interview with Robert Hur revealed Biden's memory lapses, while the Secret Service visited James Comey over a deleted social media post interpreted as a threat against Trump. Declassified documents related to the Trump-Russia probe are expected to be released, and there are calls for a review of Hunter Biden's pardon after the release of Biden's audio tapes. </p>

The Kennedy Center claims previous leadership misled the board, a claim refuted by former board chair David Rubenstein.

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said ministers would change the threshold to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again.

          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high before slipping back down, pressured by rising Treasury yields and a dip in stock prices. The flagship cryptocurrency had climbed to $109,857 before trading flat at $106,678.74, according to Coin Metrics. Analysts attributed the initial surge to factors like softer U.S. inflation, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Despite the pullback, the cryptocurrency has benefited from both liquidity in the stock market and recent risk-off scenarios. (not investment advice) </p>
