          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strengthening euro. The German lender affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with pre-tax profits rising 34% year-on-year to €2.4 billion. While its investment banking division saw mixed results, with a strong performance in fixed income and currencies offsetting a decline in advisory services, the bank's overall financial health appeared robust. The results come as European banks navigate a lower interest rate environment and increased geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a plan to issue monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens, a rare move towards direct fiscal support aimed at easing the financial burden of its aging population. The electronic vouchers, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, are intended for disabled seniors to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This initiative seeks to bolster the social safety net, encourage the use of senior care services, and unlock domestic consumption by reducing precautionary savings among households. The program will be piloted in select cities before a planned nationwide rollout.</p>

          <p>London-based investment app Lightyear, positioned as a European competitor to Robinhood, has raised $23 million in a new funding round led by NordicNinja. The deal, which values the company between $200 million and $300 million, includes backing from prominent Estonian tech figures like Bolt co-founder Markus Villig. The company plans to use the capital for expansion into new markets and to launch new AI-driven features designed to provide investors with contextual information about stock price movements. Lightyear aims to differentiate itself by focusing on long-term investors rather than high-risk trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Mariona Caldentey has expressed caution ahead of the Euro 2025 final, stating that England possesses the inner strength to win the championship. The match is a highly anticipated repeat of the 2023 Women's World Cup final, which Spain won. Caldentey, who plays for Arsenal, acknowledged her familiarity with the English players' capabilities and expects a difficult contest. Despite England's challenging path to the final, including an extra-time semi-final victory, they are set to face a confident Spanish team competing in their first-ever Euros final.</p>

Farrell has maintained faith in his back-row and wings from the previous match, while making a key change at loosehead prop to strengthen the bench. The Wallabies are also bolstering their side, welcoming back key players Will Skelton and Rob Valetini for the encounter.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed. The landmark ruling could open the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the scandal. Questions are being raised about the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office and the role of senior bank managers and central banks in the rate-setting process. While the two men have been exonerated, the path to financial compensation from the government remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating the order violates the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. The clause grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. The 2-1 ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda and moves the contentious issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, a growing number of states are passing laws to compel cities and counties to allow for denser, more affordable housing development. Frustrated by local 'NIMBY' (Not In My Back Yard) opposition that stalls new construction, states like Utah and Texas are overriding restrictive local zoning rules. These state-level mandates aim to address a massive housing shortage that has priced many middle-class families out of homeownership. While proponents argue it's a necessary step to create wealth for younger generations, some local officials criticize the top-down approach for overriding community planning.</p>

The Inter Miami star's decision to skip the festivities has intensified a debate about the relevance and format of the mid-season showcase in a league with increasing fixture congestion. While the game serves as a key business and fan engagement event for the league, Messi's no-show is seen by some as a sign that top global talent may prioritize competitive matches over exhibition games. Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged that the league may need to rethink the event's format.</p>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can provide significant health benefits, challenging the popular but less scientific goal of 10,000 steps. The research, published in The Lancet Public Health, analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found that reaching the 7,000-step mark was linked to a reduced risk of dementia, heart disease, and cancer. Researchers suggest this more attainable target could encourage more people to track their activity to improve their health. While most benefits leveled off after 7,000 steps, the study provides a practical, evidence-based goal for daily physical activity.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography made a rare discovery on a La Jolla beach: a violet sea snail, or Janthina janthina. These creatures, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically live in warm tropical seas and have not been spotted locally in a decade. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore waters, prompting speculation about a potential link to climate change. The discovery has generated public interest, and scientists are urging beachgoers to report any further sightings of this small but mighty predatory snail.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission following his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This marks a significant change from his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The comments come after a tense spring training where he and his former manager appeared at odds over his role, which was ultimately settled as a full-time DH.</p>
