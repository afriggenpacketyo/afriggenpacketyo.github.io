          <p>Chinese state television aired a documentary on the development of the J-10 fighter jet, following reports that Pakistan's air force used the export variant, J-10C, to shoot down Indian planes in the Kashmir conflict.

The broadcast coincided with national pride surrounding the J-10C's alleged combat performance, with claims that it shot down foreign jets without any losses.

          <p>The tradition of the Indianapolis 500 winner drinking milk in the victory circle dates back to 1936, when Louis Meyer drank buttermilk after his third win, a refreshing choice inspired by his mother's advice. A dairy industry executive saw a photo of Meyer with the milk and requested it be given to every winner. While cold water was briefly offered in a silver chalice, milk returned as an accessory prize and has been enjoyed by 76 winners overall. This year's race will be broadcast on FOX, continuing the iconic tradition.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin hit a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price surge occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, diverging from its typical correlation with equities. Analysts suggest investors are seeking alternative stores of value amid broader macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Favorable regulatory developments in the U.S. and support from figures like President Trump and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have also contributed to the rally. (not investment advice)</p>
