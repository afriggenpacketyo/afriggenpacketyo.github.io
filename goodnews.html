          <p>Hong Kong's financial sector is experiencing a resurgence driven by China's tech-driven economy and geopolitical shifts, positioning the city as a leading fundraising venue. Over 100 enterprises, primarily from mainland China, are expected to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, contributing to a significant rise in the Hang Seng Index. This growth is supported by state policies and local government actions aimed at strengthening Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub. However, this financial boom contrasts with the struggles faced by the food and retail sectors, creating a risk of economic division within Hong Kong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, separated by the tragic murders of the Pelley family in 1989, rekindled their friendship after two decades of loss and searching. Stephanie, who grieved not only for the loss of the Pelley family but also for her friend Jessica, consistently visited and maintained the family's gravesite. Jessica, who survived the murders, was cut off from her Indiana friends by relatives, leading to years of isolation and a change of name. The two women finally reunited in 2009 through Facebook, discovering a shared connection to the past and a renewed bond of sisterhood.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has been released from ICE custody in Louisiana and has arrived back in New Jersey. A federal judge ruled that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. Khalil's arrest in March sparked protests and discussions about free speech, with accusations that the Trump administration is targeting pro-Palestine voices. Khalil and his supporters, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, assert that his detainment was a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's NSF Research Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 20:26:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling prevents a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, supporting arguments from universities that the cuts would threaten critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The case echoes similar legal challenges against funding caps imposed by the administration on grants from the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights for American citizens from Israel, with two flights departing from Tel Aviv to Athens. The evacuations began shortly before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating tensions in the region. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has encouraged other Americans needing assistance to register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. The move follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for evacuations, with some Americans opting for alternative routes out of the country.</p>

          <p>Belarus has released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following a visit from U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg and an appeal from the White House. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, which signals a potential warming of relations between Washington and Belarus. The released prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania, where they are receiving care, while European politicians and members of the Belarusian opposition have welcomed the news.

          <p>A BBC report offers a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by a GP practice during the 8 AM rush for same-day appointments. Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham describe the intense pressure and verbal abuse they endure as they try to manage high demand with limited resources. The Labour government has pledged to address the issue with increased funding and online appointment booking, but practice staff emphasize the need for a broader team of healthcare professionals to manage patient needs effectively. The report highlights the increasing demand for primary care and the ongoing efforts to improve access for patients.</p>

          <p>The band South Arcade is finding success riding the wave of Y2K core, a growing interest in the culture of the late 90s and early 2000s. Their upbeat, rocky guitar music draws inspiration from artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice, creating a nostalgic sound that resonates with both older and younger audiences. The band gained traction through TikTok, connecting with fans who appreciate the references to the Y2K era, and those discovering the music for the first time. The trend reflects a desire for escapism and a connection to a time when personal expression was more tangible, with rooms full of posters and action figures, rather than curated social media feeds.</p>

Originally designed to promote Jackson's album, these statues have taken on lives of their own, with some ending up in unexpected locations like a McDonald's in the Netherlands, a nightclub in Austria, and a Swiss fairground. The statues have become symbols of both Jackson's enduring legacy and the controversies that have surrounded him, with some being removed due to allegations of child sexual abuse.</p>
