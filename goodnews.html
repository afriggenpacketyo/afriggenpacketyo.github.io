          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is nearing the completion of its "quantitative tightening" program, which reduces its bond holdings, and hinted at further interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics, Powell noted a significant softening in the labor market, shifting the balance of risks between employment and inflation. While not providing specific guidance on rate cuts, his comments suggest easing is likely, as financial markets anticipate. The Fed aims for "ample" reserves for banks, signaling an end to the current balance sheet runoff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study reveals a stark disconnect between Gen Z's top values—self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people—and what hiring managers seek: achievement, learning, and hard work. This generational gap, with only 2% of Gen Z sharing their bosses' priorities, leads to frustration for both companies and young people, who are often labeled "unemployable." The article advises Gen Z to honestly assess their financial needs and consider temporarily embracing values like achievement and work-centrism if urgent employment is a priority, suggesting a long-term commitment for results.</p>

          <p>The IRS has released the 2026 capital gains tax brackets, featuring increased earnings limits for the 0% long-term capital gains rate. Single filers can earn up to $49,450 in taxable income, and married couples up to $98,900, to qualify for the 0% rate, offering significant tax planning opportunities for investors. Financial experts suggest this allows for rebalancing or diversifying taxable portfolios without triggering a tax bill, especially after strong market performance. However, selling profitable assets will increase taxable income, requiring careful projections. (not investment advice)</p>
