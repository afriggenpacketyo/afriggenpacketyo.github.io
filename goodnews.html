          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, the first agreement since the pause on reciprocal tariffs, though details are still being finalized. The deal includes increased market access for American exports, particularly agricultural products, and the UK will reduce non-tariff barriers. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a boost for trade and job creation, with Britain expecting reduced tariffs on cars and eliminated tariffs on steel and aluminum.

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the U.K., which he described as a "breakthrough" that will increase market access for American exports, especially agricultural products. The U.K. will reduce or eliminate non-tariff barriers, and the agreement is expected to boost trade between the two countries. The announcement spurred investor confidence, with markets showing gains, and the Treasury Secretary is scheduled to meet with a Chinese trade delegation in Switzerland.
