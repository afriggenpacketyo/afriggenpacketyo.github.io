          <p>Renowned filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, 86, was hospitalized for a scheduled cardiac procedure to update a treatment for atrial fibrillation (AFib), a condition he has managed for 30 years. His representatives confirmed the procedure was planned and that he is recovering well. AFib is an irregular heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke and other complications, affecting millions of people. Medical experts note that while not immediately life-threatening, the condition requires proper management, often through procedures like ablation, to prevent serious future health issues.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several European and NATO leaders will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a crucial meeting at the White House. This collective visit is seen as an effort to bolster Ukraine's position and ensure a unified front during peace negotiations following the U.S. president's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. Leaders from the European Commission, France, and Germany, along with the NATO chief, will be present for the talks. The move underscores Europe's determination to have a direct voice in any potential peace deal brokered by the United States.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russia has agreed in principle to allow the United States and European nations to provide Ukraine with security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This development, described as a significant concession, emerged from the recent summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents. An "Article 5-like" guarantee would mean an attack on Ukraine could be considered an attack on the guarantor nations, a key demand from Kyiv. This potential breakthrough will be a central topic of discussion during upcoming meetings between U.S., Ukrainian, and European leaders.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has been left out of the squad for the team's upcoming Premier League match against Arsenal. The decision was reportedly made by the coach amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future with the club. Hojlund's playing time is expected to be limited following the recent high-profile signing of striker Benjamin Sesko. AC Milan is reportedly among the clubs interested in signing the Danish player, although no formal agreement has been reached yet.</p>

          <p>A simple school desk, hauled to the top of Hancock Hill in Alpine, Texas, by university students in the late 1970s, has become an unlikely pilgrimage site. For over 45 years, visitors have hiked to the spot to enjoy the expansive desert view and leave messages in a notebook stored in the desk's drawer. These notebooks, filled with personal reflections, confessions, and words of encouragement, are now preserved in the local university's archives. The desk provides a unique, meditative space for introspection, transforming a simple piece of furniture into a cherished local landmark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule regarding player positioning. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the three-person defensive wall when the kick was taken. This rule, introduced in the 2019-20 season, requires all attacking players to maintain at least a one-meter distance from the wall to prevent interference and time-wasting. The referee announced the reason for the decision to the crowd, clarifying the application of this lesser-known law.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic-era fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party and event space. Purchased in 2017 for £555,000 by Mike Conner, the historic building had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. The five-year restoration project involved overcoming immense logistical challenges, including installing running water by cutting through 16 feet of rock. Now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub, the unique property is back on the market for £3 million.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key mental tool that helped her navigate a grueling 13-month recovery from a torn ACL. The practice, suggested by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, allowed Brink to focus on her goals and maintain a positive mindset during the often lonely rehabilitation process. By visualizing her future successes, from Olympic rings to simply being a good teammate, she was able to manage the anxiety and pressure of her return. This mental preparation is credited with helping her make an immediate and meaningful impact upon rejoining the team.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a waterfall in California's Kern River area. The man, an experienced rappeller, was pushed off his lines by the "extreme hydraulics" of the water and became stuck. After he was reported missing, search crews spent a day looking for him before a drone finally located him behind the cascade. He was found conscious and suffering only minor injuries and dehydration before being hoisted to safety by a highway patrol helicopter.</p>
