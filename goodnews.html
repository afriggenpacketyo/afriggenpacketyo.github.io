        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness during the day and triggering warnings from the National Weather Service. The storm, a phenomenon more common in the desert Southwest, caused visibility to drop dramatically, particularly around Chicago, where it fell to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. Meteorologists attribute the event to exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois combined with strong winds from thunderstorms. This is the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning for Chicago.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from a bone spur, but the Angels defeated the Dodgers 11-9, taking the series win. Kershaw struggled in the first inning, allowing three runs, but recovered somewhat in the following innings. Despite Kershaw's return, the Dodgers are currently missing several key starters due to injuries. Logan O'Hoppe had a career-high five RBIs for the Angels, while Freddie Freeman had four hits for the Dodgers. The game was marked by multiple lead changes and strong offensive performances from both teams.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized parts of the region. The majority of the refugees were women and children, who were transported across the border with the help of the UNHCR and Save the Children. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and the UNHCR, with the goal of reintegrating these individuals into Rwandan society. Many of the returnees, such as Nyirakajumba Twizere, were born in Congo and had never seen Rwanda, expressing joy at returning to their ancestral homeland.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fibre-optic gyroscope designed to enhance navigation stability across a wide range of temperatures for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This device, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a more stable way to measure orientation and turning rates. Fibre-optic gyroscopes, which rely on the movement of light in optical fibres, provide an alternative to traditional mechanical gyroscopes, offering immunity to interference and making them valuable for military and security applications. Interferometric fibre-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs) are used in various settings, including aerospace, weapons systems, oil platforms, and autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>The high demand for live shows in China is fueling a surge in tourism spending, as fans travel across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by offering travel packages that combine concert tickets with discounted accommodations and tourist attractions. Shily Zhou, an advertising professional, has traveled twice to see her favorite singer, Liu Yuxin, including a trip to Chengdu where her concert ticket granted her a discount to visit Qingchengshan, a famed Taoist mountain. With domestic consumption high on Beijing‚Äôs economic agenda, these initiatives aim to boost local economies by encouraging fans to spend beyond just the concert ticket.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's Season 50 finale opened with a skit featuring James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump, satirizing the president's recent trip to the Middle East, including the Qatari government's supposed $400 million plane gift. The skit highlighted the ethical concerns surrounding the gift, with the fictional Trump downplaying any potential quid pro quo. The skit aired shortly after the real Trump defended the deal on Truth Social, insisting the plane was a donation to the U.S. Air Force, not a personal gift. The sketch concluded with Johnson's Trump breaking the fourth wall and making remarks about the show's quality and the audience.</p>
