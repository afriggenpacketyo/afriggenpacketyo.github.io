          <p>Entertainer Michael Feinstein reflects on his five-decade career dedicated to performing and preserving the Great American Songbook. He recounts his early life as a self-taught pianist, his formative years working for Ira Gershwin, and his eventual rise to fame. Feinstein has since established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana, which includes a museum and a music academy for young performers. He believes the songbook is an evolving tradition, encompassing not only classics by Gershwin but also the works of modern artists like Carole King and Billy Joel, ensuring its legacy continues to resonate with new audiences.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas has directed her first film, 'My Mother's Wedding,' drawing inspiration from her own childhood tragedies. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, centers on three daughters grappling with loss as their mother prepares for her third marriage. Scott Thomas lost her father, a Royal Navy pilot, at age five, and her stepfather died in a similar accident five years later, experiences that profoundly shaped the film's narrative. She discusses how this personal history informed her creative process, her journey from shyness to a celebrated career, and her collaborations with legendary figures like Prince and Robert Redford.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Improved Work Quality, Not Just Free Time, Drives Happiness in Four-Day Workweek</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that increased employee happiness stems from more than just additional free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a significant factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. To fit their work into a shorter timeframe, teams are forced to eliminate inefficiencies, streamline processes, and focus on high-priority tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This boost in work-related self-esteem and reduced stress contributes substantially to overall well-being, fostering better work-life balance and even improved team spirit among colleagues working toward a common goal.</p>

          <p>The monumental and monochromatic sculptures of artist Louise Nevelson are being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art. Nevelson, who passed away in 1988, was renowned for her large-scale assemblages created from found objects, often discarded wood she collected from the streets of New York. Despite facing early anti-Semitism upon immigrating from Ukraine to Maine, she fiercely pursued her artistic vision, gaining widespread recognition late in her career. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, reflects on the artist's intimidating yet inspiring presence and her enduring legacy of pursuing one's passion without limitations.</p>

The visit, which includes a heavy security presence and has drawn small protests, will also feature meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. While senior EU officials have sounded positive, Trump has maintained that the chance of a deal is '50-50.'</p>

          <h2>Travel Expert Identifies Common Phrases That Can Make American Tourists Seem Rude Abroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel writer with experience in 70 countries outlines several phrases that can make American tourists appear inconsiderate or ignorant when abroad. These include asking for prices in U.S. dollars, commenting on how 'cheap' everything is, and asking locals 'What state are you from?' which presumes a U.S.-centric worldview. The article advises against seeking out American chains like Starbucks instead of supporting local businesses and warns that complimenting someone's 'good English' can be condescending. The author suggests that avoiding such phrases helps foster more respectful and meaningful interactions, allowing travelers to fully embrace the transformative experience of encountering different cultures and ways of life.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement a year ago to stabilize the company. Investors are responding positively, with stock prices up over 30% this year, as aircraft production and delivery numbers have improved. Ortberg has implemented significant cost cuts, navigated a machinist strike, and replaced key executives, earning praise from airline customers like Ryanair's CEO for improving quality. Despite progress, Boeing still faces major challenges, including an FAA production cap on its 737 Max and ongoing delays for new aircraft models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England rugby player Matt Dawson argues that for the current British and Irish Lions squad to be remembered as a truly legendary team, they must complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series win, Dawson suggests that the team's legacy depends on achieving this rare feat, last accomplished on a major tour nearly a century ago. He contrasts the current squad's public ambition for a clean sweep with his own 1997 Lions team, which won the series 2-0 but lost the final test in South Africa. Dawson believes the current team's superior fitness and Australia's relative weakness make a 3-0 victory an achievable and necessary goal.</p>

          <h2>Essay Laments the Decline of Music Event Listings and Its Impact on Cultural Discovery</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the near-disappearance of comprehensive arts and music event listings from publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times. The author argues that these listings were vital for cultural discovery, guiding audiences to a wide array of performances and helping to nurture robust subcultures. Their decline, driven by shifts in journalism and the rise of algorithm-driven social media, has created a feedback loop where only what is already popular receives coverage. This trend not only makes it harder for emerging artists to find an audience but also impoverishes the broader cultural ecosystem, which relies on the cross-pollination of ideas between niche and mainstream art forms.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks for investors seeking a regular income stream. Companies highlighted include EOG Resources, which recently increased its dividend following a major acquisition, and energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies, noted for its long-term growth projects. Telecom giant Verizon is also recommended for its solid dividend yield and upgraded profit guidance. Analysts believe these companies possess strong fundamentals and the capacity to consistently return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, offering a defensive option in the current economic environment.
