          <p>This article details the current price of gold, which stands at $3,652.25 per ounce as of September 15, 2025, according to American Hartford Gold. It comprehensively explores the numerous factors that influence gold prices, such as supply and demand dynamics, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate policies. Geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank actions also play significant roles in its value. Gold is consistently viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, historically retaining its value, making it a smart bet for many investors, though its price remains subject to constant short-term fluctuations.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 11:44:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores key considerations for homeowners contemplating mortgage refinancing amidst shifting interest rates, with 30-year refinance rates currently averaging 6.72%. Experts recommend assessing one's current mortgage rate, personal financial needs, and the potential benefits of acting now versus waiting for further rate drops, as market conditions could change. Refinancing offers opportunities to significantly reduce monthly payments, free up cash flow, or consolidate high-interest credit card debt, providing substantial financial relief. However, waiting carries an opportunity cost, as delaying could mean paying more interest over several months, making informed timing crucial for optimal outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

This proactive measure follows an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission into how AI chatbots might negatively impact children and teenagers. Upcoming parental controls, expected by month-end, will enable parents to link accounts, establish usage blackout hours, manage chatbot features, guide responses, and receive notifications in cases of acute distress. OpenAI emphasizes prioritizing safety over privacy for minors, recognizing the powerful nature of this new technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Workers are increasingly "hugging" their jobs, exhibiting a reluctance to leave, as evidenced by the lowest sustained quits rate since 2016. This trend is attributed to a cooling job market and slower hiring pace, creating uncertainty among employees. Career experts caution against complacency, advocating for a strategy of "pivoting in place," which involves seeking internal growth opportunities, developing new skill sets, and actively building professional networks. This proactive approach is deemed essential for maintaining career security and positioning oneself for future opportunities, especially as employers may feel empowered to demand more from a less mobile workforce.

          <p>A framework agreement for the social media platform TikTok's U.S. operations has been reached, involving both new and existing investors, with Oracle slated to maintain its crucial cloud services agreement. This deal, anticipated to finalize within the next 30 to 45 days, aims to alleviate long-standing U.S. national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to American user data or manipulation of the platform's algorithm. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that President Trump's willingness to allow TikTok to be shut down was a key factor in motivating China to pursue the agreement.</p>

          <p>Webtoon Entertainment shares experienced a significant surge, jumping over 25%, following the announcement of a deal to create a digital comic platform for Disney's Marvel and Star Wars brands. As part of this agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. The collaboration will consolidate more than 35,000 comics tied to Disney properties onto a single subscription service, offering a new revenue stream for Webtoon. Analysts consider this a "material expansion" that validates Webtoon's platform as a preferred destination for major intellectual property distribution, despite potential near-term investment requirements for platform development.</p>
