        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the confusion and frustration passengers face due to varying airline baggage rules. One passenger's experience of being charged extra for a bag that was slightly over the size limit highlights the issue. The EU is considering standardizing sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, with transport ministers proposing a maximum size of 40x30x15cm. Consumer groups argue this proposal doesn't go far enough and object to airlines charging for overhead cabin bags. Airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and allow them to keep fares low, but pressure is mounting for change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK doctors are testing 'poo pills' containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat superbug infections. These pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with healthy bacteria, addressing antibiotic resistance, which kills an estimated one million people annually. The focus is on the bowels, which are considered a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance. Early trial data from Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals show promising signals that poo pills can help tackle superbugs and increase the diversity of gut bacteria, which is a sign of good health. This approach represents a shift in understanding the importance of bacteria for overall health.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring their offices are modest and their spending is in order. The campaign, running since 2012, aims to improve the Communist Party's image and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest it also ensures resources are spent wisely to compete with the United States. The campaign is also seen as a way to identify loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to media control and the difficulty of enforcing rules on a large scale.</p>
