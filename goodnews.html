          <p>Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of the infant formula startup Bobbie, is challenging the long-standing market dominance of companies like Reckitt and Abbott. Inspired by her own experiences as a mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 to offer higher-quality, organic products and shift the cultural conversation around feeding babies. The company, which started as a direct-to-consumer subscription service, has grown rapidly, gaining significant market share, particularly after a 2022 shortage highlighted the risks of the concentrated market. Bobbie focuses on mission-aligned marketing, such as advocating for paid family leave, to build a strong community around its brand.</p>

          <p>John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis have won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their foundational research on quantum tunneling, which has become crucial for advancing digital technology. Their work, conducted in the 1980s, helps bridge the gap between the subatomic quantum world and larger, more practical applications. The Nobel committee highlighted that their discoveries are fundamental to the next generation of innovations, including quantum computing, cryptography, and highly sensitive sensors. The laureates' research has taken concepts from the century-old field of quantum mechanics and made them applicable to tangible technologies that power modern devices like cellphones.</p>

          <p>With home prices elevated and interest rates declining, borrowing via a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable option for homeowners. A $75,000 HELOC now carries monthly payments between approximately $712 and $906, significantly lower than costs seen in the summer of 2024. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even cheaper if the Federal Reserve continues its anticipated rate cuts later this year. This article breaks down the potential costs and compares them to recent periods to illustrate the current financial opportunity for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence scored a dramatic, game-winning touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs after a moment of near disaster. On the final drive, Lawrence stumbled and fell after his foot was stepped on while taking the snap at the 1-yard line. Instead of throwing the ball away to stop the clock, he got back up, scrambled to his left, and dove into the end zone to secure a 31-28 victory. In a post-game interview, Lawrence described the experience as "sheer panic," explaining his initial instinct was to get up and stop the clock before he saw an opening to run.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 250% in premarket trading after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company. This move is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc, which are vital for energy and defense technologies. The partnership includes a $35.6 million investment and reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, a controversial 211-mile industrial road in Alaska. The decision aims to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global critical minerals supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to launch its first locally manufactured observation satellite, named 'Chi Po-lin,' from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California later this year. The launch marks a significant advancement for Taiwan's space program, transitioning from single satellites to developing its own satellite constellations. This is the first of eight spacecraft in the Formosat-8 system, a high-resolution optical remote sensing project aimed at bolstering the island's technological capabilities. The move is seen as a critical step for Taiwan in the competitive global space race, especially amid mainland China's rapid advancements in the field.</p>

          <p>According to a new survey from travel association ABTA, the number of travelers using artificial intelligence to plan or book their trips has doubled over the past year, rising from 4% to 8%. The trend is particularly popular among younger holidaymakers, although AI still trails far behind traditional methods like internet searches and recommendations from family and friends. While the technology presents both an opportunity and a challenge for the travel industry, less than a fifth of respondents currently feel comfortable handing over their entire holiday planning to AI. The report also noted that overall holiday travel is continuing to rebound toward pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after she proactively pushed for early screening. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered by a high-risk clinic revealed two suspicious masses. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer at a stage with a 99% five-year survival rate. The American Cancer Society advises women with higher risk factors to begin conversations about screening with their doctors in their mid-20s, as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with permethrin insecticide can significantly reduce malaria infections in young children. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers conducted a trial where babies carried in treated wraps had a 65% lower rate of malaria compared to a control group. This simple, low-cost intervention could provide crucial daytime protection for children under five, a group highly vulnerable to the disease, complementing existing tools like bed nets. Researchers noted the effect was beyond their expectations and believe it could be a critical new tool in the fight against malaria.</p>

          <p>In a historic milestone, renewable energy became the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, according to data from the energy think tank Ember. The rapid expansion of solar and wind power met 100% of the growth in global electricity demand, even causing a slight decrease in fossil fuel use. However, the progress is uneven, with developing nations like China and India leading the clean energy transition while richer countries, including the U.S. and EU, increased their reliance on fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency predicts this divide may widen due to differing government policies.</p>
