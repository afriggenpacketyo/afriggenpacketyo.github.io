          <p>A judge in South Carolina has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the City of Charleston against numerous energy companies over the effects of climate change. The judge ruled with prejudice, stating that state courts are not the appropriate venue for such broad claims and that allowing them could lead to limitless litigation following any weather event. The city had alleged that the companies created a public nuisance and failed to warn about the climate impact of fossil fuels. This ruling is seen as a significant setback for the "climate lawfare" campaign seeking to hold energy producers liable through the court system.</p>

According to the company, GPT-5 is its "biggest single step forward" in global accessibility, with a basic version available for free to users worldwide.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing the Trump administration's demands for domestic manufacturing. The commitment focuses on expanding relationships with U.S. suppliers for key components like glass and sensors, but stops short of moving final iPhone assembly to the country. During a White House meeting, President Trump expressed satisfaction with the announcement and indicated Apple would be exempt from a planned tariff on chips. This strategy allows Apple to highlight its U.S. contributions while avoiding the costly shift of its global supply chain.</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe published by the UK's Good Food website has sparked outrage among Italians. Critics were angered that the recipe included non-traditional ingredients like parmesan and butter, with an option for double cream, instead of the correct pecorino cheese. The description of the dish as a "speedy lunch" also drew ire, as it is considered simple but challenging to master. The controversy escalated to the point where an Italian restaurant association contacted the British embassy in Rome to protest the misrepresentation of their culinary heritage.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has sided with environmental groups, ruling that a state commission's decision to slash incentives for rooftop solar can be legally challenged. The unanimous decision sends the case back to a lower appeals court, which had previously deferred to the Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) expertise. The lawsuit argues the PUC violated state law in 2022 when it cut the value of credits homeowners receive for sending excess power to the grid. Environmental advocates hailed the ruling as a confirmation that the PUC is not above the law, reigniting the fight over the future of solar energy policy in the state.</p>

          <p>The movie "Freakier Friday" serves as a reunion for stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, whose chemistry remains the film's strongest asset. The sequel complicates the body-swap premise by having four female characters switch physiques, but the plot feels secondary to the simple joy of seeing the original duo on screen again. While the new characters and their conflicts are thinly sketched, the film delivers hijinks and humor, with Curtis in particular having a blast playing a vain teenager in a grandmother's body. The article concludes that while the movie won't replace the beloved 2003 original, it's a disposable delight for fans.</p>

This has led the club to make inquiries about Brighton's energetic midfielder Carlos Baleba. However, acquiring another expensive player would require United to first offload several unwanted members of the squad, creating a complex transfer situation as the deadline approaches.</p>
