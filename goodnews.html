          <p>North Korean authorities have detained three shipyard officials following the failed launch of a naval destroyer earlier this week. The ship's stern was damaged during a launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, who called it a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness." Pyongyang denies any serious damage and claims repairs will take 10 days, but observers suggest it could take longer.

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. Roberts cited the need for Ohtani to build up his innings gradually, making a pre-All-Star return unlikely. The team initially considered an earlier return but prioritized his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehab.</p>

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has apologized for inaccurately describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study material. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students and drew strong public criticism. The company has corrected the misinformation and taken the video offline. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands of people who consumed contaminated seafood in areas around Minamata Bay.</p>

          <h2>UK Takes First Step in Rail Renationalization Scheme</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 23:45:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Britain's South Western Railways has become the first private operator to return to public ownership, marking the first step in the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire network by the end of 2027. The move aims to address the poor reputation of UK rail services, characterized by frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. Rail unions have welcomed the state takeover, while the government claims renationalization will save millions in compensation fees paid to rail operators.</p>
