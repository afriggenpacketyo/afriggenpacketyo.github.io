          <p>KindlyMD's shares experienced a dramatic 350% surge following its merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment company led by Trump's cryptocurrency advisor, David Bailey. The new entity secured substantial funding through convertible debt and a private investment deal, with Bailey noting significant investor interest. Despite KindlyMD's original focus on combating opioid addiction, the merged company plans to rebrand and acquire bitcoin-native businesses, aiming to build a global network of bitcoin holdings. Bailey, a vocal supporter of Trump, has advised on digital asset policy and emphasizes the company's focus on increasing bitcoin per share (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Episcopal Church is ending its partnership with the U.S. government for refugee resettlement, citing moral opposition to resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa, a group classified as refugees by the Trump administration. The church's presiding bishop, Sean W. Rowe, emphasized the church's commitment to racial justice and its historical ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, noting that accepting this request would cross a moral line. This decision comes as the Trump administration has largely frozen the refugee program, with Afrikaners being among the few granted entry as refugees since January. The church will continue to support immigrants and refugees in other ways, despite winding down federally funded services.</p>

The receptionist, who was held at gunpoint, described how the robbers, dressed as police officers, forced him to lead them to Kardashian's room, where they proceeded to tie her up and steal millions of euros worth of jewelry.

          <p>A power failure caused major disruptions across the London Underground network, the London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to line suspensions and delays.

Passengers faced difficulties as they were rerouted between stations, with some expressing frustration over the lack of updated information from staff. National Grid attributed the problem to a fault on its transmission network in central London, while Network Rail reported weather-related issues at King's Cross station.</p>

The agreement marks a return to tariff rates before Trump's trade war began, but supply shortages and price increases may still affect American consumers.

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement but confidence in reaching an agreement. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments previously but lifted the ban after implementing evaluation protocols, however, an "unacceptable northward advancement" of the screwworm has prompted the new suspension.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds after the New York City Campaign Finance Board determined that he likely coordinated with a super PAC supporting his mayoral campaign. The board found that the super PAC, Fix the City, aired an ad that appeared to align with spending instructions posted on Cuomo's campaign website, a tactic known as red-boxing. Cuomo's campaign has stated it operated in compliance with campaign finance laws and will work to resolve the issue with the board. The board also voted to continue withholding millions of dollars in matching funds from Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs, following successful trade negotiations, with a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since April. Both sides committed to ongoing discussions to address concerns in their economic and trade relationship. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China will lower its levies on American imports to 10%. China also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. The White House hailed the agreement as a step toward opening up China, but some analysts question the long-term commitment to easing tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering eliminating automatic "stop-start" systems in cars, which shut off the engine when the vehicle is idle. Lee Zeldin, head of the EPA, stated that the EPA approved the technology but everyone hates it, so they are fixing it. The systems, designed to conserve fuel and reduce pollution, have become common due to stricter carbon dioxide emissions standards. However, drivers have raised concerns about potential damage to the battery and engine. The RAC argues that these are myths and the systems improve fuel economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "total reset" in trade terms between the US and China following talks in Switzerland, leading to significant cuts in tariffs. The US will lower tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs will drop to 10% from 125%. The agreement, however, is temporary, with the levies suspended for three months. The retreat comes as US ports reported a sharp drop in ships arriving from China and factory output slowed. China's commerce ministry said the agreement was an important step to "resolve differences" and "deepen co-operation."</p>
