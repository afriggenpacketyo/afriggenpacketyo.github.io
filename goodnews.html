          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government secured trade deals with the EU and the US, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the article suggests these deals required concessions, highlighting Britain's weakened standing as a midsize economy squeezed between larger trading blocs. The agreements include benefits such as easier travel for Britons in Europe and reduced tariffs on British luxury cars in the US, but also involve politically sensitive trade-offs like allowing European fishing in British waters. While the deals offer some economic benefits, they do not fully compensate for the economic impact of Brexit, leaving Britain to navigate a complex global trade environment.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction between Beijing and Washington, Chinese exporters are intensifying efforts to diversify away from the U.S. market. A survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains a likely scenario, with Chinese exporters seeking alternative markets and American firms shifting production out of China. Even with the tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than pre-Trump levels.</p>

The guidelines also acknowledge inequalities in the history of treating pain, noting that Black patients and women have historically received less attention to their pain.
