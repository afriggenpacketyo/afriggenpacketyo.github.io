          <p>The UK has initiated a nationwide rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine, a world-first effort to combat unprecedented infection levels. Initially targeting high-risk groups, the program utilizes the 4CMenB vaccine, originally for meningitis B, which is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea. Health officials hope this will curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains and alleviate pressure on sexual health services, as 2023 saw over 85,000 cases, the highest in nearly a century. The move is praised by charities as a significant advancement in public sexual health.</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a long-serving Trump administration insider, has resigned from her role as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Considered the highest-ranking official to leave the second term voluntarily, she will transition to a special government employee to finalize ongoing policy work. Mailman, known for her close ties to Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, plans to start her own government affairs firm.

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, retreat. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted area. This was one of five unauthorized airspace incursions over the weekend, prompting officials to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restriction notices (NOTAMs) before every flight. NORAD emphasized that such intercepts are conducted with the highest regard for safety.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a way for women to preserve fertility, but the procedure comes with significant financial burdens and no guarantee of success. A single cycle can cost between $12,000 and $13,000, with many women undergoing multiple cycles to increase their chances, and most paying out-of-pocket. Fertility experts caution that success is not assured, as there is a drop-off at each stage from thawing the egg to a successful birth. Despite the expense and uncertainty, many women view it as a valuable "insurance policy" that provides peace of mind and more control over their reproductive timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind is advancing artificial intelligence with models that can interact with the physical world, including a new AI called Genie 2. CEO Demis Hassabis demonstrated how Genie 2 can take a single static image, such as a photograph of a waterfall, and transform it into a playable, 3D interactive environment. This technology has implications for entertainment and gaming but also serves a larger goal of building AI "world models." These simulated environments can be used to train AI agents and robots to perform complex tasks, potentially accelerating learning in a safe and scalable way.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred about 10 kilometers below the surface, causing brief shaking but no significant damage or injuries. The event startled residents, with some reporting it felt like an impact or a loud boom, but officials confirmed there was little cause for alarm. This tremor follows a much larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare an emergency. The pilot of Flight 108 issued a "mayday" call as the Boeing 787 was ascending, reporting a failure in the left engine. Air traffic control guided the aircraft back to Dulles, where it landed safely with no injuries reported among the 219 passengers and 11 crew members. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline arranged alternative travel for the affected customers.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a steep 66% drop from its debut, a larger decline than seen with previous Marvel films. The weekend's new releases, the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the reboot "The Naked Gun," secured the second and third spots, respectively. Analysts noted the surprisingly sharp fall for the superhero film given its positive reviews, suggesting a challenging start to the month for the summer box office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly overtaken California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of streamlined regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar compared to natural gas. However, this growth faces headwinds from the impending rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's continued reliance on natural gas and emerging grid constraints also pose challenges to its long-term solar momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years on people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This new measure aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat gangs that promote dangerous English Channel crossings online. According to the Home Office, a significant majority of the record 25,000 migrants who have crossed this year used social media to contact smugglers. The Labour government is facing pressure to address the "small boats" crisis and views this as a key step in disrupting the smugglers' business model.</p>
