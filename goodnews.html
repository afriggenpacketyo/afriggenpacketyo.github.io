          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived in Ottawa for a two-day visit to Canada, widely interpreted as a message of support amidst threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, welcomed the royal couple, and the King is scheduled to deliver a "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament. The visit is seen as a sign of solidarity with Canada, rejecting Trump's suggestion that the country should become the 51st U.S. state.</p>
