          <h2>Tesla Enters Indian Market with Model Y Priced at Approximately $70,000</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially launched in India, opening its first showroom in Mumbai and listing its Model Y SUV for a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other markets. This premium pricing is attributed to India's high import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle to compete with luxury brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. Analysts suggest this initial move is a strategy to "test the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market, rather than a push for high sales volume. The company has not yet committed to local manufacturing, which could eventually lower costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>Hampshire spinner Liam Dawson has been called into the England cricket squad for the fourth Test against India, marking a potential return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who has been ruled out of the series with a broken finger. Dawson's selection comes as a reward for his outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion notably comes ahead of fellow left-armer Jack Leach, who holds an England central contract.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Introduces Grants of up to £3,750 to Boost Electric Vehicle Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:36:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a new scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles by offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The grants, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to EVs costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making them more affordable for families and accelerating the transition from petrol and diesel cars. While the initiative is welcomed by carmakers, critics point out that the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure remains a significant barrier for many potential buyers. The government aims to increase the number of charging points from 82,000 to 300,000 by 2030.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX capsule carrying the four-person crew of Axiom Space's fourth private mission has successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding an 18-day stay at the International Space Station. The mission, commanded by veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson, marked several milestones, including the first spaceflights for astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary in decades. During their time in orbit, the crew conducted approximately 60 scientific experiments, the most of any Axiom mission to date. This successful return marks another step forward for the commercial spaceflight industry and its collaboration with NASA.</p>

          <p>China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), the brokerage arm of the major Chinese bank, has received a virtual asset license from Hong Kong regulators. This license permits CMBI to offer a range of services including cryptocurrency trading, custody, and advisory to clients outside of mainland China. The move reflects a broader trend of mainland financial institutions with international operations seeking to enter Hong Kong's regulated crypto market. This development allows CMBI to tap into the growing global demand for digital assets while operating within a structured regulatory framework, separate from mainland China's strict crypto prohibitions.</p>

          <p>During an interview at the FIFA Club World Cup final, President Donald Trump humorously suggested he could issue an executive order to change the American term "soccer" to "football." While the comment was made in a lighthearted manner, it reflects the growing prominence of the sport in the United States. The term "football" is used globally for the sport, while "soccer" is common in countries like the U.S., Canada, and Australia to distinguish it from other forms of football. The president was in attendance as the British club Chelsea won the newly expanded tournament held in New Jersey.</p>

Brentford's manager praised the signing, highlighting Henderson's leadership qualities as crucial for replacing the experience lost from other recent departures from the club.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration has granted Nvidia approval to sell its advanced H20 computer chips to China. These chips are crucial for developing artificial intelligence, and their sale had been previously restricted due to national security concerns. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the news, stating that the U.S. government assured the company that licenses would be granted, allowing deliveries to start soon. This decision follows lobbying efforts by tech leaders who argued that the restrictions hindered U.S. competitiveness in the vast Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, "The Dry Season," author Melissa Febos chronicles her decision to take a year-long break from sex and dating at age 35. Following a difficult breakup, she embarked on a period of celibacy to develop a more authentic relationship with herself and intimacy. Febos explains that by withdrawing the immense energy she had previously devoted to romantic and sexual pursuits, she found it available for other parts of her life, such as her creative work, friendships, and activism. She describes the experience not as one of lack, but as a period where her world became more sensual and spiritually fulfilling.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are rapidly gaining attention as a potentially groundbreaking form of digital currency, with Congress close to passing a regulatory framework for the sector. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically by being backed one-to-one by a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar. Their main appeal lies in the ability to transfer money instantly and cheaply across the globe, bypassing traditional banking systems. However, critics raise significant concerns about their safety, the transparency of their reserves, and the systemic risks they could pose to the broader financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After securing a spot in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals, a statistical analysis compares the England Lionesses' current performance to their victorious Euro 2022 campaign. While the team has scored fewer goals overall (11 versus 14), the scoring has been more distributed, with eight different players finding the net. The article notes that despite conceding more goals this time, the team faced a significantly tougher group, including world number 10 France. Coach Sarina Wiegman has also been more flexible with her lineup and substitutions, which has paid dividends in turning around their campaign after an opening-game loss.</p>
