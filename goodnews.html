          <p>Following a televised interview, the widow of Corey Comperatore, who was killed at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, received phone calls from both President Trump and Secret Service Director Sean Curran. Comperatore had publicly demanded accountability from the Secret Service for security failures that allowed the shooting to occur one year ago. Director Curran expressed his regret, apologized for the lack of communication, and agreed to meet with her to review the case. President Trump offered his condolences and support, stating that a comprehensive report on the assassination attempt will be released.</p>

Nvidia's stock continued its ascent after the company reached a $4 trillion market capitalization, with CEO Jensen Huang's White House visit seen as a significant positive development.

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. The article outlines four main strategies, including credit counseling, which can help create a manageable debt plan with reduced interest rates. Another option is credit card debt forgiveness, where a company negotiates a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors. For short-term issues, many lenders offer hardship programs with temporary relief, while for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance to reset finances.</p>

          <p>Former Reform MP Rupert Lowe has been cleared of wrongdoing by Parliament's standards commissioner following a brief investigation. The inquiry was reportedly initiated over allegations that he failed to properly register donations from a crowdfunder for his independent "Rape Gang Inquiry." Lowe provided evidence showing that the donations were received on June 23, meaning the 28-day window for registration had not yet expired and no rules were breached. Lowe described the complaint as a malicious attempt to undermine his inquiry and stated he would be complaining about the media's reporting of the story.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates potentially poised to fall, now is a critical time to evaluate high-yield savings accounts. A major advantage is that rates remain high, currently offering over 4.30%, providing a strong return on savings. These accounts also maintain liquidity, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty, unlike CDs that lock up funds. However, a key disadvantage is that these variable rates could fall preemptively, even before the Federal Reserve officially makes a cut. Additionally, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer traditional branch banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into Bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, these funds recorded their largest single day of inflows for 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential inflationary impact of new government spending, which can make alternative assets like Bitcoin more attractive. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum as traders were forced to buy back the cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>
