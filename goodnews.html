          <p>A recent tentative deal between Air Canada and its flight attendants, which includes partial pay for ground time, has intensified the push for similar compensation in the United States. Unions representing tens of thousands of US flight attendants argue that their members deserve to be paid for all hours worked, including the critical tasks performed during boarding and deplaning. This movement highlights a long-standing industry practice where cabin crews are often not compensated until the aircraft doors close, leading to financial hardship for many workers.</p>

          <p>The average value of an NFL team has climbed to $7.65 billion, an 18% increase from the previous year, solidifying the league's status as the world's most valuable sports entity. The Dallas Cowboys remain the most valuable franchise at $12.5 billion, with eleven teams now exceeding an $8 billion valuation. This growth is driven by massive media rights deals and strong national revenue streams, which are shared equally among all 32 teams, further enhanced by new equity deals like the NFL's stake in ESPN.

          <h2>A Case for Introducing Smartphones to Children as Early as Age Three</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the popular "Wait Until 8th" movement, some experts argue for introducing smartphones to children as young as three, but in a highly controlled and gradual manner. The approach involves starting with limited functions, like a family photo album, and slowly adding features such as a camera, audiobooks, and eventually calling family members. This method aims to foster digital literacy from a young age and turn technology use into an ongoing conversation between parents and children, preparing them for an increasingly tech-dependent world.</p>

          <p>Following China's recent Victory Day military parade, renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau commented on the crucial role of foundational disciplines like mathematics in developing advanced weaponry. He stated that without deep, original innovation in basic sciences, a country's technological progress can be constrained by others. His remarks came after the parade showcased China's latest arsenal, including AI-powered drones and information warfare equipment, highlighting the link between academic strength and modern military power.</p>

          <p>Creatine supplements have surged in popularity, with claims extending beyond muscle growth to include cognitive and metabolic benefits. Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate is effective for increasing lean muscle mass and improving short-burst athletic performance, particularly when combined with resistance training. While newer research explores potential benefits for bone health and brain function, experts say the evidence is still emerging and less conclusive, advising that for most people, the supplement is safe but not a "magic bullet."</p>

          <p>In response to increased federal immigration enforcement, the California Legislature is advancing several bills to create "safe havens" for immigrants in the country illegally. The proposed laws would restrict immigration agents' access to nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require officials to notify families of any enforcement actions on campus. These measures aim to ensure that all residents, regardless of immigration status, can access education and healthcare without fear of detention or deportation.</p>

          <p>While headlines often equate student AI use with cheating, the reality is more complex, as high levels of academic dishonesty existed long before generative AI. Early research suggests that AI has changed the method but not necessarily the overall rate of cheating, with many students using it for tasks like brainstorming or improving their own work. The article argues for a nuanced conversation about why students cheat, the mixed messages they receive about AI, and how education must adapt to a world where these tools are ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has demonstrated remarkable consistency, reaching the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam tournaments.
