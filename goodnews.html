          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 14:56:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup, reportedly declined a potential acquisition offer from Meta before Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI. The source familiar with the matter stated that the two companies did not finalize a deal, and Perplexity ultimately walked away from the discussions. This move highlights the intense competition in the AI sector, as Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, aggressively seeks to enhance its AI capabilities to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article humorously explores the trend of adding protein to virtually every food product, from iced tea to cold foam. It notes the proliferation of protein-enhanced items in supermarkets, including protein tortilla chips, protein water, and even protein-fortified pale ale. The author questions the necessity of such widespread protein consumption, noting that the average American already exceeds the recommended daily intake. The article suggests that food companies are simply capitalizing on the perception of protein as a universally healthy ingredient.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist, stating that the government failed to prove his release would cause irreparable harm or that he was a flight risk. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliatory for his protected speech during the Columbia encampment protests. The ruling came despite an immigration judge denying Khalil's asylum request and ordering his continued detention. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained since March by ICE agents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The movie Materialists, directed by Celine Song, explores modern dating through the lens of a professional matchmaker, Lucy, who sees relationships as a marketplace where net worth is paramount. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle between a wealthy partner in a private-equity firm and an aspiring actor, forcing her to confront her own values. The film critiques the commodification of love but struggles to balance its satirical aims with a compelling narrative. The reviewer finds the characters thinly written and the transformation of the lead character unconvincing, ultimately deeming the film tonally inconsistent.</p>
