        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data suggests that people receiving the new state pension in the UK are likely to see an increase of over £500 per year starting in April. The "triple lock" policy ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. With the Office for National Statistics reporting total pay including bonuses rose by 4.7% in the three months to July, this figure is expected to determine the annual increase. The increase will depend on individual contribution history. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The forthcoming "Hillsborough Law" will require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters, with potential criminal sanctions for non-compliance. This legislation aims to prevent cover-ups and ensure accountability, inspired by the Hillsborough disaster and other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire. The bill, set to be introduced to Parliament, includes a "duty of candour," obligating public officials to act honestly and with integrity at all times during investigations. Campaigners and families of victims welcome the law as a crucial step towards justice and preventing future suffering caused by institutional dishonesty. The law is expected to change the balance of power in Britain.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer is aiming to showcase the "special relationship" between the two countries and secure favorable trade deals. The visit includes royal ceremonies and bilateral meetings focused on tech partnerships and energy agreements. Despite political differences, Trump's apparent affinity for the UK may provide a boost to Starmer amid low approval ratings. </p>

Despite multiple comebacks, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the Phillies, who extended their lead in the race for the No. 2 seed. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the importance of winning every game, acknowledging the need to prepare for the intensity of playoff-like matchups. The loss puts additional pressure on the Dodgers to close the gap in the remaining games of the regular season. </p>
