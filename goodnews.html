          <p>A group of former inmates in Boston is volunteering to help renovate the historic Tremont Temple Baptist Church, a landmark known as America's first integrated church. One volunteer, who served 21 years in prison, expressed that the restoration work has given him a new sense of purpose, likening the church's renewal to his own personal reform. The project, which includes painstakingly reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs from the 1890s, is seen by participants and the church's pastor as a powerful example of personal transformation and community acceptance. The renovations are anticipated to be completed in October.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a searing rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio violated the First Amendment. The judge found they unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation based on their protected political speech, with the intent to chill activism on college campuses. In the 161-page decision, the judge accused the officials of misusing their power for "ignoble ends" and criticized the use of masked ICE agents to "terrorize Americans into quiescence," affirming the judiciary's role in defending constitutional values.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team overcame a significant middle-order collapse to defeat Sri Lanka by 59 runs in their opening match of the Women's World Cup. After slipping to 124-6, a crucial 103-run partnership between Amanjot Kaur and Deepti Sharma revived the innings, helping India post a competitive total of 269-8. In response, Sri Lanka started well but faltered after the dismissal of their captain, Chamari Athapaththu. Deepti Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets as India bowled Sri Lanka out for 211 in front of a record-breaking crowd in Guwahati.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, finding a trustworthy debt settlement program is crucial, as the industry contains both helpful and predatory companies. Reputable programs can be identified by several key characteristics, including professional accreditation from organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and a good standing with the Better Business Bureau. A legitimate company will also have a transparent fee structure and is legally prohibited from charging upfront fees before successfully settling a debt. They will provide honest communication about the process's risks, including potential credit score damage, and offer a realistic timeline for resolution.</p>

          <p>While Warren Buffett famously advises most people to invest in low-cost S&P 500 index funds for broad market exposure and steady long-term growth, CNBC's Jim Cramer offers a different perspective. Cramer agrees that index funds should form a core part of a portfolio but argues that investors should not settle for average returns. He encourages individuals to also research and select a handful of individual stocks with the potential for significant growth, believing that anyone can develop the savvy to pick winners and outperform the market average.

          <p>DoorDash has introduced a fleet of autonomous delivery robots, called Dots, to the streets of the Phoenix metro area. These red, five-foot-tall bots are designed to handle smaller orders, such as toiletries or a single meal, that do not require a full-sized vehicle for transport. The Dots can travel up to 20 miles per hour, carry up to 30 pounds, and are uniquely capable of navigating roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks. DoorDash's AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for the bots, aiming to create a more efficient and economical local commerce ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts on some prescription drugs for American consumers and provide medications to Medicaid at lower prices. The move is a result of the administration's "most favored nation" executive order, which pressures drugmakers to align U.S. prices with lower costs paid in other high-income countries. Pfizer's CEO, present for the announcement, stated that the threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad motivated the company's swift action, which includes moving more production to the U.S. The discounted drugs will eventually be available through a new government-run website called "TrumpRx."</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners. For an $80,000 HELOC, current monthly payments are estimated to be around $966 for a 10-year repayment period and $759 for a 15-year period, based on an average rate of 7.88%. These costs are notably lower than they were in previous months, reflecting the impact of the Fed's monetary policy adjustments on variable-rate credit products. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the provision in the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires most negative information, like late payments and charge-offs, to be removed from a credit report after seven years. This clock starts from the date of the first delinquency. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, which limit a creditor's ability to sue for the debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear after seven years; collectors can still attempt to contact you for payment, though they lose their legal recourse to sue.</p>
