          <p>Crypto company Circle Internet Group reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million, largely due to a 90% growth in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite this, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, primarily from non-cash charges related to its recent IPO. CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed confidence, citing surging interest from major financial institutions following the passage of new crypto legislation. The company also announced a new proprietary blockchain, Arc, for stablecoin payments and capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and inflation, many retirees are considering annuities for a stable income source. This article examines the safety of annuities, noting that their security depends on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, not FDIC backing. It advises checking insurer ratings and highlights that state guarantee associations offer limited protection. The piece also explains how different annuity types carry varying risks and how inflation can erode the purchasing power of fixed payments over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on finding hope amidst a difficult political climate, suggesting that embracing absurdity and humor is a powerful form of resistance. She argues that laughter, particularly the brand of humor found in Monty Python, can provide buoyancy and disrupt the fear-based tactics of political bullies. Lamott recounts a personal anecdote at a nail salon to illustrate that small acts of kindness and a commitment to joy can serve as an antivenom to widespread cruelty and despair. She encourages readers to rally, help others, and keep their spirits up.</p>

          <p>During a family holiday in the UK, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with Robert Jenrick, a prominent Conservative Member of Parliament and the shadow justice secretary. The meeting took place in the Cotswolds, where Vance is staying. This follows an official meeting Vance had with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy earlier in the week to discuss international affairs. Jenrick and Vance, who are meeting for the first time, share similar conservative positions on issues like immigration and free speech.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising and unsolicited bid to purchase Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. This move comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in its recent antitrust loss, where the company was found to have an illegal search monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal. Google has not yet commented on the offer or disclosed its plans following the antitrust ruling.</p>

          <p>England international Jack Grealish has completed a season-long loan move from Manchester City to Everton. The 29-year-old winger, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, fell out of favor last season and is seeking to rejuvenate his career. Grealish stated that a conversation with Everton manager David Moyes was key to his decision, expressing his excitement to join the "massive" club. The move offers him a chance to secure regular playing time and potentially win back his spot in the England national squad.</p>

          <p>For investors seeking stability, a Certificate of Deposit (CD) offers a predictable return, with current rates providing significant interest on a large deposit. This article calculates that a $100,000 deposit could earn over $4,400 in a one-year CD or more than $22,500 in a five-year CD, based on available rates. While these returns may be lower than potential stock market gains, they are guaranteed and insulated from market volatility. The piece advises consulting a financial advisor before committing a large sum due to early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

After landing his Cessna aircraft without authorization on King George Island, he was detained by Chilean authorities and charged with providing false flight plan data. In a recent agreement, the charges were dropped in exchange for a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and a three-year ban from Chilean territory.

          <p>Florida is tackling its invasive Burmese python problem by turning conservation into a competitive event, encouraging hunters to capture the destructive snakes in the Everglades. This approach is part of a global trend where conservationists use lethal methods to control invasive species that threaten native ecosystems. Examples from other regions include shooting gray squirrels in Britain and trapping feral cats in Australia. By gamifying the python hunt, Florida aims to mobilize public participation in a critical environmental management effort.</p>

The Nevada Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that Gruden cannot be forced into the NFL's internal arbitration process, which would be overseen by Goodell, a defendant in the case. The court found that because Gruden was a former employee when the dispute arose, the arbitration clause in the NFL Constitution was inapplicable. This decision clears the way for Gruden's lawsuit, which alleges a "malicious campaign" to leak his old emails and destroy his career, to proceed in open court.</p>

This performance has almost doubled the gains of the broader S&P 500 index over the same period, fueled by investor enthusiasm for AI and crypto-related companies like Coreweave and Circle. Analysts suggest this resurgence is reminiscent of a post-financial crisis rebound rather than the "crazy levels" of the 2020-2021 boom.
