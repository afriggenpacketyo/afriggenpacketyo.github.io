          <h2>Shopify's Stock Reacts to Cautious Guidance Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 16:07:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight dip following the release of mixed first-quarter results and a cautious outlook for the current period. The company's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, addressed concerns about President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, noting that the expiration of a favorable trade loophole is not expected to significantly impact Shopify in the near term, as only a small percentage of its gross merchandise volume is related to affected imports. Hoffmeister also highlighted that Shopify's consumer base tends to be higher-income, making them less sensitive to potential price fluctuations. The company is actively monitoring data to support merchants and adapt to potential market changes.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, in an interview on ABC's "The View," expressed his belief that sexism and racism contributed to Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat in the 2024 presidential election. Biden defended Harris's qualifications, emphasizing the consistent campaign to undermine the notion of a woman, particularly a woman of mixed race, leading the country. He also mentioned ongoing self-reflection and plans to write a book, while acknowledging Harris's difficult decision regarding her future political involvement, including potential gubernatorial or presidential ambitions. Biden affirmed his close relationship with Harris and expressed hope for her continued engagement in public service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan aimed at lowering Medicare drug prices, according to sources. This initiative echoes a previous attempt during Trump's first term to tie Medicare drug prices to the lowest prices paid by other countries. The earlier proposal faced legal challenges and was ultimately abandoned by the Biden administration. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently hinted at the policy's potential return, citing high drug prices in Europe. The plan aims to address the rising costs of prescription drugs, but its implementation and effectiveness remain uncertain.</p>
