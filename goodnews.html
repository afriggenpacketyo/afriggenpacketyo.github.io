        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward an agreement regarding TikTok's U.S. operations following a phone call, though a final deal has not yet been reached. The White House confirmed the productive conversation, which followed conflicting statements from Trump and Chinese state media about the status of the negotiations. The discussions aim to resolve the national security concerns that led to a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American business or face a ban. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline, signaling a desire to keep the popular video-sharing app operational in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a Republican-led short-term spending bill aimed at preventing a government shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The measure, which passed by a narrow 217-212 vote, extends government funding for just over seven weeks and includes additional funds for lawmaker security. The bill now faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it will require Democratic support to overcome the 60-vote threshold for passage. Democrats have signaled strong opposition, proposing a counteroffer with different priorities, setting the stage for a contentious fight as the deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that athletes from Russia and Belarus will be permitted to participate in the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Games as neutral individuals. This decision maintains the sanctions previously applied for the Paris 2024 Summer Games, which were imposed following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Competitors will not be allowed to use their national flags or anthems, and they must undergo a vetting process to ensure they have no links to the military or have not actively supported the war. The Russian Olympic Committee itself remains suspended for violating the Olympic Charter.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has stated that he did not discuss his vote on interest rates with President Trump ahead of this week's policy meeting. Miran, who dissented by voting for a larger rate cut than the committee approved, affirmed that his decision was made independently and without political pressure. His comments address growing concerns about the central bank's independence amid President Trump's public calls for aggressive rate cuts and criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Miran described the atmosphere at the policy meeting as collegial and professional, despite the external political controversy surrounding his appointment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 11:52:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fate of TikTok's U.S. operations may depend on a potential licensing deal for its powerful and closely guarded algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations between the U.S. and China. Previously, the Chinese government and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, appeared unwilling to sell the core technology, which is credited with the app's immense popularity. However, recent statements suggest a softening stance, with a possible framework allowing a U.S. entity to use the algorithm under specific terms rather than owning it outright. This arrangement could address ownership demands while raising new questions about data security and potential continued influence from China.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles secured his fourth successive 200-meter world title at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, equaling Usain Bolt's record in the event. After taking bronze in the 100m earlier in the week, Lyles delivered a dominant performance in his favored discipline, finishing with a time of 19.52 seconds. The victory marks a moment of redemption in the city where he struggled with depression during the 2021 Olympics. Lyles' American teammate Kenny Bednarek claimed the silver medal, while Jamaica's Bryan Levell took bronze in a highly competitive final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking significant steps to attract energy trade back to the waterway after losing business during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG carriers and are developing a new pipeline project, the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This would free up canal slots for other vessels and provide an alternative transit method for energy products. These initiatives aim to reverse the decline in LNG transits, which saw many tankers divert to longer routes, and come as the canal forecasts a broader decrease in freight volume.

          <p>Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time during Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, leading his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc in a one-two finish. Hamilton's performance was aided by a slipstream from Leclerc, and he expressed newfound confidence in his car's braking system after recent adjustments. The session was less successful for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed into a wall at Turn Four, causing significant damage to his car's rear suspension. The incident cut his practice session short, which he described as a "costly" mistake that leaves him behind on crucial data gathering for the race weekend.</p>

          <p>A new initiative named DACH Against Hate has been launched in Germany to address the sharp rise in antisemitism since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent conflict in Gaza. Supported by Jewish communities, public figures, and over 200 organizations, the group is petitioning for stronger legislation, improved education, and better protection for Jewish institutions. Organizers, including patron Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich, emphasized that the Middle East conflict is often used as a pretext for hatred against Jews.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent price increases for new iPhone models are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the launch of the latest iPhone, Cook stated directly that tariffs were not factored into the new pricing structure, which saw a $100 increase for the iPhone 17 Pro model. To mitigate the impact of trade levies, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, moving some production to countries like India and Vietnam. The company previously reported taking an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in a single quarter, making the pricing strategy a key focus for analysts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance confirms that workers in specified service fields like healthcare, legal, and financial services will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, the rules specify that automatic gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties at restaurants, do not count as qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments. The new tax break, enacted as part of a larger bill in July, is set to apply from 2025 through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>
