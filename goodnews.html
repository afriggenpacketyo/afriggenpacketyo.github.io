          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners in a lawsuit challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store nuclear waste in Texas.  The court determined that Texas and the landowners lacked standing to challenge the decision because they did not intervene in the initial licensing proceedings. The ruling does not address the commission's authority to license private offsite storage.  The dissent argued that the commission's decision was unlawful.</p>
