          <p>Stephen A. Smith, ESPN's prominent sports analyst, is actively pursuing broader influence in American media and politics, drawing inspiration from figures like Joe Rogan. Smith has been engaging with political figures from both sides of the aisle on his podcast, aiming to transcend his sports-centric image. He has even teased a potential run for president in 2028, though he acknowledges his lack of qualifications. The article highlights Smith's efforts to build a wider audience and impact, leveraging his existing platform and skills in performance and debate, while also recognizing the challenges and criticisms he faces as he ventures into new territories. The article suggests that Smith's ambition reflects the blurring lines between news, entertainment, and politics in contemporary media. Smith is also unafraid to address controversy and criticism head-on, which is a hallmark of his brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The justices questioned the practicality and constitutionality of the order, with concerns raised about creating a patchwork citizenship system. The administration argued that lower courts overstepped their authority, while opponents claimed the order violated the 14th Amendment. The court's decision could significantly impact the president's ability to implement policies without congressional approval and the role of the judiciary in checking executive power.

          <p>Microsoft is reducing its workforce in Silicon Valley, cutting 122 positions as part of a company-wide reorganization and restructuring. The layoffs, impacting employees working remotely or in Mountain View and Santa Clara, are part of a broader reduction of roughly 3% of Microsoft's global workforce.

          <p>Investing in gold requires careful consideration and isn't based on a specific timeline, such as investing a certain amount weekly, monthly, or annually. Instead, gold should be viewed as a small but important component of a portfolio, typically not exceeding 10%.

Starting sooner is generally advisable, but investors should be wary of selling all of their gold investments now despite profit-earning opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal theory that narrowly restricted lawsuits against police officers for using deadly force, ruling that courts must consider all relevant circumstances, not just the "moment of threat." The case stemmed from a police shooting in Texas where an officer shot an unarmed Black man during a traffic stop. While the lower court had favored the officer based on the "moment of threat," the Supreme Court's decision requires a broader evaluation of the events leading up to the shooting. Justice Kavanaugh suggested the officer might still prevail under the broader standard, while Justice Sotomayor dissented, saying the ruling allows officers to "shoot first and think later."</p>

The court's arguments focused on whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders nationwide, and whether this would undermine judicial checks on executive power.

A twin-engine configuration could increase performance, payload, and potentially range, but would also add weight and cost. The Navy might particularly value a twin-engine F-35, and it could also appeal to export customers.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House proposes new tax cuts, including making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding other reductions that could affect millions of Americans. The bill includes a new $4,000 deduction for seniors, increases the standard deduction, extends and increases the Child Tax Credit, and eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, and car loan interest. Democrats oppose the bill due to proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and some criticize the temporary nature of certain tax cuts. The bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy specifically designed to repair his unique mutation. The treatment involved infusing billions of microscopic gene-editors that targeted a mutation in his liver, appearing to have corrected his defect. The baby, KJ Muldoon, is now able to eat more protein and is meeting developmental milestones. Doctors emphasize the treatment's potential to help people with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. The work began decades ago with federal funding for basic research on bacterial immune systems.</p>

          <p>Some Republicans are concerned that their party is struggling to recruit strong Senate candidates, after prominent figures in Georgia and New Hampshire opted not to run in key races. Concerns exist that candidates too closely tied to Trump or the right wing may struggle in statewide elections. However, other Republicans argue that these decisions don't indicate broader recruiting challenges. The NRSC is working with President Trump to deliver for the American people and protect their majority in 2026. Democrats are hoping to expand their Senate map, but face a challenging landscape with many seats up for election in Republican-leaning states.</p>
