        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress is evaluating the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents, including large financial institutions and crypto firms, argue that clear rules would enhance consumer protection, reduce volatility, and facilitate faster, lower-cost digital transactions. The legislation aims to legally define what can be termed a stablecoin, potentially opening the market for banks and credit unions to issue their own digital currencies and boosting their mainstream adoption in the financial system. The move is part of a broader push to bring regulatory clarity to the digital asset industry.</p>

          <p>United Airlines surpassed second-quarter earnings expectations and issued a new, more confident forecast for 2025, with CEO Scott Kirby stating the "world is less uncertain." The airline reported adjusted earnings of $3.87 per share, beating estimates, although revenue of $15.24 billion fell slightly short of analyst predictions. While domestic revenue per seat mile declined, premium cabin sales showed robust growth, indicating continued demand for higher-end travel experiences. The updated annual forecast projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, reflecting optimism for a strong finish to the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, surged following a procedural vote in the House that revived prospects for passing key crypto-related legislation this week. Investor optimism grew after President Trump indicated that several Republican lawmakers who previously blocked the bills had reversed their stance after a White House meeting. The primary legislation, the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and the more complex CLARITY Act for market structure, are seen as crucial for providing regulatory clarity and fostering growth in the U.S. digital asset ecosystem.

          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter financial results that significantly beat Wall Street estimates, largely due to a surge in trading revenues. The bank posted earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $16.79 billion, compared to analyst expectations of $1.96 per share and $16.07 billion in revenue. The Institutional Securities division saw strong performance propelled by high client activity, particularly in equity trading. Additionally, the Wealth Management segment delivered robust net revenues of $7.76 billion, bolstered by higher asset management fees, reflecting consistent performance across key business areas.

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international match in Southampton, successfully chasing a target of 259 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma anchored the run chase with a crucial unbeaten score of 62, guiding the tourists to victory with 10 balls remaining. Despite a late-inning rally from England that created some tension, Amanjot Kaur's composed 20 not out ensured India achieved its second-highest successful ODI chase. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 were notable performances in an otherwise subpar effort.</p>

The partnership is a significant win for Google's cloud unit, which also supports AI company Anthropic. OpenAI's strategy now includes a multi-cloud approach, also leveraging capacity from providers like Oracle and CoreWeave to support its resource-intensive AI models.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his strategic handling of U.S.-China relations, culminating in Washington's approval to resume sales of specialized AI chips to China. Huang consistently argued that restricting access to the Chinese market would ultimately harm U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with the White House. By cultivating relationships in both Washington and Beijing, he successfully navigated complex geopolitical tensions to secure licenses for Nvidia's H20 chips. This diplomatic effort has been hailed as a major achievement, reinforcing his reputation as a uniquely skilled business statesman. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) platform is gaining significant traction at the state level, often outpacing federal action. States like Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma have enacted laws reflecting his agenda, such as mandating warning labels for food additives, banning certain artificial dyes in schools, and moving to defluoridate water supplies. While Kennedy has pressured food companies to voluntarily change their products, his broader goals are being more swiftly implemented through state legislation. This state-led approach allows the administration to advance its policies without creating new federal regulations, a strategy Kennedy appears to be encouraging.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial body of the United Nations, tasked with settling legal disputes between member states. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, the court's jurisdiction applies when states agree to submit to its authority, either through a blanket declaration or on a case-by-case basis. It also hears cases based on specific treaties, such as the Genocide Convention, which has been invoked in recent cases involving Ukraine, Myanmar, and Israel. However, the ICJ's primary limitation is its lack of an enforcement mechanism, meaning its binding rulings depend on the cooperation of the involved nations.</p>

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado and a celebrated author, has died at age 49 after living with ovarian cancer. Gibson was known for their decision to accept their terminal diagnosis rather than framing it as a "battle," a perspective they said led to some of the most joyous moments of their life. Their poetry was celebrated for its earnestness, empathy, and accessible language, often exploring themes of love, kindness, and social justice with unselfconscious intensity. Gibson's work resonated deeply with a wide audience, transforming personal pain and political fury into verse that championed a softer, more gentle way of being in the world.</p>
