          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on organized retail crime has resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states, marking a significant effort to combat the growing issue of shoplifting. Led by Illinois' Cook County regional organized crime task force, the operation involved over 100 jurisdictions and more than 30 retailers, including major chains like Home Depot, Macy's, and Target. Authorities emphasize that focused prosecution can deter such conduct, as criminals become aware of the serious consequences. Retailers have reported substantial increases in shoplifting incidents and associated dollar losses in recent years, prompting calls for stricter enforcement and adjustments to felony thresholds. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that mortgage rates are unlikely to fall significantly immediately after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, as they are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield and broader economic signals. Despite encouraging signs of declining inflation, the job market remains solid, reducing the urgency for the Fed to cut rates. Industry professionals recommend that potential homebuyers consider purchasing now if they are financially ready, citing less competition and negotiating power in the current market. While rates may remain in the mid-to-upper 6% range through mid-2025, experts emphasize that today's rates are not historically high, and refinancing remains an option if rates decrease in the future.

Blackstone's Vice Chairman Thomas Nides emphasized that shifting money into Europe is a good bet, while Tamsin Coleman of Mercer noted asset managers are building headcount in Europe in anticipation of new opportunities.
