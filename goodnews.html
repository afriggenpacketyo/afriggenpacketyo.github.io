He retired from T20 internationals in 2024 after India's World Cup victory, but is expected to continue playing one-day internationals.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, outlawed in Turkey, the EU, UK, and US, has declared it is laying down its arms and disbanding, stating it has "completed its historical mission". The move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the group to dissolve itself, signaling a potential shift towards resolving the Kurdish issue through democratic politics. President Erdogan needs the support of pro Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election, due in 2028. While it is unclear what Ocalan and his supporters will get in return for disbanding, there is speculation that he may be paroled.</p>

          <h2>Unlocking the Secret Superfood Potential in White Rice and Pasta</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 05:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Food scientists have discovered a method to transform refined carbohydrates like white rice and pasta into healthier options by increasing their resistant starch content. Cooking and then chilling these foods converts digestible starch into resistant starch, a type of fiber with numerous health benefits, including improved gut health and enhanced insulin sensitivity. By simply refrigerating cooked rice or pasta overnight, individuals can create a super nutrient in their own kitchens, turning fast carbs into slower carbs. This process effectively lowers the food's glycemic index and provides prebiotic benefits.</p>
