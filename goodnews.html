          <p>China's food delivery market is seeing intensified competition as major players Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in central kitchen infrastructure. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 'Raccoon Restaurants' over three years, which are food court-style hubs designed exclusively for takeaways to lower costs and increase efficiency for its partners. In response, JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own 7Fresh kitchens, aiming to develop and promote a thousand different menus nationwide. These strategic moves signal a new phase in the battle for dominance in the on-demand local delivery industry.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. The article suggests that the current high-rate environment, with many CDs still offering over 4% APY, presents a valuable opportunity to lock in favorable returns for a longer term. It advises savers to act before their CD automatically renews, potentially at a lower rate, and to shop around for the best available offers. The continued pause provides a window to secure high rates before potential future cuts by the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham strongly defended her teammate Caitlin Clark against critics who question her status as the face of the WNBA. In a podcast appearance, Cunningham called arguments against Clark's impact 'literally dumb,' asserting that the league's current prominence is directly tied to her presence. She also recounted how teams, including her former Phoenix Mercury squad, specifically targeted Clark with aggressive play during her rookie season, suggesting the treatment she receives is excessive. Cunningham's comments highlight the ongoing debate surrounding Clark's influence and the intense on-court reception she has faced since entering the league.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's move to revive the presidential fitness test brings back a program initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956 over concerns about the physical preparedness of American youth compared to Europeans. The test, which evolved over the years, typically included a one-mile run, sit-ups, and pull-ups to assess overall fitness. This article provides historical context, noting Eisenhower's original motivation was linked to national security and combat readiness. It also points to a recent report suggesting that child health metrics in the U.S. have worsened since the test was discontinued, raising questions about its potential effectiveness today.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the earning potential of depositing $20,000 into either a high-yield savings account or a money market account in the current interest rate climate. Based on current average rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.44% APY would earn slightly more over a year ($24 more) than a money market account at 4.32% APY. However, the piece notes that rates are variable and the difference is minimal. It suggests that savers should also consider other features, such as the check-writing capabilities of money market accounts, to determine the best fit for their financial needs.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, part of a larger force sent by the Trump administration to manage protests against federal immigration policies. The deployment, which was met with strong opposition from California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, was criticized for pulling troops from other essential duties. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, the withdrawal is seen as a victory by local politicians who argued that protest management should be handled by local law enforcement, marking a de-escalation of federal presence.</p>

          <p>In a significant U-turn, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's parliament have overturned a law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after days of large-scale protests, primarily led by young Ukrainians who argued that protecting these institutions was vital for the nation's path toward EU integration. The demonstrations, the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion, successfully pressured the government to backtrack. The event is seen as a victory for Ukraine's civil society but has raised questions about Zelensky's commitment to anti-corruption reforms.</p>
