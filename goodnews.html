          <h2>Trump Administration Extends EU Tariff Deadline to July 9</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9, following a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump cited a "very nice call" with von der Leyen, who indicated that the EU is ready to advance trade talks swiftly but needs additional time to reach a good deal. The extension aims to provide more time for negotiations between the U.S. and the EU to avoid a potential trade war, as Trump has previously expressed frustration with the pace of discussions and threatened to increase tariffs. This decision follows earlier announcements of tariff pauses and reductions to allow for negotiations, with the EU reiterating its commitment to securing a fair trade agreement based on mutual respect. Optimism score is based on the avoidance of potential trade war.</p>

          <p>Alex Palou has become the first driver from Spain to win the Indianapolis 500, defeating former Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Marcus Ericsson. Palou, who has won three IndyCar titles in four years, came to the speedway with four wins through the first five races. Two-time defending race winner Josef Newgarden had carved his way through traffic from starting on the last row into the top-10 by the 80th lap of the race. The bizarre only continued as Alexander Rossi went to pit road with smoke coming from the back of his car, only for it to erupt into flames and his fueler caught fire.</p>

          <p>Wendy Cutler, Vice-President of the Asia Society Policy Institute, draws on her extensive experience in shaping US trade policy to assess the current US-China trade relationship. Despite a recent truce and tariff reductions, Cutler anticipates continued fluctuations in bilateral relations. While progress is being made on issues such as fentanyl, she foresees significant challenges in finding common ground on concerns like excess capacity, subsidies, and transshipments within the limited 90-day negotiation period. The analyst cautions that achieving a lasting agreement will require addressing complex and deeply rooted issues.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert introduces 'emotionally safe parenting' as a new approach to raising highly successful children, emphasizing the importance of emotional attunement and creating a safe space for children to express their feelings. This parenting style focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open communication, while setting clear boundaries and encouraging independence. Emotionally safe parents prioritize accepting their child's emotions without judgment, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support, ultimately creating an environment where children feel safe to be their authentic selves.</p>
