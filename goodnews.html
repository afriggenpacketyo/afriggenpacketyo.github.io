CEO Michael Dell made this commitment during a roundtable event at the White House with President Trump, while Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan. The program, previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. The provision to create the accounts passed the House last month as part of the major tax-cut bill that Trump is pushing Republicans to send to his desk before the Fourth of July (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. This approval provides doctors with another option to combat RSV, a virus that causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants annually. Merck anticipates orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments before the RSV season starts. The shot reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreased hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared with a placebo among infants through five months, according to mid- to late-stage trials.</p>

The price of silver is rising, with analysts predicting a potential increase to $40 per ounce by the end of the year. Silver has industrial properties that could increase its value, and it can diversify a portfolio and hedge against inflation. Experts recommend limiting precious metal investments to 10% of an overall portfolio, dividing it between gold and silver if considering both (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition relies heavily on critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, but their uneven distribution across the world raises concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. The United States is a major consumer but not a significant producer of these minerals, leading to efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials to reduce reliance on critical minerals.</p>
