          <p>Following Morgan Stanley's downgrade of CrowdStrike to "equal weight," CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a bullish counter-opinion, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley cited the cybersecurity firm's high valuation after a 50% stock rise since April, suggesting its growth potential is already priced in. Cramer, however, remains confident in the company's strong second-half outlook, particularly as customer deals made after a 2024 IT glitch expire. The article notes that while concerns over valuation and potential federal budget cuts exist, many investors still see CrowdStrike as a long-term leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On a challenging Bastille Day stage in the Tour de France, British cyclist Simon Yates secured a victory in stage 10 after a strategic attack on the final climb. The stage, which featured eight categorized climbs through the Massif Central, saw a large breakaway group get significantly reduced. Meanwhile, Ben Healy finished third, which was enough to propel him into the overall lead, making him the first Irish rider in 38 years to wear the coveted yellow jersey. Defending champion Tadej Pogacar sits in second place in the general classification, 29 seconds behind Healy.</p>

          <p>Despite the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), some prospective parents with disabilities still encounter discrimination from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida, who were initially rejected by an agency due to their condition. They eventually adopted a child, Hadley, who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The case underscores the ongoing challenges for disabled individuals in accessing services like adoption, even when they are well-equipped to be parents.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its Tennessee plant to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells for electric vehicles. This technology is significantly cheaper than standard lithium-ion batteries because it does not rely on expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. GM aims to scale production of these lower-cost cells to diversify its EV portfolio, which currently spans a wide price range. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027, supporting the automaker's broader push into more affordable electric vehicle options.</p>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to boost the private jet market by reinstating "bonus depreciation," allowing businesses to write off 100% of a jet's purchase price in the first year. This tax incentive, which applies to new and used jets placed in service for business use, is reviving a provision from the 2017 tax cuts. Jet brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the legislation to pass. The stimulus comes as the private jet industry has seen growth slow from its post-pandemic peak, with a rising inventory of pre-owned jets on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of current certificate of deposit (CD) rates reveals that while short-term CDs currently offer higher annual percentage yields (APYs), long-term CDs generate substantially more total interest over their full term. For a $5,000 deposit, a 5-year CD at 4.20% would earn over $1,140, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% earns $220. The unusual rate inversion is attributed to banks hedging against potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. The choice between them depends on a saver's goals: maximizing total returns versus maintaining flexibility to reinvest sooner. (not investment advice)</p>
