          <p>Dolly Fox, Charlie Sheen's ex-girlfriend, has publicly supported Sheen's claim that then-Governor Bill Clinton showed interest in her during a 1987 movie set visit. In his memoir, Sheen wrote that Clinton whispered to an aide to "find out what you can about the brunette," referring to Fox. Fox, however, downplayed the incident, describing Clinton as "never creepy" and emphasizing that it was a harmless flirtation common in the 80s. She also highlighted long-standing family ties with the Clintons and Monica Lewinsky's mother, adding an unexpected layer of connection to the story. This article offers a celebrity's perspective on a past encounter, contextualized by the woman involved.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Debt Relief Programs and Credit Counseling in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:38:06 EDT</div>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching $1.21 trillion, many Americans are seeking ways to regain financial control, often considering debt relief programs or credit counseling. Debt relief, encompassing settlement or consolidation, aims to reduce the total amount owed, potentially offering faster resolution but carrying higher risks and credit score impacts. Conversely, credit counseling emphasizes education, budgeting, and structured repayment plans over three to five years, generally resulting in a milder credit impact. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of these two approaches, detailing their mechanisms, costs, credit implications, and timelines to help individuals make informed decisions for their financial recovery.

          <p>Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) experienced a significant 15% increase, closing up on Friday following a report that the video game company is nearing a substantial $50 billion deal to go private. Investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, are reportedly involved, with an announcement potentially scheduled for next week. If completed, this leveraged buyout, which relies heavily on debt for acquisition, would mark the largest in Wall Street history, exceeding the 2007 TXU Energy agreement. EA, a developer of popular titles like The Sims and Madden NFL, has seen its stock climb approximately 32% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent U.N. General Assembly saw a distinct shift in atmosphere, marked by "anxiety and apprehension" following President Trump's cuts to billions in foreign aid. Global health leaders observed discussions occurring in "silos," with some lamenting the aid reductions while others sought new, sustainable solutions. Attendees, including the CEO of The END Fund and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's senior director, noted a deeper quality to conversations focused on collective problem-solving and transitioning away from aid dependency. Despite the challenges, a new energy emerged among participants, fostering collaborative "dreaming" for future initiatives amidst global health and economic stressors.</p>

          <h2>Potential Savings from Debt Forgiveness on a $20,000 Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:45:33 EDT</div>

          <p>With average credit card debt reaching $6,500 and interest rates over 21%, a $20,000 balance can lead to tens of thousands in interest over decades. This article explores how credit card debt forgiveness, or settlement, could significantly reduce such a burden. Successful settlements typically cut 30% to 50% of the original debt, potentially saving $6,000 to $10,000 on a $20,000 balance and resolving it within three to five years, compared to eight years and $22,000 in interest with minimum payments. While not guaranteed and impacting credit scores, settlement offers a powerful, albeit risky, path to debt reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Calculating Monthly Payments for a $20,000 Home Equity Loan After Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:45:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly payments for a $20,000 home equity loan have seen only a marginal decrease, ranging from about $194 to $246 for 15-year and 10-year terms respectively. This article highlights that while the impact of rate cuts has been muted, home equity loans remain an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards, thanks to fixed interest rates. Borrowers can also benefit from potential tax deductions if funds are used for eligible home repairs. This financial article emphasizes the strategic advantages of home equity loans, advising careful calculation for long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC stations, ending a preemption that followed remarks made by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sinclair, which owns 38 ABC affiliates, had joined Nexstar in temporarily replacing the late-night show with other programming, even after Disney's ABC network brought it back. The company stated its objective was to ensure "accurate and engaging" programming for its audience while honoring network obligations. Nexstar, operating about 30 ABC affiliates, has not yet indicated its plans, highlighting ongoing negotiations and diverse approaches to network content.</p>

          <p>Grammy-nominated hip-hop producer Metro Boomin, Leland Tyler Wayne, has been found not liable in a civil sexual assault lawsuit after a federal jury ruled in his favor on all four claims. The lawsuit, initiated by Vanessa LeMaistre in October 2024, had alleged sexual assault and impregnation. Wayne's legal team consistently dismissed the accusations as "frivolous and unequivocally false," a sentiment echoed by the producer who described the case as a "pure shakedown." Despite the verdict, Wayne expressed profound relief at moving past "this nonsense," while also lamenting the significant financial and personal toll the year-long litigation had taken on him and his family. LeMaistre's attorney voiced disappointment and indicated intentions to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A remarkably rare orange lobster, dubbed "Jean-Clawed Van Damme," was successfully rescued from a New York supermarket and subsequently released into the open waters of the Long Island Sound. This extraordinary catch, estimated to be a one-in-30-million occurrence, was discovered by shopper Kyle Brancato, who noticed its vibrant color among the other lobsters. Believing it might be mistaken for diseased, Brancato purchased it with the intention of freeing it. With the assistance of Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, the lobster was safely returned to its natural habitat, a poignant event that coincided with the eve of National Lobster Day.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Apsana Begum have been readmitted as Labour MPs, concluding their year-long suspension for rebelling against the government's two-child benefit cap. These two were part of a group of seven left-wing MPs who voted against scrapping the cap shortly after Labour's significant 2024 election victory. The Labour Party has recently adopted a more flexible position on the controversial cap, which restricts welfare payments for families with more than two children and would cost an estimated £3.5 billion to abolish. Begum, upon her return, criticized the party's practice of suspending MPs for conscience votes, hinting at ongoing internal debates within Labour.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, after clinching their 12th division title in 13 years, reflect on a "tough year" filled with injuries, slumps, and bullpen collapses, which some attribute to a "World Series hangover." Manager Dave Roberts and players acknowledge the physical and mental toll of repeating as champions, a feat not achieved since the Yankees' three-peat in 1998-2000. Despite the adversity, the team believes these challenges have "battle-tested" them, fostering connection and preparing them for the postseason. This article explores the psychological and physical hurdles faced by defending champions and the Dodgers' readiness for October baseball.</p>
