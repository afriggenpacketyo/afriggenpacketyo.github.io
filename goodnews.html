          <p>Senator Susan Collins voiced concerns regarding President Trump's intention to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar to be converted into Air Force One, citing potential political espionage, ethical issues, and constitutional problems. Collins emphasized the need for a thorough security sweep to detect any implanted listening devices, which would be time-consuming. She questioned the rationale behind pursuing this option, especially given Boeing's delays in producing a new presidential plane, suggesting that a gift jet is not the appropriate solution. Collins highlighted the frustration with Boeing but maintained that security and ethical considerations should take precedence. </p>

          <p>Coinbase has confirmed that the SEC is investigating whether the company misstated its user numbers, specifically the "verified users" metric, which it reported as over 100 million. The investigation, initiated during the Biden administration and continuing under the Trump administration's SEC, focuses on the accuracy of this metric, which includes anyone who verified their email or phone number. Coinbase's chief legal officer stated that the company believes the investigation should not continue, as they stopped reporting the metric two and a half years ago and disclosed its potential to overstate unique customers.

Despite a 7% year-on-year increase in revenue, analysts had hoped that investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce would drive stronger results. The company is facing challenges from macroeconomic volatility in China, including the trade war with the U.S., which has impacted consumer sentiment.

          <p>President Trump's approach to US-Israel relations appears to be diverging from traditional support on wider regional issues, despite maintaining strong pro-Israel rhetoric. Trump's current trip to the Middle East notably excludes a stop in Israel, and his administration has engaged in direct negotiations with Israel's adversaries without coordination. This shift reflects a broader trend within the Republican party towards reducing military involvement in the Middle East and prioritizing US interests. While maintaining support for Israel's defense, Trump seems less concerned with aligning US and Israeli strategies in the region.</p>

          <p>Seniors may find value in exploring key insurance policies this spring to enhance their financial protection, especially given economic uncertainties. Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance can provide financial support for nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed against and provides a benefit to beneficiaries after death. Acting sooner rather than later can potentially secure more coverage at lower premiums, as prices tend to increase with age. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The research also found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to the foundation of distinct Indigenous groups in South America.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has concluded its case against Meta, arguing that the social media giant illegally monopolized social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC presented internal documents and questioned executives to prove that Meta bought rival apps to neutralize competitive threats. The government also argued that Instagram could have thrived and created more competition if Meta had not acquired it. Meta is expected to mount a defense, arguing that it competes with a wide range of social media companies.</p>
