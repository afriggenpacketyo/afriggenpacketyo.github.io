        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally requested UEFA to investigate potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules concerning Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. Crystal Palace qualified by winning the FA Cup, but UEFA rules prevent an individual or entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. John Textor, owner of Eagle Football, holds a 43% stake in Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, also qualified for the Europa League. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League, could benefit if Palace is disqualified, potentially moving up to the Europa League. </p>
