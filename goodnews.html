          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, triumphing over American JJ Spaun in a dramatic sudden-death playoff at the St Jude Championship in Memphis. The victory was sealed on the third extra hole when Rose carded a birdie that Spaun could not match, concluding a nail-biting finish. This win represents a significant return to form for the 45-year-old world number 20, providing a stark contrast to the disappointment for compatriot Tommy Fleetwood. Fleetwood had entered the final round with the lead but ultimately finished one shot shy of the playoff, extending his quest for a first victory on the American circuit.</p>

          <p>During a game between the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros, broadcasters Michael Kay and Paul O'Neill delighted fans with numerous jokes and references to the sitcom 'Seinfeld'. The humor was prompted by the fact that the Astros' starting pitcher was named Jason Alexander, the same as the actor who famously played George Costanza. The announcers incorporated famous lines from the show into their commentary and scouting report, creating a memorable and lighthearted broadcast. Former Yankee Paul O'Neill, who once guest-starred on 'Seinfeld', even shared anecdotes about his appearance, adding a layer of nostalgic fun to the baseball game, which the Astros ultimately won.</p>

The daughter of Hollywood legends Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, she spoke about initially wanting to be a police officer before unexpectedly landing an acting contract. Curtis reflected on key roles in films like "Trading Places" and "True Lies," her struggles with addiction after a negative experience with plastic surgery, and her decision to prioritize family by taking on commercial work. Now sober for 26 years, she champions authenticity and has found freedom in embracing imperfection, surpassing her parents' legacies by her own emotional and professional standards.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from specific chips sold to China. This deal will grant the companies export licenses to sell Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The agreement highlights the White House's strategy of using exceptions to its tariff and export control policies as a bargaining tool amid ongoing economic tensions with Beijing. The move follows a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump, underscoring the high-stakes negotiations shaping the global semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading historian Rana Mitter, an expert on modern China, posits that the Second World War was a pivotal, yet frequently underestimated, event in shaping the nation's contemporary trajectory. Speaking on the 80th anniversary of the war, Mitter highlights that the conflict had a devastating impact on China, shattering much of the infrastructure and communications that had been developed in the preceding decades. This destruction forced the country into a position of having to rebuild almost from scratch in the post-war era. Mitter's analysis suggests that understanding this historical context is crucial for comprehending China's subsequent political and societal development, as well as its current interests in a peaceful Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive, ruling that commercial fishing remains illegal within the protected waters of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections, effectively halting fishing in a vast area rich with coral reefs, seabirds, and marine mammals. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public process for changing the rules. The ruling is being celebrated as a major victory for the preservation of one of the planet's most vital and pristine marine ecosystems.</p>

          <h2>Arne Slot's Revamped Liverpool Shows Flashes of Brilliance and Defensive Flaws in Season Opener</h2>

          <p>Liverpool's new-look team under manager Arne Slot made its debut in the Community Shield, ending in a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace. The match showcased the potential of new signings, with debut goals from striker Hugo Ekitike and full-back Jeremie Frimpong, and a standout performance from record acquisition Florian Wirtz in midfield. However, the game also exposed defensive vulnerabilities, as Liverpool twice surrendered leads and looked shaky at the back, a continuation of issues seen in preseason. Slot acknowledged that his revamped squad needs time to adapt, but the early signs suggest a team capable of spectacular attacking football alongside clear defensive weaknesses that need addressing.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed delivered a star performance with both bat and ball to guide the Trent Rockets to a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers in the men's Hundred competition. The 20-year-old first took two key wickets to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs during the chase, stabilizing the innings after the Rockets' spinners had caused a middle-order wobble. Despite a tense finish, the Rockets successfully reached their target with four balls remaining, maintaining their unbeaten start to the tournament thanks to Ahmed's decisive contributions in both facets of the game.</p>
