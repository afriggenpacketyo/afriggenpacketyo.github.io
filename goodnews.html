          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a composed and formal approach, a contrast to a previous tense encounter. The summit, which included leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and the EU, was framed as an intervention to guide President Trump's peace negotiations with Russia. The presence of European leaders helped keep discussions focused, preventing major diplomatic flare-ups while navigating Trump's unpredictable style and pronouncements on ending the war.</p>

Despite this positive development, officials warn that continued vigilance is necessary due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S., fueled by declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>A review of the musical "& Juliet" praises the production as a "euphoric dance party" that rewrites Shakespeare's classic tragedy. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a new life in Paris, set to a soundtrack of hit songs from producer Max Martin. The article highlights the musical's witty script by David West Read and energetic performances, which combine to create a feel-good experience centered on female empowerment and second chances.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>

          <p>This article explores the age-related factors involved in purchasing annuities, a financial product offering guaranteed retirement income. While there are no federal age limits, most insurance companies impose their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old. The best time to buy depends on individual financial strategy, as purchasing at an older age can result in higher monthly payments but also carries the risk of reduced product availability or disqualification due to health.

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the network's broadcasting of false claims about the 2020 presidential election.

Despite the large payment, Newsmax did not apologize and stated it stood by its coverage, a resolution similar to Fox News's earlier $787.5 million settlement with Dominion.</p>
