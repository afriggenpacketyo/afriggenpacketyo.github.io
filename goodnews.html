          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move expected to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. The loans, taken in 2014 and 2015 from the Export-Import Bank of China, financed the Standard Gauge Railway. As of June 2024, about US$3.5 billion remained unpaid, with Kenya spending US$1 billion annually on servicing its Chinese debt. The new yuan loan is expected to halve the existing 6.37% interest rate under the dollar-denominated agreement, potentially drawing other debt-stressed African countries closer to China. This financial restructuring aims to alleviate Kenya's debt burden and foster stronger economic ties with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walk-on King Miller's standout performance propelled USC to a significant 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan after injuries depleted the team's backfield. Miller, previously low on the depth chart, rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown, breaking open the game in the third quarter. USC's defense also improved, holding Michigan's quarterback Bryce Underwood to 207 passing yards and limiting their rushing attack. The win marks a crucial turnaround for USC after a previous loss and a positive sign for coach Lincoln Riley. The performance raises questions about whether USC will offer Miller a scholarship.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Concerns About Facing Brewers in NLCS</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are preparing to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, and there are several concerns they should consider. The Brewers have a significantly smaller payroll but compensate with a small-ball approach, excelling in batting average, walks, and stolen bases. Their pitching staff is also strong, ranking high in team ERA and strikeouts, led by veteran Freddy Peralta. The Brewers swept the Dodgers in two series earlier in the season, highlighting their ability to challenge the Dodgers' offense and pitching. The Dodgers will need to address these factors to succeed in the NLCS. </p>

          <p>President Trump is directing US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure military personnel are paid despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Trump stated that he would not allow Democrats to hold the military hostage and instructed Hegseth to use all available funds to pay troops on October 15. This directive comes as other government employees face withheld pay and potential layoffs due to the shutdown. Trump blames Democrats for failing to agree on a spending plan, while Democrats insist on preserving healthcare tax credits and reversing Medicaid cuts. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that democracies must adopt stronger mechanisms to protect climate policy from political cycles and populist erosion, highlighting a crisis of confidence in global energy investment. Companies have cancelled or scaled back clean energy projects due to eroding political will and leaders walking back commitments. Populist pressures are dismantling policy frameworks that made the transition viable, with leaders exploiting the disconnect between immediate costs and deferred benefits. The article suggests that democracies need to create enduring climate policies that are insulated from short-term political pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
