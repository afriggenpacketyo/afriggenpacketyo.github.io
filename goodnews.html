          <p>This NPR article reports on the reopening of the Damascus Securities Exchange after a six-month closure, signaling an effort by Syria's new leaders to revitalize the country's economy following years of civil war. The move coincides with the easing of international financial restrictions on Syria by the United States and Europe. Additionally, Syria has signed a $7 billion power deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and U.S. companies to develop a large-scale energy project aimed at rebuilding the nation's electricity grid. The reopening of the stock exchange and the energy deal reflect a broader strategy to attract investment and stimulate economic growth in Syria.</p>
