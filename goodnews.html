        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances in the United States. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the EBDPA, which would allow research to catch up with the increasing cannabis consumption. Experts suggest this could help policymakers craft effective legislation and allow more clinical research on medical cannabis. While the Biden administration pushed for cannabis rescheduling, the EBDPA would repeal sections that forbid federal funds for research on Schedule I substances.</p>
