          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician who exposed Flint's water crisis, has created Rx Kids, a program providing cash to pregnant mothers in Flint, Michigan, aiming to combat the effects of poverty. The program provides $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 a month for up to a year after birth, with no strings attached. Dr. Hanna has raised over $100 million, mostly from private donors, and reports indicate families are using the money for baby supplies, food, rent, and utilities. The program is being praised for its efficiency and ability to directly help families in need, with plans to expand it to other communities across the nation.</p>

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates suggests that global investors are reevaluating their portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. This shift is seen as a way to "provide defense" amid geopolitical tensions, particularly with the U.S. The firm notes that despite Trump's tariffs, Asian equities, particularly Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, have outperformed. Valuations in these markets are attractive compared to U.S. stocks, making a case for diversifying away from U.S. equities even stronger, as institutional portfolios are starting to tilt away from US markets.

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the remaining crypto enforcement actions initiated by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal symbolizes the end of an aggressive crypto crackdown and coincides with the Trump administration's effort to show support for the industry. Binance is taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the World Liberty team. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, Musk's team faced criticism for unlawfully accessing sensitive data and firing federal employees, ultimately failing to deliver on its ambitious goals.
