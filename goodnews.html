          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 09:31:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is adjusting welfare reforms to alleviate concerns among Labour MPs regarding planned disability benefit cuts. Changes include a 13-week transitional payment period for those losing Personal Independence Payment (Pip), instead of the usual four weeks. Carer's allowance will continue during this transition, and benefits recipients with severe health conditions will not be reassessed, receiving extra income support. A scheme allowing disabled individuals to try employment without losing benefits will also be introduced, with Kendall emphasizing these protections as "non-negotiable."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections, siding with Democratic state attorneys general who argued it was unconstitutional. The order sought to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general argued that the directive "usurps the States‚Äô constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat."</p>

          <p>England has recalled left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone for their five-match T20 series against India. Ecclestone, who had been taking a break from domestic cricket to prioritize her wellbeing, will replace leg-spinner Sarah Glenn in the 14-player squad. The India series will be Ecclestone's first time representing England since January's Ashes defeat in Australia. The series is England's last before the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka from late September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright says the company has reduced its hiring time by 75% using an AI hiring platform called Ava Cado. The platform, built by Paradox, automates tasks such as chatting with candidates, answering questions, scheduling interviews, and sending offers. This efficiency could help Chipotle open more than 300 locations this year. While AI can streamline hiring processes, there are potential downsides, such as cybersecurity risks and the impersonal nature of chatbot interactions.</p>

Ishiba vowed to collaborate with other G7 members to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. He emphasized the need for restraint from all parties and pledged to address Japan's position on the issue at the upcoming G7 summit in Canada.

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. The challenge argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The government welcomed the judgment, stating that the policy would generate ¬£1.8 billion annually to support pupils in state schools. The court found that while the legislation interferes with some human rights, the government was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services.</p>

Badenoch claimed that the tax is detrimental to the oil and gas industry, especially given the lack of windfall profits in recent months.

The expert highlights that many dads face challenges such as divorce, incarceration, or mental health issues that impact their ability to be present. Instead, offering support and recognizing their importance can make a significant difference. Fostering a culture of compassion and understanding can help rewrite the narrative surrounding fathers, especially those who are struggling.</p>
