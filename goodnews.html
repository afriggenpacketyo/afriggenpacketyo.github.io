          <p>Shares for retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant 25% jump after the company credited celebrity partnerships for a strong quarterly performance. The firm's ad campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce were cited as key drivers for exceeding sales expectations. Despite some controversy surrounding the Sweeney campaign, which sparked public debate, the company stated the promotions led to increased customer awareness and engagement. This positive momentum has set an optimistic tone for the upcoming fall season.</p>

Despite the equity gains, concerns remain in the global bond markets, with long-term borrowing costs under pressure. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5%, indicating underlying economic anxieties for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in China, has introduced a new stimulus measure offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) for hosting large banquets. The policy is designed to encourage consumer spending in the catering sector as part of a broader effort to boost the local economy amid strained national growth. This initiative reflects the challenge local officials face in promoting consumption while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. The city hopes these measures will generate significant additional consumer spending this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in federal research funding for Harvard University. The administration had justified the freeze by citing allegations of antisemitism on campus, but Judge Allison D. Burroughs concluded this was a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling protects over 900 research projects in critical fields like medicine and science, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease. The White House has stated its intention to immediately appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the industrial food system by adopting sustainable practices and a direct-to-consumer model. Facing threats from big agriculture and extreme weather, the Mannix family co-founded the Old Salt Co-op, a partnership of ranches committed to regenerative land management. This approach involves rotating cattle to allow land to rest and recover, which improves soil health and increases grass production even in dry years. By processing their meat locally and selling through their own butcher shop and restaurants, they aim to build a resilient, local food system.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the UK's main federation of trade unions, is publicly calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to explore a range of wealth taxes in the upcoming November Budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak suggested taxes on windfall profits from banks, online gaming companies, and equalizing capital gains tax with income tax. The proposal aims to generate revenue to boost investment in public services, a key issue for the Labour government. The Treasury responded by stating that its primary focus remains on growing the economy, setting the stage for a significant policy debate.</p>

          <p>Drawing from personal experience as both a former police detective and a recent accident victim, an article provides a practical guide on what to do immediately after a car crash. The first crucial step is to stop the car and turn off the engine, followed by checking for any injuries to yourself and passengers. If possible, the vehicle should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on. The guide stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the accident is blocking traffic.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups have successfully negotiated an agreement with the Department of Justice to prevent about 98,000 North Carolina voters from being disenfranchised. The DOJ had sued the state to block voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial Social Security number. The settlement allows these voters to provide the missing information using a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue. This outcome is seen as a victory for voting rights advocates against the Trump administration's DOJ.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova secured a place in her first US Open semi-final with a decisive 6-4, 6-3 victory over second-seeded Iga Swiatek.

Anisimova displayed fearless and aggressive play from the baseline, overcoming an early break to control the match's tempo. The victory is a significant career milestone for the 24-year-old, who is now the first American woman since the Williams sisters to reach the semifinals on all three Grand Slam surfaces.</p>

          <p>Five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed by parents over educational standards during remote learning. The agreement will provide at least 45 hours of high-dose tutoring per year to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. While the settlement is a victory for advocates, the lengthy litigation means the support comes too late for students who were in high school when the pandemic began and have since graduated.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock jump 9% after a federal judge issued a ruling in its landmark antitrust case that spared the company from the most severe potential penalty. While finding Google to be a monopolist in online search, the judge decided against forcing a sale of its popular Chrome web browser, calling such a remedy "incredibly messy and highly risky." The court did, however, impose other limits, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help restore competition in the market.</p>
