          <p>A review of BBC Sport pundits' Premier League predictions reveals that none accurately predicted Liverpool's title win. Opta's supercomputer, using a complex algorithm, favored Manchester City, though it correctly identified all top-four teams. Fara Williams was one of the few BBC pundits to include all top-four teams in her predictions. The article highlights the difficulty in accurately forecasting Premier League outcomes despite data analysis and punditry.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the Canadian parliament, a move seen as a statement of Canada's sovereignty against threats from US President Donald Trump. The invitation signals a shift towards a more supportive stance of the Crown compared to previous Liberal governments. The visit aims to improve relations with Trump, who admires the monarchy, and strengthen ties with Europe as Canada navigates its relationship with the US. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, the visit serves as a political message of Canada's unique identity.</p>
