          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence, allocating billions to recruit top talent and bolster Meta's AI capabilities. This follows criticism of Meta's Llama 4 AI models and aims to position the company as a leader in the AI revolution. Meta's strategy involves integrating AI across its platforms, from advertising to the metaverse, and competing with industry giants like Google and OpenAI. Zuckerberg's past acquisitions, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, suggest a similar bold approach to dominating the AI landscape, though this strategy is putting pressure on him to deliver results for shareholders. The company is spending large amounts of money to hire away talent from competitors. Optimism is tempered by the challenges of competing in a rapidly evolving AI market.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning to visit Japan in late August to discuss a bullet train deal and enhance security cooperation. The two leaders are expected to finalize India's adoption of Japan's next-generation shinkansen bullet train for a high-speed rail project connecting Ahmedabad and Mumbai. They may also revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their partnership amid China's increasing maritime influence. This visit aims to strengthen communication between India and Japan ahead of a four-way summit with the United States and Australia under the Quad framework, which New Delhi is scheduled to host in the fall. The high-speed rail line is considered a symbol of Japan-India cooperation, utilizing Japan's renowned shinkansen technology.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention by providing personalized healthcare and early warnings for potential health issues. The scheme is part of a broader government effort to invest ¬£650 million in DNA research by 2030, with the goal of predicting and preventing illness. While experts acknowledge the potential benefits of early disease detection, concerns have been raised about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data and provide appropriate counseling to patients. The health secretary believes that this technology will transform the NHS into a service that proactively prevents ill-health, reducing pressure on its services and improving public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>A heatwave is intensifying across the UK, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, accompanied by a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales. The Met Office has issued the warning due to the potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and frequent lightning. An amber heat-health alert is also in effect, with concerns about pressure on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths. While the heatwave is record-breaking for 2025, temperatures remain below the June peak of 1976, and climate change is generally making heatwaves hotter and longer, increasing the risk of wildfires. The public is urged to take precautions and look out for vulnerable individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths following a 2010 export ban. By investing in non-China rare-earth projects, such as Australia's Lynas, and promoting recycling and alternative technologies, Japan has decreased its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. This approach serves as a template for Western nations facing similar challenges, as China's dominance in critical minerals poses a strategic risk. However, Japan still faces challenges in cutting its dependency on China in some key areas, particularly for heavy rare earth elements, underscoring the difficulty of escaping China's critical mineral orbit. The recent export curbs implemented by China have further highlighted the need for diversification and alternative supply sources.</p>

Suga started his service in 2023 and completed his duty as a social service agent, with his discharge not publicly celebrated due to overcrowding concerns. After his release, Suga thanked fans for their support and apologized for a drunk driving incident from the previous year. The discharge of all BTS members has sparked anticipation for the group's comeback, which has been on hiatus since 2022, and is expected to hold its largest-ever world tour in 2026.
