          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise in a dispute involving Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, granting the company a temporary exemption from import taxes. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tariff-free for six months in early 2026 as it establishes its new local factory. However, the government also moved to accelerate tariff hikes in the long run, with levies on EV kits rising to 35% by January 2027. The decision balances BYD's request for relief with pressure from domestic automakers who warned that a broader exemption could threaten local jobs and investment.</p>

According to the White House, the envoys will meet with local Gazans to understand the dire situation firsthand. They will then brief President Trump to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution, an effort described by the administration as a humanitarian mission to save lives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 13:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest ever found in Australia. The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. Researchers suggest its large body mass likely evolved over millions of years to help it survive in the colder, high-altitude canopy environment. The insect's discovery was aided by its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum's collection to facilitate further scientific research on this unique creature.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 13:36:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) into an annuity is a wise financial move for pre-retirees in the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility. While annuities can provide a guaranteed, predictable income stream, which is appealing for risk-averse individuals, they also come with potential downsides like high fees and limited liquidity. The decision depends heavily on individual circumstances, including one's proximity to retirement, risk tolerance, and the need for a stable income versus investment growth potential. A partial rollover is presented as a possible compromise for balancing security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its plan to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, particularly for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had previously announced it would phase out the data flow as part of a modernization effort, sparking concern among scientists who warned it could lead to less accurate storm forecasts. Following feedback from government partners, officials found a way to continue providing the data until at least September 2026. This information is vital for issuing timely warnings for storms and for monitoring sea ice, which impacts global weather patterns and climate change research.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have made a significant move to bolster their pitching staff by acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller from the Oakland Athletics. The trade also brings left-handed pitcher JP Sears to San Diego in exchange for a package of four prospects, including highly-rated shortstop Leo De Vries. Miller, known for his 101mph fastball, has 20 saves this season and is under team control through 2029, making him a valuable long-term asset. This blockbuster deal aims to strengthen the Padres' position as they contend for a National League wildcard spot in the current MLB season.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, significantly reducing the military presence established two months ago. The troops were deployed by President Trump to manage public unrest related to federal immigration raids. California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, had fiercely contested the deployment as an unnecessary and illegal use of federal power that inflamed local tensions. Newsom's office declared the withdrawal a sign that the president's "political theater backfired," while about 250 Guard members will remain to protect federal facilities in the city.</p>

          <p>A line of plush monster dolls called Labubu, created by the China-based company Pop Mart, is experiencing a surge in popularity in the United States. Initially gaining traction in China, the collectible dolls are now a trending fashion accessory, seen attached to purses and belts and promoted by celebrities like Lisa from Blackpink. This craze has significantly boosted Pop Mart's revenue, with North American sales climbing approximately 900% in the first quarter of 2025. Analysts have dubbed Labubu a "gateway drug" to the company's other products, transforming it from a toymaker into a broader cultural and fashion phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, demonstrated significant heart health benefits in a head-to-head clinical trial with its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and, notably, showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause compared to Trulicity. While the primary goal was to prove it was not inferior, these additional benefits bolster the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results could further solidify Mounjaro's market position as Trulicity's patent expiration approaches.</p>

The design software company, which recently priced its IPO at $33 per share for a valuation of $19.3 billion, is moving forward after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory objections.</p>
