          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, beginning on Sunday. Forecasters estimate a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 expected to become hurricanes, and three to five potentially becoming major hurricanes. The article includes a list of the names assigned to tropical storms and hurricanes for the year, which are rotated annually by the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency. Storm names are retired if a storm is particularly deadly or costly, and the 2024 season saw 18 named storms and hurricanes, with three names retired.</p>

          <p>Presenter and campaigner Katie Piper spoke at the Hay Festival in Wales about ageing, comparing it to a bereavement and noting how women age out of the male gaze. Piper, who experienced a life-altering attack at 24, discussed her book, "Still Beautiful: On Age, Beauty and Owning Your Space," where she explores societal judgment and the power women hold beyond youth and conventional beauty standards. She emphasizes the importance of self-acceptance and taking control of one's destiny, viewing ageing as a key to letting go of external expectations, and she also touched on the discrimination she has faced due to her appearance, highlighting the need to recognize the inherent goodness in people.</p>
