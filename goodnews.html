          <p>Japanese snowboarder Tomoka Takeuchi, a six-time Olympian, has announced she will retire at the end of the 2025-26 Olympic season. Takeuchi, who won a silver medal in parallel giant slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, has already met the qualifying standards set by the Ski Association of Japan for the upcoming Milan-Cortina Olympics. The 41-year-old Hokkaido native made her Olympic debut in 2002 and took a break from competition after the 2018 Olympics before returning for the 2022 Beijing Olympics, where she finished 15th in the parallel giant slalom. Takeuchi expressed her determination to give her all in her final season and strive for victory.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal, criticizing the ruling as overstepping judicial authority in addressing a national emergency. The ruling was based on cases brought by small businesses and US state governments, with global markets responding positively, as stock markets in Asia rose and the US dollar gained ground.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined its plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25 billion "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth and improve pension returns. Seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, although the government is also introducing legislative measures to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms aim to consolidate local authority and defined contribution pension schemes, potentially leading to over ¬£50 billion of additional investment in UK infrastructure, housing, and businesses. The government anticipates that these changes will lead to higher returns for pension savers through reduced waste, economies of scale, and enhanced investment strategies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the expected impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also rose, increasing 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite the positive sales figures, Toyota anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. Other Japanese automakers, such as Honda and Nissan, experienced mixed results, with Honda benefiting from solid U.S. demand but Nissan facing a decline in global sales due to restructuring efforts.</p>

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has scrapped its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community, including the mayor and lawmakers. The controversial plan, presented during a Board of Education meeting, aimed to alter grading standards by prioritizing final exams and de-emphasizing homework, weekly tests, and attendance. Critics argued the changes would lower standards and fail to adequately prepare students for success, betraying the American Dream of hard work and excellence. The SFUSD Superintendent stated that no changes to grading practices have been implemented and that the district remains committed to high standards and student success.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its focus on advanced manufacturing, potentially setting the stage for conflict with the U.S. as President Trump aims to boost domestic production of high-tech goods. President Xi Jinping has emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as crucial for China's economy, a strategy that has faced criticism for contributing to global trade imbalances. While China's manufacturing sector contributed significantly to its GDP, its push for self-reliance in high-tech sectors could contradict the Trump administration's demands for addressing trade imbalances and ending state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that the U.S. will maintain high tariff rates on Chinese goods, with limited prospects for a major trade deal.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with industry leaders like OpenAI. The company's initial R1 model gained prominence for outperforming rival offerings at a lower cost and with a shorter development time, raising concerns about potential overspending by U.S. tech giants. The upgraded model, released with minimal fanfare, is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought processes. DeepSeek's advancements highlight the ongoing development of Chinese AI despite U.S. efforts to restrict access to key technologies.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, indicated that purchases of U.S. defense equipment might help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in ongoing bilateral tariff talks. Akazawa clarified that while such purchases could be within the scope of discussions, tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different principles and should not be directly mixed. Japan continues to seek the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum, as well as a "reciprocal" tariff, emphasizing that the country cannot compromise on this request.</p>
