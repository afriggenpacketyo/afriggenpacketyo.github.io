          <p>Actress Sophie Turner has expressed her firm intention to remain in her native England, stating she never wants to leave after moving back to London two years ago. Her return followed the finalization of her four-year marriage and a heated custody battle with singer Joe Jonas over their two daughters, a period she described as the "worst few days of my life." Turner emphasized the profound importance of friends and family for her overall well-being, a realization she gained after living away from them in the United States. She also highlighted how becoming a mother has significantly and positively impacted her career, bringing new depth and perspective to her acting roles.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season, setting a new single-season record for catchers in Major League Baseball and surpassing Salvador Perez's 2021 total. This remarkable achievement also marks Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game of the season, establishing a new record for switch-hitters in a single season. The 28-year-old first-time All-Star, who recently signed a six-year, $105 million contract extension, is now on pace to become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs, further solidifying his impressive standing among baseball's elite.</p>

As of Sunday evening, the storm was moving north-northeast with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, and tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its center. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen slightly through Monday before likely beginning to weaken on Tuesday, remaining safely over open waters and posing no direct threat to land. This development follows the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season, underscoring ongoing concerns about storm activity in the region.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million, making it the game's tenth-largest grand prize, after no ticket successfully matched all winning numbers in Saturday's drawing. The cash value for the upcoming Monday evening drawing is estimated at $338.6 million. While the grand prize went unclaimed, several tickets did win significant smaller prizes, including three that matched all five white balls. No one has won the Powerball jackpot since May 31, contributing to the current accumulation, and the odds of winning the top prize remain a challenging 1 in 292.2 million, fueling widespread public excitement.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer outlines his market strategy following a significant stock market rally, triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's decision was primarily influenced by a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed concerns about tariffs and inflation, prompting a shift in the Fed's calculus. Cramer dismisses the "Mag 7 versus the other 493" thinking as lazy, instead highlighting an outrageously bullish narrative for sectors related to housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, all poised to benefit from the Fed's dovish stance. He also identifies pain points in healthcare and enterprise software, while offering specific stock recommendations and warnings for the seasonally challenging month of September.

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished actor known for his memorable roles as Hesh Rabkin in 'The Sopranos' and Howard Lyman in 'The Good Wife,' has died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 96. Before his acting career, which remarkably began in his 60s, Adler spent decades behind the scenes on Broadway, involved in 53 productions as a stage manager, producer, or director, working with legendary figures like Marlene Dietrich. Adler’s late-career pivot to acting brought him consistent work for over 30 years, defying his earlier belief that he was "too goofy-looking" for the screen and demonstrating his enduring passion for the craft.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is conducting its tenth test launch of the massive Starship rocket, deploying significant upgrades and intentionally stressing the vehicle after three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures. The flight plan includes a Super Heavy booster splashdown in the Gulf after unique engine tests, and the Starship upper stage aiming for a suborbital trajectory with simulated satellite deployment and an in-space engine restart. This critical test aims to gather extensive data on structural limits and performance, which is essential for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and Elon Musk's long-term goal of Mars colonization. The program faces challenges, including the ambitious 2027 moon landing target, which many aerospace observers consider unrealistic given the number of successful flights still required.</p>

The month-long project, built on an old utility trailer, prioritized efficiency and a luxury feel despite its incredibly compact size, incorporating solar panels, a compact AC/heating unit, and a tilting bed. While Kelly doesn't live in it full-time, he has tested its resilience in a snowstorm and camped with his son, proving that creative design can make even very small spaces livable. He encourages others to prioritize their needs and consider slightly more space if comfort is key when building their own tiny homes.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to expedite the appeals process, which currently takes over a year for 51,000 cases. This initiative comes amidst increasing pressure to end reliance on asylum hotels and widespread protests across the UK. However, the Refugee Council argues that the fastest way to reduce appeals is to ensure initial decisions are correct, as approximately half of all original decisions are eventually overturned on appeal due to being flawed.</p>
