          <p>Bitcoin has continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional interest. James Butterfill of CoinShares noted that broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S., such as the GENIUS Act, and supportive comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have also boosted the cryptocurrency market.

          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are set to extend their rally of nearly 80% this year, according to analysts, driven by new models and a move toward profitability. The company's shares in Hong Kong surged following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, thanks to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock and pegs a target price significantly higher than its current price.</p>
