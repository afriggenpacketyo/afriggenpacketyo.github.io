          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, was forced to return to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas after flames and smoke were observed coming from one of its engines shortly after takeoff. The plane, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, landed safely with no reported injuries. A subsequent inspection by the airline's maintenance team found no evidence of a fire, but the Airbus A321 was taken out of service for further evaluation, and the FAA is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A controversial project to synthetically create human DNA has commenced, supported by an initial ¬£10 million investment from the Wellcome Trust. This research aims to build the building blocks of human life from scratch, potentially leading to breakthroughs in treating incurable diseases. While proponents envision therapies for healthier aging and disease-resistant cells for damaged organs, critics fear the potential for misuse, such as creating enhanced or modified humans. The project marks a significant advancement from the Human Genome Project, which mapped human DNA, by enabling scientists to create DNA molecule by molecule.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, which increases the risk of miscarriage, potentially paving the way for new treatments for recurrent pregnancy loss. The womb lining in some women doesn't transform into a supportive environment for embryo implantation, but the new test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining. A trial involving over 1,000 patients at Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research is underway, offering hope for women who have experienced repeated miscarriages.</p>

          <p>The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Mars' acquisition of Pringles' maker Kellanova, citing concerns that the deal could lead to market price increases. The European Commission's preliminary assessment suggests that the acquisition would increase Mars' bargaining power against EU retailers.

The tool, crafted from a mammoth's tusk, would not have returned to the thrower, suggesting it was likely used for hunting. Archaeologists highlight the remarkable skill of Homo sapiens from that era in shaping such a perfect object for hunting animals. The boomerang is exceptionally well-preserved, with score marks indicating it was polished and carved for use by a right-handed individual.</p>
