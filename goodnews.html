          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is at odds with Iran's nuclear program, not the country itself, following recent U.S. military strikes. Vance praised President Trump's actions and expressed gratitude to the U.S. troops involved in the mission, emphasizing the importance of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He highlighted the precision and skill of the operation, which he believes has significantly delayed Iran's nuclear ambitions, adding that the United States is open to peaceful negotiations if Iran abandons its nuclear weapons pursuit. Vance warned against any Iranian retaliation, promising an overwhelming response to any attacks on American troops.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports, noting that blocking the waterway would have severe economic consequences. He stated that the U.S. retains options to respond to any Iranian attempt to close the strait, and that such a move would be viewed as a major escalation meriting a strong response. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not the country itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear installations. While avoiding absolute confirmation of the sites' complete destruction, Vance asserted that the U.S. has substantially delayed Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. He also addressed conflicting reports regarding the damage to the Fordo enrichment plant, emphasizing the overall success in setting back Iran's nuclear ambitions. Nuclear analysts remain divided on whether the strikes will lead Iran to negotiate or accelerate its pursuit of weapons-grade uranium.</p>

          <p>Snopes investigated a rumor circulating online that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The rumor spread widely on social media and was reported by some news outlets. However, Snopes found no evidence to support the claim, and major news wire services did not report on such an announcement. The rumor likely originated from an X post, leading Snopes to conclude that it was likely false, though they did not issue a definitive fact-check rating.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley between England and India. India was building their lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close. Brook's innings included some remarkable shots, but he was eventually caught, and England was later bowled out for 465. The match is finely poised, with both teams having opportunities to gain the upper hand.</p>

Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Gulf markets showed resilience. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain gained. Egypt's EGX30 saw a significant increase. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for appeasement have helped to insulate it from significant market impact, with some viewing the removal of the Iranian threat as a positive development.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the British Prime Minister, faces a delicate diplomatic situation regarding Iran following the recent US airstrikes. Despite calls for de-escalation, the US has intervened, presenting challenges for the UK's relationship with both the US and Iran. The UK was reportedly given advanced warning of the US action but was not asked to participate, raising questions about the legality and potential future involvement. The article suggests that Starmer must navigate this situation carefully to maintain stability and protect British interests.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have revealed details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri, supported by fighter jets, refueling planes, and surveillance aircraft. The bombers dropped a total of 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on targets at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted Isfahan. Officials claim the strikes inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" and warned Iran against any retaliatory action. The mission was described as the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001.</p>
