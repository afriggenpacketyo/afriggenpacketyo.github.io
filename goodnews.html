          <p>A skydiving plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. Officials noted that despite some severe injuries and the aircraft being covered in jet fuel, it was remarkable there were no fatalities. The pilot had reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport, and an investigation is underway. The same aircraft was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, a sports column in the Los Angeles Times makes the case that Clayton Kershaw is the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting with Koufax's brilliant but shorter career. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the article points to his superior career totals in wins, innings pitched, and strikeouts. It concludes that his consistent professionalism and sustained excellence have defined a golden era for the franchise.</p>

          <p>With razor-thin margins in the U.S. House of Representatives, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more prominent. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed. This was illustrated in a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary, where a procedural move was used to allow the bill to be reconsidered later rather than letting it fail on a tie.</p>

U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to override immigration laws enacted by Congress. The order, which was a cornerstone of the administration's immigration policy, was challenged by civil liberties groups who argued it endangered vulnerable people.
