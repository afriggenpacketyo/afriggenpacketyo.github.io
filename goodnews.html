        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A concrete wall now splits the Armenian village of Kirants, a direct consequence of the 2024 border demarcation process with Azerbaijan based on old Soviet maps. While the wall has brought an end to the frequent gunfire that plagued the village during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, it has also created new hardships. Villagers have lost property and farmland, leading to economic decline and a sense of lost homeland, even as they acknowledge the newfound quiet. The demarcation process is ongoing, with only a small fraction of the border completed, leaving residents cautiously optimistic but uncertain about long-term peace and stability.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo began under grueling conditions, with temperatures climbing to 30°C and humidity exceeding 90%, posing a significant challenge for athletes. Despite the "absolutely brutal" weather, Japan celebrated its first medal in the 35km race walk, cheered on by enthusiastic home crowds who were barred from the 2020 Olympics due to the pandemic. The event marks a significant return of major sports to the city, with nearly 500,000 tickets sold, indicating strong local support. Organizers have already adjusted marathon start times due to a forecast heatwave, prioritizing athlete safety amid the extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>In a stunning high school football upset, Corona Centennial defeated the nation's top-ranked team, Mater Dei, with a final score of 43-36. Centennial dominated the first half, leading 33-7, largely due to a strong defense that forced multiple turnovers. However, Mater Dei mounted a massive comeback in the third quarter, scoring 29 unanswered points to take the lead. Centennial rallied in the final quarter, securing the win with a late touchdown and a game-clinching interception, marking Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco in a decade.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and experiencing a surge in popularity, particularly among younger generations.

Instructors and enthusiasts note a dramatic demographic shift in classes, which are now filled with teenagers and young adults. The modern revival incorporates a wide range of music genres beyond traditional country, from pop to rock, making it more accessible and breaking down long-held stereotypes about the dance form.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record-breaking pre-order sales in China, indicating strong consumer demand despite some shipment delays for the iPhone Air model. Within the first minute of availability, sales on the major e-commerce platform JD.com exceeded the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused accessibility issues on Apple's official website, with customers reporting payment processing delays. In major cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou, in-store pickup slots were quickly booked, and delivery wait times are already extending into mid-October.</p>

          <p>A Bavarian state minister has affirmed that the region remains welcoming to Chinese investment, echoing a sentiment of openness that dates back 50 years to a historic meeting between a Bavarian politician and Mao Zedong. This stance comes at a time of broader EU discussions about de-risking and building economic resilience away from China. However, the minister emphasized that protectionism is not the solution and that Bavaria continues to value its economic ties with major partners like China, the US, and Japan.
