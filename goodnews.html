          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has successfully intercepted a significant quantity of illegal narcotics in the Caribbean Sea, offloading the haul at a base in Miami Beach. The operation resulted in the seizure of approximately 2,220 pounds of cocaine and 3,320 pounds of marijuana, with an estimated street value exceeding $20 million. This successful interdiction was the outcome of four separate encounters involving a collaborative international effort with the U.S. Navy and naval forces from Canada and the Netherlands.</p>

This is only the third such interstellar visitor ever detected, following the discoveries of 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The object was spotted by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles away, posing no threat to Earth. Scientists are now racing to study the comet to learn more about the composition of other star systems before it continues its journey through the galaxy.</p>

          <p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever has been named the new CEO of his artificial intelligence startup, Safe Superintelligence. The leadership change comes after the company's previous CEO, Daniel Gross, was hired by Meta as part of its major AI talent acquisition push. Sutskever, who co-founded Safe Superintelligence with Gross and Daniel Levy, confirmed he will continue to lead the company as an independent entity, rebuffing recent acquisition rumors. Levy will now serve as the company's president, with the technical team reporting directly to Sutskever.</p>

The companies received letters from the Commerce Department rescinding the controls that had been imposed in May, which required licenses for such exports. This move, which caused shares of Synopsys and Cadence to climb, is seen as a sign of a potential trade truce between the two economic powers and follows recent signals of progress in resuming some technology exchanges.

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. For the upcoming year, federal undergraduate loans will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, while some private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer significant savings for those who qualify, they lack the robust borrower protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts advise that federal loans are a smart first step, but comparing private offers is worthwhile for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

This early access to Nvidia's latest and most powerful processors gives CoreWeave, a smaller cloud provider, a significant competitive advantage over larger rivals like Amazon and Microsoft.

The strategy includes creating up to 300 new centers, a new focus on preventative care with an "obesity moonshot," and better use of technology like the NHS app. Other proposals involve mandatory health warnings on alcohol and new rules for dentists to increase access to care. The plan aims to put the health service "back on its feet," but faces questions about funding and staffing.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is planning to further scale back the "Right to Buy" scheme, which allows social housing tenants to purchase their homes at a discount. Under the new plans, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants will have to live in a property for at least ten years to qualify, up from three. The government stated these changes will help local authorities protect their housing stock and build new homes, though the Conservative opposition has criticized the move as an "attack on aspiration."</p>

The strong report comes amid concerns that President Trump's tariff policies would slow hiring, but for now, the labor market appears to be withstanding the economic uncertainty.
