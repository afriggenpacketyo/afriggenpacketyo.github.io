          <p>Ten candidates vying for California governor in 2026 offered their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure, highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. Democrats Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's actions on redistricting and the economy, respectively, while suggesting quicker action on housing and high-speed rail. Republicans Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton criticized Newsom, with Bianco seeing little positive and Hilton agreeing only on smartphone limits. The candidates collectively emphasized future priorities like healthcare, affordable housing, and fiscal accountability, reflecting diverse visions for California's direction.</p>

This rise followed President Donald Trump's announcement that U.S.-China trade negotiations in Spain were progressing favorably. The positive sentiment was further bolstered by a "framework" deal regarding the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, signaling potential easing of trade tensions. Other Asian markets also saw gains, reflecting investor optimism about global trade relations and economic stability, despite an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting in the U.S.</p>

After facing rejections for apartments and car loans due to her lack of a U.S. credit score, Kim realized the system's inefficiencies for "credit invisible" individuals. Her company, which generated over $20 million last year, empowers immigrants and others by providing pathways to build credit. Kim advocates for early financial literacy and starting with small, manageable loans to establish a positive borrowing history, aiming to transform a challenging system.</p>

These deliveries are expected to substantially enhance Taiwan's deterrence and war-fighting capacity amidst escalating threats from Beijing. While most of the 18 active arms orders are on schedule, some, like the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon, have experienced production delays, pushing delivery to 2026. The F-16V Block 70 fighter program is also running late, though all 66 jets are still slated to arrive before the end of 2026, strengthening the island's defense posture.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Blocks Trump's Attempt to Fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 20:57:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's governing board, just ahead of a critical interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower ruling, finding that firing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which protects the central bank's independence from political pressure. Trump had cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, who denies wrongdoing. This decision prevents Trump from immediately appointing a fourth nominee and gaining a majority on the board, underscoring the legal and political battle over the Fed's autonomy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is considering removing some "black box" warnings from menopause hormone therapy, a move that could alleviate concerns for women like Isabel Kallman experiencing perimenopausal symptoms. Dr. Mary Rosser and Dr. Céline Gounder suggest that earlier research overstated risks by focusing on older women, and more recent studies indicate that treatment timing and delivery methods significantly mitigate risks. While an FDA panel supports removing warnings, dozens of experts call for more scientific assessment and a public hearing before changes. This article highlights evolving medical understanding and the complexities of drug labeling.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that companies transition from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a suggestion the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is actively reviewing. Trump argues this change would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy, contrasting with China's longer-term business view. While current regulations require quarterly reports, the SEC could alter these rules with a majority vote. Supporters of the current system emphasize its transparency and timely information for investors, while critics, including Warren Buffett, have also advocated for less frequent guidance to combat short-termism.

          <p>Researchers from UCLA and the Bay Foundation are releasing a temporary, nontoxic pink dye into Santa Monica Bay to study how ocean circulation impacts the area's poor water quality. The project aims to understand if the 1930s-era breakwater, which affects water flow, contributes to the high levels of fecal bacteria near the Santa Monica Pier, a routinely listed "dirtiest beach." The dye's movement will provide crucial data, with additional releases planned throughout the month. This scientific effort is part of broader initiatives to improve the bay's environmental health.</p>

Recent actions, like Anthropic barring Chinese-owned entities from its AI services, are met with China's growing influence, as seen in Kenya's de-dollarization efforts and Slovakia's rare earth deals. The article notes a potential US "hall pass" on Ukraine and a China-India reset, signaling Beijing's success across Eurasia. This period presents China with an opportunity to reshape the global system, though its own export growth slowdown indicates a continued need for stable international trade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" deal with Chinese officials to avoid a nationwide ban on TikTok, which was mandated by Congress to be sold to a U.S.-based owner by January 2025. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed commercial terms are settled, with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping set to discuss the deal. Concerns over TikTok's Chinese ownership and potential data access or propaganda spread had driven the ban efforts. The politically sensitive issue, given TikTok's 170 million American users, particularly young voters, remains subject to finalization, with a potential for further deadline extensions.</p>
