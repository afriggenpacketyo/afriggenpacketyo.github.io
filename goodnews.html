        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while protesting ICE's actions at a federal courthouse, sparking debate about authoritarianism and the defense of democracy. The article details Lander's arrest and the broader context of protests against ICE tactics in Los Angeles, where citizens have reported being detained based on their appearance. The piece contrasts the Democratic establishment's tepid support for these protests with the urgency of defending inalienable rights, suggesting a need for stronger action against authoritarianism. It emphasizes that defending liberty can be messy, referencing historical examples like the Boston Tea Party, and calls for Democrats to prioritize saving democracy over preserving the status quo.</p>

          <p>David Litt, a former Obama speechwriter, recounts his unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a Joe Rogan fan, in his new book. The article explores how their shared experience of learning to surf together provided neutral ground for connection despite their differing backgrounds and political views. Litt reflects on America's deep political and cultural divisions and how shared activities can foster understanding between individuals with differing views. He argues that Democrats need to connect with working-class people and prioritize entertainment over politics to appeal to a broader range of voters.</p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel *Audition* is reviewed, exploring themes of space as both a dystopian prison and a site of uncharted possibility for human transformation. The story follows three giants hurtling through space, confined in a ship that gets its power from their speech. The article discusses how the giants' language is corrupted and used as a means of exploitation, preventing them from realizing what has been taken from them. The review highlights how the novel uses outer space to imagine alternative forms of human relation, escaping the prejudices and hierarchies of Earth.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Japan in late August to discuss the adoption of a next-generation shinkansen bullet train for a high-speed rail project in western India. The two leaders are also expected to revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership amid China's increasing maritime prowess. The high-speed rail line will connect Ahmedabad and Mumbai, using Japan's shinkansen technology. Modi and Ishiba also aim to strengthen communication ahead of a four-way summit with the United States and Australia under the Quad framework, which New Delhi is set to host in the fall.</p>

After community pressure, the team announced a $1 million commitment to families impacted by the raids. The article argues that the Dodgers, as a team with a history of breaking racial barriers and fostering diversity, have a responsibility to take a leading role in supporting their community.

          <p>The NHS plans to DNA test all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases, as part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness. This initiative will involve sequencing their complete DNA using blood samples from their umbilical cord. The government's 10-year plan for the NHS aims to ease pressure on services and provide faster diagnoses and an early warning signal for disease. While the plan is ambitious, some experts caution that the government would need to hire qualified professionals who could interpret it for patients.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures reaching up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorms warning for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Wales.

An amber heat-health alert is also in effect, warning of pressures on health and social care services. Firefighters are responding to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to be careful.</p>

Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the rigorous process outlined in the bill, which includes multiple assessments and safeguards.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive measures to secure its supply chain offer a valuable lesson as China imposes export restrictions on rare earth elements. After experiencing a targeted export ban in 2010, Japan diversified its sources, invested in non-China rare-earth projects like Australia's Lynas, and implemented stockpiling and recycling initiatives. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has significantly decreased. This approach highlights the importance of a comprehensive government and industry strategy to tackle China's mineral dominance and secure supply chains.</p>
