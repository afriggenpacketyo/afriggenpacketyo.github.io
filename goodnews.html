          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that narrowly missed revenue expectations but beat profit forecasts, leading the company to issue a new full-year earnings outlook. CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in a strong finish to the year, stating that the world is "less uncertain" now than in the first half of 2025. The airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year, a more consolidated forecast than its previous dual-scenario guidance, signaling cautious optimism despite ongoing operational challenges.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with real cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. This potential shift follows public health concerns about corn syrup, notably voiced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a social media post, Trump praised the move as "just better" and beneficial for the company, though Coca-Cola has not yet issued a formal comment confirming the change. The announcement signals a potential major shift in the ingredients of one of America's most iconic products.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking UK study has demonstrated the success of mitochondrial donation, a technique creating "three-parent" babies to prevent devastating genetic disorders. Researchers helped families have eight healthy children by transferring nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While hailed as a major scientific breakthrough for families affected by these often-fatal diseases, the procedure remains controversial. Critics raise concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of germline genetic modification, which is currently prohibited for reproductive use in the United States.</p>

          <p>Doctors in the United Kingdom have confirmed the birth of eight healthy babies using a pioneering technique involving DNA from three individuals. The method, developed in Newcastle, prevents the transmission of incurable mitochondrial diseases from mother to child by using a donor's healthy mitochondria. The children, born through this legally approved process, inherit nearly all their genetic traits from their parents, with a small but crucial contribution from the donor. This marks the first official confirmation of the procedure's success, offering new hope to families.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has offered a positive assessment of China's efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, stating that Beijing is "making big steps." This tone contrasts with his previous justifications for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, which he had explicitly linked to the fentanyl crisis. The comments were made as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries continue, suggesting a potential shift in rhetoric as part of the broader diplomatic and economic discussions. Trump's remarks came as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protection and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Supporters argue this will enable faster, lower-cost payments, while critics point to risks like "depegging" from the underlying asset. The bill is part of a broader push to create formal oversight for the digital currency sector. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump indicated that Republican lawmakers who had previously blocked the bills had changed their stance after a White House meeting. This legislative progress is seen by investors as a crucial step toward providing regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy has supported these efforts, which align with his "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) platform.
