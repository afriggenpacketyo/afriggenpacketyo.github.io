          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, apologized after saying he has never had to buy rice because he receives so much from supporters, stirring criticism amidst rising rice prices. Eto's comments came as his ministry explores ways to lower surging rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The incident highlights the sensitivity of rice prices for Japanese voters, potentially impacting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party ahead of upper house elections in July, especially considering recent polls show low approval for the government's handling of the rice price issue.</p>
