          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced the passage of a $9.4 billion package in the House to codify spending cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. Johnson thanked DOGE for their work that led to this package, emphasizing the importance of responsible and transparent government. He stated that this package is just one of the ways Republicans are codifying DOGE cuts, and he anticipates that it will also pass through the Senate. Johnson views this as a positive step towards prioritizing American taxpayers' interests.</p>

          <p>Bhoomi Chauhan, a 28-year-old student, narrowly avoided being on the Air India flight that crashed in Ahmedabad, India, after missing the flight due to heavy traffic. Chauhan, who was traveling from Ankleshwar, arrived at the airport after boarding had already begun and was denied check-in by airline staff. Frustrated, she left the airport and was later informed of the plane crash, which she described as a miracle. The Air India flight crashed shortly after takeoff, resulting in numerous fatalities, with only one survivor.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles apologized for making personal remarks towards Riley Gaines in an online exchange concerning transgender athletes' participation in sports. Biles initially criticized Gaines for misgendering a transgender softball player, but later expressed regret for the personal nature of her comments. While Biles stood by her belief that sports organizations should create inclusive rules, her apology did little to quell backlash from conservative media. Biles' supporters praised her for defending a transgender minor, while critics accused her of undermining women's spaces.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The proposed reauthorization would allow individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits under the bill. The Senate still needs to navigate the bill through procedural rules.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June rebounded significantly, exceeding expectations, as concerns about the economy and inflation eased amid signs of progress in global trade negotiations. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers reported across-the-board improvements in sentiment, with respondents expressing less pessimism about near-term inflation. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 54. The moves coincided with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS made their U.S. public market debut on Friday, opening at $13.65 a share. The opening trade values the company at roughly $30 billion, outstripping rival Tyson Foods' market cap. JBS's U.S. listing is more than 15 years in the making. The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations led to opposition to its U.S. listing from lawmakers on the both sides of the aisle, making it look unlikely that regulators would grant their approval (not investment advice).</p>
