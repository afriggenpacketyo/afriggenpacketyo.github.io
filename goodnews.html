        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in 'It Ends With Us.' The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and a smear campaign against her, which she detailed in a New York Times article and subsequent legal complaint against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately prove Lively's threats amounted to wrongful extortion and that evidence did not show the New York Times acted with malice in publishing their story. Baldoni has until June 23 to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference, while Lively had previously sought to withdraw claims of emotional distress from her suit.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. The new structure will separate streaming and studios from legacy cable networks and TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that it will be up to the Global Networks team to decide how to monetize TNT Sports programming, including licensing it to other businesses. This could lead to a merger or licensing deal with another media company, such as Comcast's forthcoming Versant spinout, but tax implications will need to be considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a policy U-turn, more than three-quarters of pensioners in England and Wales will receive the winter fuel payment this year if they have an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less.
