          <h2>Revised Data Shows U.S. Economy Grew at a Strong 3.8% Annual Pace in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 11:04:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy's growth for the second quarter was revised upward to a strong 3.8% annualized rate, significantly higher than the previous estimate of 3.3%. This rebound was largely driven by robust consumer spending, which increased at a 2.5% pace, indicating continued consumer confidence despite broader economic headwinds like tariffs. The stronger-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data suggests the economy remains on solid footing, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's decisions on future interest rate cuts. Economists note this resilience may temper the central bank's enthusiasm for additional easing in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice are increasing, as infestations are most common among preschool and elementary-aged students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes that lice spread through direct head-to-head contact and are not an indicator of poor hygiene. Prevention methods include avoiding the sharing of hats, brushes, and clothing, while treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services. Experts also note that students with lice do not need to be immediately sent home from school and can return after starting treatment, aiming to reduce stigma and unnecessary absences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the New England Patriots in a deal that values the NFL franchise at $9 billion. The stake is being sold to two investment groups, Sixth Street Capital and Dean Metropoulos, with the proceeds intended to remain on the team's balance sheet. This valuation reflects the soaring worth of NFL teams, further evidenced by other recent minority stake sales for the New York Giants and Chicago Bears at similarly high valuations. The sale, which does not include the Kraft family's MLS team, the New England Revolution, is pending approval from the NFL's finance committee.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. saw minimal change in August, with a slight 0.2% drop from July, according to the National Association of Realtors. The market was constrained by higher mortgage rates during the period when these deals were signed, though rates have since fallen. A notable trend is the strength at the upper end of the market, where sales of homes over $1 million grew, while sales of homes under $100,000 fell sharply. A slight decrease in housing supply is helping to keep prices stable, with the median price up 2% from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new trend of coffee shop day parties is emerging across the U.S., offering a sober alternative to traditional nightlife. Events like 'Café con Allie' in Los Angeles bring people together in the morning to dance to reggaetón and hip-hop while enjoying specialty coffees instead of alcohol. These gatherings aim to create a safe, inclusive space that supports local businesses and fosters a sense of community. Organizers and attendees say the events provide a positive and energetic start to the day, celebrating Latino culture through music, dance, and the shared experience of a cafecito.</p>

          <h2>James Webb Telescope Captures Unprecedented Images of Milky Way's Largest Star-Forming Region</h2>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has delivered stunning new images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region in our galaxy. Located near the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole, the region is a dense cloud of gas and dust where Webb's infrared instruments have revealed stars and cosmic structures in unprecedented detail. The images are helping astronomers study the lifecycle of stars and understand why star formation is relatively low in the galactic center despite the abundance of material. The vibrant new views showcase the telescope's power to peer through cosmic dust and uncover the universe's hidden processes.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Jobless Claims Drop Unexpectedly, Signaling Continued Labor Market Strength</h2>

          <p>Initial claims for unemployment insurance fell to 218,000 last week, a figure significantly lower than economists' expectations and a sign of persistent strength in the U.S. labor market. This data contrasts with recent concerns from the Federal Reserve about rising risks to employment, which partly motivated its recent interest rate cut. The report, along with other strong economic data like upwardly revised GDP growth and increased durable goods orders, paints a picture of a resilient economy. Despite this strength, markets still anticipate further rate cuts from the Fed later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sports pundit Stephen A. Smith has named Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Maryland Governor Wes Moore as his two favorite potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential election. During his 'Straight Shooter' talk show, Smith praised both governors, calling Moore 'the real deal' for his ability to communicate across the political aisle. While agreeing with a caller that California Governor Gavin Newsom has a presidential look, Smith argued that California's economic issues and high cost of living would likely hinder his chances in a general election. This marks another instance of the broadcaster delving into political commentary.</p>

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated market value of over $600 million. The major operation was conducted by two navy ships following intelligence from anti-drug authorities and British police. This seizure is part of France's long-standing Corymbe naval mission, which aims to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea. The incident highlights the continued use of this maritime route for large-scale drug trafficking, with French authorities having already seized nearly six tons of cocaine in the region earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The traditional 'bases' metaphor for physical intimacy has become a relic for many in Gen Z, replaced by a complex new vocabulary for navigating relationships. Terms like 'sneaky links,' 'situationships,' and 'cushioning' reflect a dating culture that often prioritizes nonchalance and avoids emotional vulnerability. This article explores how Gen Z's approach to sex and romance is shaped by a desire for autonomy and a fear of public judgment, influenced by growing up online. While this creates more individualized paths, it also introduces stress and confusion, as young people navigate a vast 'buffet' of relationship options with little traditional guidance.</p>

          <p>Newly released architectural renderings provide a more detailed view of the large ballroom currently being constructed in the East Wing of the White House. The Trump administration announced the 90,000-square-foot facility, which will have a seated capacity of 650, is being funded by private donors and the president himself. Corporate and individual donors, including Google and Lockheed Martin, have reportedly pledged nearly $200 million for the project. The new ballroom will be significantly larger than the main White House building, and construction on the South Lawn began earlier this month.</p>
