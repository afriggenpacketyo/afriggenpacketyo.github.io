          <p>Design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, with plans to trade on the NYSE under the symbol 'FIG'.

The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a customer base that includes major corporations like Netflix and Stripe. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field emphasized the desire for the company's community to share in its ownership through the public markets.</p>

          <p>According to analysis from CNBC's Jim Cramer, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia distinguished themselves from the other 'Magnificent Seven' technology stocks by ending the first half of 2025 at all-time highs. Microsoft's success was attributed to its Azure cloud business beating growth expectations, demonstrating significant momentum. Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip sector continued to drive its value despite earlier concerns about competition and US government sales restrictions in China. Meta's outperformance was linked to its surprisingly strong quarterly earnings and robust advertising capabilities, showcasing its resilience in the market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since his transfer to Real Madrid, Trent Alexander-Arnold has quickly justified the club's decision to pay a fee to secure him before his Liverpool contract expired. The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, helping his new team advance and earning them an additional ¬£10 million in prize money, more than covering his transfer cost. Under new coach Xabi Alonso, Alexander-Arnold is adapting to a wing-back role in a different tactical system, showing growing confidence with each match. While questions about his defensive work remain, his offensive contributions and high-quality deliveries are already proving to be a valuable asset for the Spanish club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move aimed at accelerating housing construction across the state. The reforms, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will waive CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing developments in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change eliminates a major tool that opponents have historically used to delay or block new housing projects through lengthy environmental reviews and lawsuits. While other hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the legislation marks a major shift in state policy, prioritizing housing abundance over previous development regulations.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic secured his place in the second round after a challenging four-set victory over Alexandre Muller.

Meanwhile, top-ranked Jannik Sinner also advanced with a decisive win, but third-seed Alexander Zverev was unexpectedly defeated in a five-set match.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law banning smoking in most public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. Violators of the new rules could face fines up to 700 euros. This measure aims to address France's high smoking rate, where over 30% of adults smoke and 75,000 people die from tobacco-related illnesses annually. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public spaces like restaurants since 2008, caf√© terraces remain a notable exception, which some smokers view as a final bastion of personal freedom.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. After a shaky start, India recovered to post a strong total of 181-4, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and failing to build momentum despite a solid knock of 54 from Tammy Beaumont. The loss highlights ongoing struggles for England's batters and puts the team's new leadership under pressure as they face a confident and rapidly improving Indian side.</p>
