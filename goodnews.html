          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service for fresh foods, including meat, eggs, and produce, to more than 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to reach at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year. This service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, and Amazon reports it has successfully attracted new grocery customers who now shop more frequently. The announcement led to notable stock declines for competitors such as Instacart, Kroger, Albertsons, and Walmart, underscoring Amazon's aggressive push into the grocery market. This strategic move is part of Amazon's broader initiative to retool its grocery business and more closely integrate Whole Foods Market into its offerings.</p>

          <p>Leading tech companies, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Apple, are actively engaging in unique negotiations with the Trump administration to navigate the impact of new tariffs. Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay a 15% cut of their China revenues for advanced chip sales, while Apple has committed to a substantial $600 billion U.S. investment over four years. Analysts interpret these deals as strategic efforts to secure tariff relief and prevent significant reductions in corporate profits. While some critics question the legality and fairness of these arrangements, they underscore the administration's hands-on approach to trade policy and the tech industry's vulnerability to geopolitical tensions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a new "PreCheck" program designed to streamline and expedite the establishment of new drug manufacturing facilities within the United States. This two-phase initiative directly responds to President Donald Trump's executive order, which called on the FDA to reduce regulatory hurdles and boost domestic drug production. The program aims to significantly cut the time required for new plant approvals, addressing national security concerns stemming from the U.S.'s heavy reliance on foreign drug manufacturing. While concrete details on specific requirements to be eliminated are still sparse, the FDA plans to host a public meeting to present the program and discuss broader challenges related to onshoring pharmaceutical production.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 10:05:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average two-year mortgage rate in the UK has dipped below 5% for the first time since former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, reaching 4.99%. This reduction is described by Moneyfacts as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers, indicating that lenders are now competing more aggressively for business. Despite the Bank of England's base rate holding at 4%, this easing of mortgage rates offers some relief for the hundreds of thousands of borrowers due to remortgage this year. Experts anticipate a continued gradual decline in rates through the autumn, suggesting a modest improvement in housing affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has publicly admitted to an "administrative error" for not possessing a required rod fishing license during a diplomatic engagement with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House in Kent. Lammy has since promptly rectified the oversight by purchasing the necessary license and has informed the Environment Agency of the mistake. Although the foreign secretary did not catch any fish during the outing, the incident highlights the legal requirement for all anglers aged 13 or over in England and Wales to hold a valid fishing license. Fishing illegally can result in a substantial fine of up to £2,500, underscoring the importance of adhering to these regulations.</p>

          <h2>Gianluigi Donnarumma's PSG Career Appears Over Amid Manchester City Transfer Speculation</h2>

          <p>Gianluigi Donnarumma's career at Paris St-Germain appears to be nearing its end after his exclusion from a recent UEFA Super Cup final, following the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille. Manchester City sources describe reports of current talks with Donnarumma as speculation, though they haven't completely ruled out a move should their current number one, Ederson, depart. PSG would seek a transfer fee for the Italy international, who reportedly offered to reduce his salary to remain in Paris, a claim denied by the club. Donnarumma's exclusion is reportedly linked to his ability with the ball at his feet, a crucial requirement for Pep Guardiola's system at Manchester City.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Advised on Key Mistakes to Avoid While Awaiting Potential Mortgage Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 09:54:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve's September meeting approaches, prospective homebuyers are strongly advised by experts to avoid several common pitfalls while anticipating potential mortgage rate cuts. Key warnings include refraining from changing jobs before loan approval, opening new loans or lines of credit, and skipping mortgage preapproval, as these actions can significantly jeopardize loan qualification or limit borrowing capacity. It is crucial for buyers to understand that Federal Reserve rate cuts do not automatically guarantee lower mortgage payments, as rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield and increased buyer demand can offset any savings. Instead, strengthening credit scores, saving for larger down payments, and comparing multiple lenders are recommended strategies for securing favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 09:42:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults now report consuming alcohol, marking the lowest percentage in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend, driven by a growing belief that even moderate drinking is detrimental to health. A record high of 53% of adults now believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, a significant increase from 28% in 2015, with younger adults leading this shift in perception. This trend aligns with evolving scientific consensus on alcohol's health risks, including its established link to cancer. The federal government is expected to release updated dietary guidelines on alcohol, potentially recommending stricter limits, which could further influence public consumption habits.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators have charged 13 individuals in connection with a "cruel and malicious" grandparent scam that defrauded hundreds of elderly Americans out of over $5 million, with the investigation initiated after Uber's global security team flagged suspicious activity. Unknowing Uber drivers were frequently used by the scammers to transport cash from the victims, highlighting an unusual modus operandi. Organized call centers based in the Dominican Republic allegedly orchestrated the elaborate scheme, tricking elderly individuals into believing their grandchildren were in urgent need of money for emergencies. While most victims will likely not recover their lost funds, Uber has since implemented new driver training protocols to help prevent similar incidents, demonstrating a proactive stance against such fraudulent activities.</p>
