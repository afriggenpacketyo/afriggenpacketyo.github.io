          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed an optimized model using satellite data to accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from individual coal-fired power plants. The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, demonstrates the significant potential of remote sensing technology to provide a standardized, high-precision method for global carbon accounting. This framework could help verify emissions data, detect anomalies, and be applied to other industrial sources like steel plants and oil fields.</p>
