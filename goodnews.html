          <p>A group of international culinary experts recently toured Higashikagawa and Miki to delve into the food culture of Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. The chefs participated in local traditions such as visiting a soy sauce brewery and a traditional tea ceremony. They learned to make matcha and enjoyed a performance of classical court music. Chef Luciano Tona noted the common emphasis on simple cooking highlighting local ingredients between Japan and Italy, with many participants finding the matcha experience in a historic setting particularly memorable. The event was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in using light for computation. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz, rivaling advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Optical computing's inherent advantages, such as high speed and low power consumption, position it as a crucial future direction for AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices decreased to $66.57 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50, reaching levels below those before Israel's attack on Iran. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following the initial U.S. strikes on Iran, with President Trump suggesting the Islamic Republic should move toward peace and encouraging Israel to do the same. The oil market sell-off reflects the perception that tensions may be easing.</p>
