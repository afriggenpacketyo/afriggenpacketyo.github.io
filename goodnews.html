          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, following a recent phone call between the two leaders. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a possibility Trump may use as leverage in discussions. This diplomatic push comes after Trump claimed success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, shifting his foreign policy focus to the nearly four-year-long conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin has expressed openness to dialogue but warned that providing Tomahawks to Kyiv would represent a "serious escalation."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Portland City Council has unanimously voted to legally codify its sanctuary city status, implementing new measures to further limit cooperation between local police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The "Protect Portland Initiative" makes the city's sanctuary policies legally binding and prohibits city employees from assisting federal agencies with immigration enforcement. This move establishes a formal framework for resisting federal immigration actions, which Mayor Keith Wilson praised as a stand against federal overreach. The decision comes amid ongoing tensions with the Trump administration over federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential transfer of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine is playing a central role in diplomatic maneuvers between Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that discussions about the long-range missiles prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a meeting with Donald Trump. While Trump has publicly mentioned sending Tomahawks as leverage, he has also expressed concerns about depleting the U.S. stockpile. The strategic value of these missiles lies in their ability to strike high-value Russian targets from a significant distance, though the U.S. currently has a limited number of the necessary ground-based launchers.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Academics Advocate for Context-Specific Research, Arguing Western Frameworks are Inadequate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the World Conference on China Studies in Shanghai, Chinese academics argued that Western theoretical frameworks are often insufficient for accurately understanding China. Scholars, including Renmin University President Lin Shangli, called for research methodologies that are grounded in China's unique historical and social context. They emphasized that concepts developed from Western logic fail to explain key aspects of Chinese civilization and governance, such as its vast social scale. The academics advocated for a tailored approach, supported by extensive field research, to overcome biases and achieve a more profound and accurate interpretation of the country's development.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Achieves Significant Reduction in Drug Overdose Deaths Through Robust Public Health Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Among large U.S. counties, Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, has seen the most significant drop in overdose deaths since the national peak, with a 37% reduction. This success is attributed to a comprehensive strategy involving advanced drug supply surveillance, widespread distribution of naloxone, and providing drug test strips in public spaces like libraries. By using mass spectrometers to identify new and dangerous adulterants like medetomidine and nitazenes, the city's public health department can issue rapid alerts to the public and emergency services. This proactive, data-driven approach empowers users with information and helps tailor an effective response to the volatile drug supply.</p>

          <h2>The Landscape of Arts Criticism Evolves with the Rise of Independent Digital Creators</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The field of professional arts criticism is undergoing a significant transformation as traditional media outlets reduce staff while independent creators on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Substack gain massive followings. This shift is changing the definition of a critic, moving from salaried experts at established publications to self-made commentators who build their own audiences and financial models. While this new ecosystem democratizes commentary and allows for niche analysis, it also introduces challenges, such as the pressure to create viral content, potential conflicts of interest from brand sponsorships, and the loss of editorial oversight that traditional institutions provided.</p>

          <p>Beau Greaves, a 21-year-old darts sensation from Doncaster, has confirmed she will compete in the prestigious PDC World Darts Championship and accept a professional two-year tour card. This decision marks a significant step in her career, as she had previously declined to play in the main world championship at Alexandra Palace. Greaves, a three-time WDF women's world champion, recently secured her spot by finishing as the runner-up on the development tour, becoming only the second woman ever to earn a full-time professional tour card through this route.

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart has signed a new contract with the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights, becoming the first of five acquitted players from Canada's 2018 world junior team to rejoin the league. Hart and four teammates were found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman in a highly publicized trial in Canada. Following the verdict, the NHL ruled the players were ineligible to sign with teams until October 15 as part of a reinstatement process. At a press conference, Hart expressed excitement to move forward and return to playing hockey after being out of the game for a year and a half.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Donald Trump in Washington to advocate for advanced U.S. weaponry, including Tomahawk cruise missiles. The high-stakes meeting comes just after Trump announced he had agreed to hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy suggested that the mere discussion of providing Tomahawks to Kyiv has already motivated Moscow to re-engage in dialogue. Trump, however, has expressed reluctance to deplete the U.S. missile stockpile, creating uncertainty ahead of the crucial talks with the Ukrainian leader.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that participants in the upcoming nationwide "No Kings" protests must maintain strict nonviolence to counteract the narrative being pushed by Donald Trump's allies. Prominent Republicans have labeled the demonstrations a "Hate America rally" organized by violent extremists, a smear campaign intended to delegitimize dissent. The author contends that any instance of violence, regardless of who initiates it, would play directly into the administration's hands and could be used as a pretext for a more severe crackdown on civil liberties. By remaining peaceful, the millions of protesters can effectively demonstrate who the true proponents of democratic values are.</p>

          <p>Millions of people are expected to participate in a second wave of "No Kings" protests across more than 2,500 U.S. cities and towns this Saturday. Organized by a coalition of over 200 groups, the demonstrations aim to challenge what they describe as the Trump administration's authoritarian excesses, corruption, and crackdowns on dissent. Organizers anticipate a larger turnout than the previous protest in June, despite the administration's increased use of federal forces in cities like Portland and Chicago. The protests intend to send a clear message that the American public rejects authoritarian-style governance and will not be intimidated into silence.</p>

          <h2>California Avoids Summer Power Alerts for Second Consecutive Year, Crediting Battery Storage Growth</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has successfully navigated another summer without issuing a single "Flex Alert," a call for voluntary energy conservation that was once a common occurrence during heat waves. Experts and state officials attribute this increased grid stability to a massive expansion of battery energy storage capacity, which has grown over 3,000% since 2020. These batteries store excess solar power generated during the day and discharge it onto the grid during peak evening demand, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered "peaker" plants. This technological shift has been a game-changer for grid reliability and is crucial to California's goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2045.</p>
