          <p>The New York Times' The Opinions weekly series, featuring columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens, is coming to an end after eight years. In their final conversation, they reflect on the series, its impact, and the changing political landscape. They discuss the degradation of public discourse, the rise of social media, and the importance of humor and civility in political conversations. They also address reader questions about changing positions and informing a world that doesn't want to be informed.</p>
