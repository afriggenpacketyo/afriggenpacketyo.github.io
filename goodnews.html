          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until they are old enough to drive independently. To prepare them, she recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, focusing on privacy, moderation, and the value of real-world engagement. Twenge emphasizes setting firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls, to help children develop a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards the first two, including bonds and gold, arguing they rely on government stability or speculation about future buyers. Instead, Buffett champions investing in productive assets like farms and businesses, which generate tangible value over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is measured by their output, not by daily market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis suggests that in an era of authoritarianism, sincere belief in democratic principles, however uncool it may seem, is essential for countering the nihilism that allows such regimes to thrive.</p>
