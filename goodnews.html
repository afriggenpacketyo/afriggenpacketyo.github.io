          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates, whom she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. The project not only helped Schafer feel seen again but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own missed opportunities for connection during their school years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a permanent injunction against a Trump administration executive order that targeted the law firm Susman Godfrey, marking the fourth such judicial rebuke. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order unconstitutional, aligning with previous decisions that found similar orders against other major law firms to be violations of First and Fifth Amendment rights. These executive orders sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. This latest decision reinforces a series of legal victories for firms challenging what judges have described as an unprecedented attack on the legal system.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and well-received performance that focused on their biggest hits. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage antics, offered a more subdued but musically tight show, acknowledging his nervousness to the large crowd. While the set was praised for its professionalism and crowd-pleasing song selection, some critics noted it felt safe and lacked the band's usual chaotic energy. The performance was a highlight of a day that also featured surprise sets from artists like Lorde and an emotional comeback by Lewis Capaldi.</p>

          <p>Authorities have successfully captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. Antoine Massey, 33, was located and arrested at a residence in the city and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, has been called the worst in recent state history by Louisiana's governor. The escape has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large as the extensive manhunt continues.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to watch for the upcoming labor report and earnings from beverage company Constellation Brands in the week ahead. He noted the market finished the recent quarter on a strong note, recovering from turbulence caused by President Trump's tariff announcements. Cramer expressed skepticism about Constellation Brands' performance, suggesting the alcohol sector is facing headwinds from the popularity of weight-loss drugs and cannabis. He also highlighted that the company has cited the administration's immigration policies as a factor negatively impacting sales among its significant Hispanic consumer base.

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a powerful bowling performance from Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets. Hazlewood was the chief architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, spinner Nathan Lyon took the final wickets to seal the win for Australia with two full days of play to spare.</p>

          <p>A man from Riverside County, California, has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud related to the sale of memorabilia signed by the late comic book icon Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, 59, admitted to earning over $1.2 million between 2015 and 2018 by selling items autographed by Lee, with whom he had a personal relationship. Anderson failed to report this income to the IRS, evading approximately $482,833 in taxes. As part of his sentence, he has been ordered to pay the full amount back in restitution.</p>
