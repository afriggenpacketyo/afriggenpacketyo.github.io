        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a ban that has strained diplomatic relations for two years. The ban was initially imposed over concerns about the release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. This easing of restrictions, which still excludes 10 prefectures including Fukushima, is seen as a move by Beijing to reset ties with Tokyo amid growing trade uncertainty with the United States. The resumption is contingent on continued international monitoring and Chinese sampling to ensure the safety and quality of the aquatic products.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax just one day before the first payments were due, following a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to terminate all trade negotiations. The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to the revenue of large tech companies like Google and Amazon, a move the U.S. called discriminatory. Ottawa stated the reversal was made "in anticipation" of a new comprehensive trade arrangement, allowing for the resumption of vital economic and security talks. This decision marks an about-face for Canadian officials, who had previously insisted they would proceed with the tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Car Shipments to US Resume as Reduced Tariffs from New Trade Deal Take Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 00:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British car manufacturers are resuming large-scale shipments to the United States as a new trade deal reduces a punitive 25% tariff down to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. The higher tariff, imposed by the Trump administration, had caused exports of brands like Mini and Aston Martin to plummet. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, some British farmers argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip, citing concessions on US ethanol and beef imports. Meanwhile, the UK steel industry is still anxiously awaiting promised zero-tariff access to the US market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As he approaches his 90th birthday, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, remains a global symbol of non-violent advocacy for Tibetan autonomy and religious freedom. Living in exile in India since a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule, he has spent over six decades promoting his "Middle Way" approach, earning a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. Despite China viewing him as a dangerous separatist, he has met with numerous world leaders and inspired millions. His upcoming birthday is significant, as he has indicated he may soon provide more details about his succession, a process China seeks to control.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Cause More Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. A key factor is the regenerative braking system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy when slowing down. This process can result in low-frequency deceleration that is known to provoke the uncomfortable symptoms of motion sickness in passengers.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team has suffered a setback as Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams has been ruled out of the tour of Australia due to a hamstring injury. Williams sustained the injury after scoring a try in the team's win over Western Force on Saturday. In his place, Scotland's Ben White has been called up to join the squad. The tour manager expressed his disappointment for Williams, who he described as an "exemplary Lion." Williams's departure leaves flanker Jac Morgan as the only remaining Welsh player in the 38-man squad.</p>

          <p>Pride Month concluded with marches around the world that combined vibrant celebration with pointed protest against rising political attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. In New York City, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," with demonstrators targeting recent Trump administration policies that target transgender people and dismantle diversity programs. In Budapest, Hungary, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events to hold their march. These events underscored a global dynamic where the joy of Pride is increasingly intertwined with resistance against legislative and rhetorical crackdowns on the community.</p>
