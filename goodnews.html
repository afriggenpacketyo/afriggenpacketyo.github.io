          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon in a seventh-round stoppage. The victory marks Wilder's first win since 2022, following a series of high-profile losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight was a more modest affair than his previous stadium-filling events, reflecting a stripped-back approach as he works to rebuild his confidence and skills. Post-fight, the 39-year-old stated this is a "new beginning" and that he is focused on becoming a more well-rounded fighter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, argues that China holds a "comparative advantage" in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay. He posits that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operate under a well-established regulatory framework. This perspective suggests China's existing digital payment infrastructure provides a strong foundation for developing and regulating its own digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a link between a Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and cooked vegetables. A modified version including fruit and dairy also showed benefits. This is the first study of its kind to specifically investigate the mental health benefits of this traditional dietary pattern, suggesting a potential role for nutrition in combating depression.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has announced the completion of the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, successfully helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein. This development represents a significant potential advancement in BCI technology, promising reduced surgical risk and faster recovery times for patients.</p>
