        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade determined that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured their first trophy under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, largely thanks to the performance of Cole Palmer. Palmer, a ¬£37.5m signing from Manchester City, played a pivotal role in Chelsea's Conference League final win against Real Betis, contributing significantly to their 4-1 victory. After a lackluster first half, Palmer's influence grew, setting up goals for Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson, with additional goals from Jadon Sancho and Moises Caicedo. His performance was widely praised, with commentators highlighting his maturity and leadership on the field.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed his displeasure with U.S. chip controls that have effectively closed off the $50 billion Chinese market to U.S. industry. Huang stated that the company is taking a multibillion-dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed due to these restrictions. The Trump administration informed Nvidia that its previously approved H20 processor for China would require an export license, cutting off sales with no grace period. Despite this, Nvidia reported strong revenue growth, driven by demand for its AI chips, but Huang made it clear that the China situation is a significant concern.</p>

          <p>The government is easing planning restrictions to make it easier for millions of homes to install heat pumps, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. A key restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property has been lifted. Consumer groups, however, caution that the changes will not benefit those in rented or leasehold properties, and the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier. The changes are part of the government's Warm Homes Plan, which seeks to lower household bills and cut planet-warming emissions.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over ¬£1 billion to develop battlefield technology and establish a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. This investment aims to enhance decision-making speed on the battlefield by better connecting soldiers with key information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. The new Cyber Command will oversee military cyber operations, including electronic warfare and intercepting adversaries' communications. The funding is made possible by the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, reflecting the changing nature of warfare.</p>

Kennedy urged Canadian authorities to conduct further testing to better understand the virus, while Oz offered to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida. However, most veterinarians agree that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk.</p>
