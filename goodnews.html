          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers showcased a resurgent offense in their win against the Boston Red Sox, suggesting a turnaround after a difficult start to July. After averaging just three runs per game earlier in the month, the team has now scored at least five runs in seven of its last ten contests. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak. The performance provides a positive sign for the team as the trade deadline approaches, potentially influencing their decisions on acquiring more offensive players.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent from the United States, taking advantage of university funding cuts and stricter visa policies.

This influx of brainpower is fueling the expansion and use of artificial intelligence within China's rapidly growing quant sector.

          <h2>Inter Miami Owner Criticizes MLS Suspension of Lionel Messi as 'Draconian'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:14:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has strongly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players, who were voted into the All-Star game, did not participate. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why missing an exhibition match would lead to a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber defended the decision, citing a long-standing policy, but acknowledged that the league would reevaluate the rule going forward.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when L'Oréal opposed Rebecca Dowdeswell's attempt to re-register the trademark for her business, "nkd," claiming it would cause confusion with its "Naked" makeup line. Dowdeswell, who has already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no consumer confusion in 15 years of trading. She remains determined to fight, stating she is in a stronger position and will not be intimidated by the corporation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions have been ideal for these species, with a notable boom in aphids providing a plentiful food source for ladybirds. While a welcome sight, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This year's abundance contrasts sharply with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The suit had alleged that the city's policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally thwart federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, affirming that the city's welcoming ordinance is lawful and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society is examining the impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which arose from the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations in the 1940s and 1950s. The exhibit focuses on the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer questions about their political affiliations. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor ruined numerous careers and raises enduring questions about freedom of speech, privacy, and the consequences of holding unpopular political views in a democracy.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The conservation effort involves capturing healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifting them to an isolated, protected mountain range. The mission is already showing signs of success, as biologists recently observed a group of nine sheep that included several newborn lambs. The project represents a monumental effort to ensure the survival of this iconic native species.</p>

          <p>This article examines the scientific basis for popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, sleeping seven to nine hours, and exercising 150 minutes weekly. Experts suggest that while these are good guidelines, there can be flexibility. For instance, thirst is generally a reliable indicator for hydration, but consistent water intake can help with other health issues. However, getting adequate sleep is considered less negotiable due to its profound impact on long-term health, including reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and depression. The consensus is to incorporate a balanced, non-rigid approach to these healthy habits.</p>

With a degree in political science, Pulido says he has always had a desire for public service and plans to focus on issues like immigration reform and the local economy. He aims to connect with voters through a series of "ranch halls."</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, with researchers focusing on the unique physiological factors affecting female athletes. This new wave of research investigates how breast biomechanics can alter running stride, how the menstrual cycle impacts performance and anxiety, and why women face a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This shift marks a significant departure from the past, when data and training methods were often based on male athletes. The growing body of knowledge is helping to improve performance, prevent injuries, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

          <p>Once dismissed as superficial, reality television is being re-examined by some social experts for its potential positive impact on society. The article suggests that by showcasing diverse demographics and raw, unfiltered emotions, the genre can serve as a tool for greater social understanding. It can destigmatize health conditions, introduce audiences to different life experiences, and spark national conversations about complex issues like coercive control. While ethical concerns about participant welfare persist, some research links shows like MTV's "16 and Pregnant" to positive changes in social outcomes like reduced teen birth rates.</p>
