          <p>KindlyMD's shares experienced a significant increase of 250% following its merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment company led by David Bailey, a cryptocurrency advisor to President Donald Trump. The newly formed entity secured $200 million in convertible debt and $510 million in fresh capital through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, with shares offered at $1.12 each. Bailey mentioned that the convertible note carries a premium to the PIPE price, with investors buying shares at $1.12, but the notes will convert at $2.80 and that the notes are zero-coupon for the first two years. The investment attracted support from over 200 investors, including notable figures in the cryptocurrency space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses optimal scenarios for using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in 2025, emphasizing that home equity can be a viable financing source, particularly with HELOC interest rates currently under 8%. The article suggests using a HELOC for financing home renovation projects, as interest paid on such projects is tax-deductible, making it a cost-effective option. Additionally, it highlights that a HELOC can be beneficial when price changes are affordable, given its variable interest rate, and when seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinancing, or personal loans. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and needs.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living U.S. citizen held hostage in Gaza, was released by Hamas on Monday as President Trump departed for a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Alexander, who grew up in New Jersey before serving in the Israeli military, was abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack on October 7, 2023. Hamas stated the release was unconditional, hoping to work toward a lasting ceasefire and renew humanitarian aid to Gaza, while Netanyahu's office emphasized that Israel made no commitment to a ceasefire or release of terrorists. The release has sparked hope for further negotiations to end the conflict and bring the remaining hostages home.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explores the evolving understanding of the "closet" within queer culture, prompted by Paul Reubens' revelation about concealing his sexuality for professional reasons. The article reflects on how the concept of being "in the closet" has transformed from a binary state to a more complex spectrum, especially with increased visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities. It also discusses the resurgence of interest in closeted characters in media, potentially driven by nostalgia for a time when gay identity was more central to queer culture, and the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. The article ultimately argues that the decision to remain silent about one's identity can have significant and lasting consequences, both personally and culturally.</p>
