          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position while her lawsuit proceeds. The judge ruled that the president's stated cause for removal, which relates to allegations of misconduct on mortgage applications before her tenure, is not legally permissible for firing a Fed governor. This ruling underscores the critical issue of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, a principle Cook's lawyers argue is essential for financial stability. The decision also found that Cook's due process rights were violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Wednesday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising as investors anticipated key U.S. inflation data. Positive corporate earnings reports fueled the upward trend, notably from Zara's parent company Inditex, which jumped over 6% after announcing a significant acceleration in sales for its new collections. Shares for the pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk also rose following its announcement of major job cuts as part of a restructuring plan. Market sentiment was also influenced by reports of President Trump urging the EU to impose tariffs on China and India over their Russian oil purchases, adding a layer of geopolitical consideration for investors.

          <p>Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli is currently facing criticism for a decline in his performance, prompting questions about his role in the team. The Brazilian player's recent struggles were highlighted in a key moment during the loss to Liverpool, where a poor decision on a counter-attack exemplified his apparent lack of confidence. Analysts suggest that manager Mikel Arteta's shift in tactical style, from an open attacking system to a more controlled build-up, may not suit Martinelli's strengths, which thrive in open space. While the club still trusts him, his form is under discussion, especially with new attacking options available and a more direct playing style being implemented this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant drop in mortgage interest rates has spurred the largest wave of borrower demand in three years, with total mortgage application volume jumping 9.2% last week. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.49%, its lowest level since October 2024, encouraging both prospective homebuyers and existing homeowners to act. Applications for home purchases rose by 7%, while refinancing applications surged by 12% compared to the previous week. This increase in activity suggests that lower borrowing costs are finally enticing buyers who had been waiting on the sidelines for more favorable market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alcohol brands Strongbow and Jägermeister have withdrawn social media advertisements following a ruling by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The watchdog determined that two Jägermeister ads irresponsibly implied alcohol was a key component of social success. A separate ruling found that a Strongbow ad, which featured a talking can of cider goading a man to skip writing his wedding vows for a barbecue, suggested that alcohol was indispensable and should take priority in life. Both companies accepted the judgments and removed the content, which the ASA deemed to be in breach of broadcasting codes.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Snowflake and Alphabet are two promising technology stocks for long-term investment heading into 2025. Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform, is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, demonstrated by its 32% year-over-year revenue growth and strong customer retention. Meanwhile, Alphabet continues to see robust performance from its core Google Search business, which grew 10% despite competition from AI models. The article also notes that Alphabet's stock is bolstered by a recent legal victory in a major antitrust case, removing significant uncertainty for investors and positioning the company for continued growth.

He cited Chinese-funded projects, including roads, an airport, and an expressway, as key contributors to Cambodia's growth.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States' status as a global leader in innovation is under threat due to cuts in research funding, diminished support for education, and attacks on free inquiry. The authors contend that the system of public-private partnerships and federal investment in basic science, which historically fueled transformative companies, is being dismantled. To remain competitive against rivals like China, they call for decisive, bipartisan action to restore and expand research funding, revamp small business support, and shield universities from political interference. The article warns that without these measures, the U.S. risks losing the competitive edge that has long driven its economic dynamism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first onshore wave energy project in the United States has been launched at the Port of Los Angeles, marking a milestone for renewable energy technology. Developed by the Swedish company Eco Wave Power, the pilot project uses a series of floaters attached to a wharf to capture the ocean's kinetic energy and convert it into electricity. This onshore approach is designed to be more cost-effective and less environmentally disruptive than offshore systems. While the initial pilot will power about 100 homes, the long-term goal is to scale up the technology along the port's breakwater, potentially generating enough clean energy for 60,000 homes.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Getty Villa, "The Kingdom of Pylos," showcases artifacts from a Late Bronze Age Greek palace, but its most significant piece is also its smallest. The "Pylos Combat Agate," a 3,500-year-old seal stone just over an inch long, features an exquisitely detailed battle scene that is challenging long-held timelines of Greek art. The carving's sophistication suggests the use of a magnifying lens, pushing back the known use of such tools by centuries. This tiny masterpiece, found in the tomb of a wealthy aristocrat known as the Griffin Warrior, offers a stunning glimpse into the artistic and cultural richness of this ancient kingdom.</p>
