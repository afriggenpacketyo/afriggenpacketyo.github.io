          <h2>US Lawmakers Propose Renaming Social Security Claiming Ages for Clarity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 08:38:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill aims to change the terminology for Social Security claiming ages to better inform retirees of the financial implications of their decisions. The proposal would rename "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and "full retirement age" to "standard benefit age" to more accurately reflect the financial trade-offs. This legislative effort seeks to improve financial literacy as many Americans are unaware of the age at which they qualify for full benefits. The proposed changes come amid broader debates about the program's long-term solvency and potential reforms, though officials state that raising the retirement age is not currently being considered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, signals a potential shift towards federal involvement in America's housing crisis, which is often exacerbated by restrictive local zoning laws. The legislation proposes creating model zoning codes and offering financial incentives to municipalities that increase their housing supply, an approach championed by some think tanks as "Right-to-Build Zones." While the federal government has historically preempted local rules for major infrastructure, this act represents a more collaborative strategy to encourage denser housing construction. The goal is to untangle complex regulations and overcome local opposition to much-needed development projects.</p>

          <p>A London court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a significant procedural error. Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara, was charged with displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because it was filed after the six-month statutory time limit had expired, meaning the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence pro-Palestinian voices, a sentiment echoed by his supporters.</p>

          <p>Costco announced stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results, with both revenue and earnings per share surpassing analyst estimates. The retail giant's success was fueled by an 8% increase in total revenue and robust growth in membership fee income, which accelerated to 14%. While comparable sales remained steady, the company saw a slight dip in membership renewal rates, partly due to an increase in online sign-ups which tend to have lower renewal rates. Despite minor challenges, the company's performance was solid, with improved gross margins attributed to supply chain efficiencies and increased sales of its private-label Kirkland Signature products.

          <h2>Paccar Stock Surges Following Announcement of New Tariffs on Imported Heavy Trucks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 08:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy-duty trucks. The president stated the measure was intended to protect American manufacturers from an "onslaught of outside interruptions." As Paccar produces over 90% of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, the tariff is expected to level the playing field against competitors who manufacture in countries like Mexico at a lower cost. Bank of America analysts noted that the new policy directly addresses this cost disparity, placing Paccar in a more advantageous competitive position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan has temporarily suspended planned export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa, a move intended to de-escalate a diplomatic dispute. The curbs, which would have required special approval for shipping 47 different chip-related products, were announced after Pretoria demanded that Taipei's representative office be relocated. Following the announcement of the controls, the South African government reportedly agreed to enter discussions regarding the office dispute. This led Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs to pause the implementation of the measures, signaling a potential path for diplomatic resolution between the two governments.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the challenges and triumphs of a marriage between a liberal New York Yankees fan and her conservative, Donald Trump-supporting, Los Angeles Dodgers-loving husband. The author recounts navigating deep political disagreements, often by following a therapist's advice to avoid political discussions altogether to preserve their relationship. Despite their opposing views, she reflects on the deep bond they share, built on laughter, mutual support, and shared family experiences. The essay illustrates that love can endure across profound ideological divides, finding common ground in acts of kindness and the universal equalizer of humor, even when their favorite baseball teams face off.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Understanding Financial Advisor Compensation Models</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hiring a financial advisor requires understanding how they are compensated, yet many investors are unclear about the various fee structures. Advisors are typically paid through either commissions for selling specific products or different fee-based models, such as a percentage of assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or hourly rates. Commission-based models can create potential conflicts of interest, while AUM fees are common but may not be accessible for those with fewer assets to invest. Understanding these differences is crucial for investors to protect their returns and ensure the advice they receive aligns with their best interests, as each model has distinct pros and cons.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Family Offices Favor Public Stocks Over Venture Capital for AI Investments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite high-profile venture capital deals, a Goldman Sachs survey reveals that most family offices—the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy—prefer to invest in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs. The poll of 245 family offices found that 52% gain AI exposure through the stock market, compared to only 25% who invest directly in AI startups. This preference is partly attributed to more confidence in the valuations of public companies, as many private market valuations are seen as inflated. The trend indicates a more cautious, risk-averse strategy among the world's wealthiest families as they seek to capitalize on the growth of AI.</p>

          <p>The EuroLeague stands as the premier professional basketball competition outside of North America's NBA, known for its tactical, team-oriented, and intensely competitive style of play. Established in 2000 by a group of top European clubs seeking more control, the league operates with a mix of permanent member clubs and invited teams, including a new wildcard entry from Dubai. Many players and coaches consider every EuroLeague game crucial, in contrast to the longer NBA season, and the different FIBA rules create a more compact and strategic on-court product. The league serves as both a destination for former NBA players and a high-level training ground for European talent.</p>
