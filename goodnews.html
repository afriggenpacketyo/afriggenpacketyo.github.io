        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that logistical challenges, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are a primary cause for declining childhood vaccination rates. Parents face difficulties such as booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders, which has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. The report recommends improving access through NHS apps, expanding services, and better utilizing health visitors to address the concerning trend and close vaccination inequality gaps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% due to a new price cap from the regulator Ofgem. While this provides immediate relief, concerns persist about affordability during the upcoming winter, as prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Analysts predict only a minor further drop in October, and global uncertainty could still impact wholesale prices, prompting Ofgem to encourage consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for more stability.

An executive stated that while the move aligns with the company's long-term strategy of producing goods closer to consumers, the current tariff environment under President Trump accelerated the decision. The company expects the new facility to be fully operational by early 2027, at which point its corresponding factory in China will close.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list" after he paid over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment. The debt stemmed from his former company's failure to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a TV project that fell through in 2019. This resolution now allows WGA members to work with Emmett, clearing a significant hurdle for his current production company as it seeks to develop new film projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in US inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs, and using logistical loopholes to delay payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect may be temporary and that consumers could still see prices rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies are exhausted.
