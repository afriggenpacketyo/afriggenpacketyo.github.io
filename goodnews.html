          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and advocate for his "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next Surgeon General. This decision follows the withdrawal of the previous nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, due to concerns about her alignment with Trump's agenda. Dr. Means, known for her focus on metabolic health and skepticism towards the American medical system, is expected to collaborate closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nomination has sparked debate, with some praising her qualifications and others expressing concerns about her views on vaccines.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere around May 10 after remaining in orbit for over half a century. Experts believe the lander probe, designed to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, may partially survive re-entry, although the risk to people on the ground is considered low. The capsule's potential landing zone spans a wide area between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude, covering much of the inhabited world. While the exact landing location is uncertain, the likelihood of causing significant damage is minimal.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Expected to Cut Interest Rates Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 19:01:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to cut interest rates on Thursday, potentially lowering them to 4.25% from 4.5%, with further reductions expected later in the year. This move aims to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, although it may result in lower returns for savers. The decision is influenced by UK inflation rates and broader global economic uncertainty, including the potential impact of President Trump's tariff policies. Analysts suggest the inconsistency of Trump's policies could push down growth and inflation, prompting further rate cuts.</p>

          <p>An AI-generated version of Chris Pelkey, an Arizona man who was killed in a road rage incident, delivered a victim's statement at his killer's sentencing. Pelkey's family used AI technology to recreate his voice and image, allowing him to express forgiveness towards his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas. While the judge praised the use of AI, some experts have raised ethical concerns about the precedent this case sets for using AI in legal proceedings. The judge sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.</p>
