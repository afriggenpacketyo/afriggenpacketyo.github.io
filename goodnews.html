          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that millions of adults seek chiropractic treatment, prompting experts to discuss the potential benefits and risks associated with this form of care. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors undergo extensive medical training and base decisions on scientific research. Potential benefits of chiropractic care include reduced tension, inflammation, and stress, while experts caution against seeking chiropractic treatment for more serious underlying issues, as it could lead to complications or spinal cord injury. Experts advise individuals to seek transparent chiropractors with clear treatment plans and to consider a multidisciplinary approach to spine care. </p>

          <p>Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, known as the philosopher-king, has experienced a resurgence in popularity on social media due to his Stoic principles and reflections on good governance. Museums in Trier, Germany, are co-hosting an exhibition exploring his life and philosophy, emphasizing the relevance of his teachings in today's crisis-ridden and polarized world. Aurelius's "Meditations," written for personal reflection, offer insights into maintaining equanimity, acting for the common good, and leading a virtuous life.

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, currently the United States men's national team coach, has dismissed rumors linking him to the vacant Tottenham Hotspur managerial position. He stated that returning to Tottenham is "not realistic" given his commitment to the USMNT, where he was appointed in October 2024. This comes after Tottenham sacked Ange Postecoglou despite leading the club to its first trophy in 17 years, fueling speculation about Pochettino's potential return, where he had a successful five-year stint previously. Pochettino emphasized his focus on his current role and the USMNT's performance, particularly after a recent friendly loss to Turkey.</p>

          <p>The Youth Sport Trust (YST) has reported a "troubling decline" in the number of hours secondary school pupils in England spend on physical education (PE). The organization's figures show nearly 4,000 PE hours lost in the last year alone in state-funded schools, and almost 45,000 PE hours have disappeared from secondary school timetables since the London 2012 Olympics. The number of PE teachers in England has also dropped by 7%, prompting the YST to call for urgent action to protect and prioritize PE. The government has responded by stating its determination to break down barriers to accessing PE and school sports for young people.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector ahead of the upcoming Spending Review, which will fund research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to decide how the funds are spent, with the goal of creating jobs and boosting security. While the Institute of Physics welcomed the funding, they emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers, and Wellcome warned that visa costs for scientists and financial challenges at universities could hinder the government's ambitions. The chancellor has warned that the Spending Review will reflect a squeeze on government funding.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, discusses how having a baby changed her perspective on full-time work, leading her to seek a flexible working arrangement. Cole believes that offering more flexible working options for teachers, especially new parents, is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the profession.
