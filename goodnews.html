          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 03:42:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% next April, in line with the latest average earnings growth data, as part of the government's "triple lock" commitment. This increase would add over £500 annually to the new state pension, bringing it closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. Experts and pensioners express concern that this will result in more retirees being subject to income tax, effectively clawing back some of the gains from the pension increase.

This marks the second consecutive game where Mayfield has led a last-minute, game-winning drive to start the season, placing the Buccaneers at a 2-0 record. The victory was a reversal of fortune from the teams' 2023 meeting, where the Texans scored in the final seconds to win.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, widely known as the "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, long championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, will create a "duty of candour" and could lead to criminal sanctions for officials who fail to cooperate or are dishonest. The law aims to prevent cover-ups and is expected to apply to future tragedies, drawing lessons from other scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon case.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 20-9, largely due to a masterful defensive showing that included three interceptions and 15 batted passes. Linebacker Daiyan Henley, despite battling an illness, set the tone by intercepting a pass on the first play from scrimmage and finished with ten tackles. The Chargers' defense held the Raiders to just 218 total yards, securing a key divisional win and improving their record to 2-0 for the season.</p>

          <p>Scotland's legal system is poised for a major overhaul as the Scottish Parliament debates a bill to eliminate the controversial "not proven" verdict. This verdict, unique to Scots law, results in an acquittal but is criticized for causing confusion and failing to provide closure for victims. To balance the reform, the bill also proposes raising the requirement for a guilty verdict to a two-thirds jury majority, up from the current simple majority. The legislation is expected to pass, marking a significant change in the country's criminal justice procedures.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated efforts to build a unified national market, identifying it as crucial for China to gain a competitive advantage internationally and achieve its development goals. In an article for the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and destructive price competition among domestic firms. The directive suggests a push for companies to compete on product quality rather than engaging in price wars, aiming to phase out obsolete industrial capacity.</p>

Participants, who typically spent hours on phones and gaming consoles in their rooms, reported feeling better rested and more engaged in other activities like baking and reading. While the teens still used their devices in common areas, the project highlighted the benefits of setting physical boundaries with technology, leading some to adopt new habits like keeping phones out of their bedrooms at night.</p>

However, using Ohtani as a reliever presents logistical challenges and is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose his designated hitter spot.</p>
