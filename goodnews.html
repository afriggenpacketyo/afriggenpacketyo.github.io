          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was halted due to a malfunction in the electronic line-calling system. The technology failed to make an audio call on a ball that was visibly out, leading the chair umpire to stop play. After confirming the system was unable to track the point, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed. The incident prompted frustration from Pavlyuchenkova, who claimed a game was "stolen" from her as a result of the technological error.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. The article explores Twain's complex personality, tracing his sardonic humor to a life marked by financial anxiety and personal pain, despite his immense success. Chernow's biography delves into how Twain's experiences shaped his iconic works like "Huckleberry Finn" and his sharp commentary on American politics, race, and culture. The piece highlights Twain's lasting legacy as a quintessential American voice whose observations remain remarkably relevant today.</p>

          <h2>Cast and Crew Reflect on the Making of "Jaws" for its 50th Anniversary</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" look back on the notoriously difficult production that created a cinematic classic. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recall the problem-plagued shoot on Martha's Vineyard, where the mechanical shark rarely worked, the budget ballooned, and tensions ran high among the actors. Despite initial fears that the film would be a failure, director Steven Spielberg's innovative approach turned misfortune into a blockbuster that defined the summer movie genre. The article highlights how the film's simple, human story of three men against a shark continues to terrify and captivate audiences.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Located in the northern Barranca province, the city is believed to have been a crucial trading center connecting ancient coastal communities with those in the Andes and Amazon. Researchers suggest the find provides vital insight into the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, which was established around 5,000 years ago. The site contains 18 structures, including temples and residential buildings, along with various ceremonial artifacts, highlighting a sophisticated and strategically important society.</p>

          <h2>The Evolving Symbolism of the Statue of Liberty from Abolition to Immigration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 09:19:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived not as a symbol of immigration, but as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States. This article traces its transformation into a beacon for immigrants, a shift largely inspired by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus." The opening of Ellis Island and the subsequent waves of immigration imbued the statue with new meaning, which was later cemented by President John F. Kennedy's "A Nation of Immigrants." The piece also touches on the history of U.S. immigration law, including the restrictive ethnic quotas of 1924 and their repeal in 1965, which reshaped the country's demographics.</p>

          <p>Despite rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome Chinese investment. According to the leader of a Chinese chamber of commerce, city leaders are keen on these investments to stimulate local economies, particularly for manufacturing projects that are otherwise difficult to source. While national-level political rhetoric has created concern among potential investors, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive. The article notes that President Trump's tariffs have also increased the incentive for Chinese companies to establish production facilities within the U.S. for domestic sales.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five common, overused phrases that can unintentionally make a person sound judgmental, potentially damaging relationships and trust. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, even if the speaker's intent is to be helpful or correct. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" or using "yes, and..." to build on ideas. By being more mindful of both intention and impact, individuals can foster more positive and respectful communication with colleagues, friends, and family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is significantly expanding its political and economic influence in the Western Balkans, using methods described as "infrastructure imperialism." The recently inaugurated Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, exemplifies this soft power projection. Beyond religious buildings, Turkish investors are heavily involved in major infrastructure projects across the region and beyond, including railways, ports, and hotels. Experts note that these projects, often awarded to companies with ties to President Erdogan, are part of a broader geopolitical strategy for Turkey to assert itself as a regional power and present a modern alternative to the West.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the growing divide between establishment Democrats and a rising populist-progressive wing, drawing parallels to the Republican Tea Party movement a decade ago. The recent victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary is cited as evidence of this trend, which is fueled by widespread anger among the Democratic base and a desire for new leadership. While the original Tea Party had a clear set of policy goals, the current progressive energy is more disparate, though it is unified by frustration with current congressional leaders and a focus on working-class affordability issues. The article considers whether this grassroots momentum could lead to a wave of primary challenges against incumbent Democrats.</p>

          <p>FIFA has significantly cut ticket prices for the Club World Cup semi-final match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Standard tickets, which were priced as high as $473.90 earlier in the week, were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament, which has seen similar price drops for other quarter-final matches. In contrast, tickets for the other semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still start at nearly $200, highlighting the variable demand for different matchups in the competition.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of revelers, dressed in traditional white and red attire, gathered in Pamplona, Spain, to kick off the annual San Fermín bull-running festival. The celebration began with the firing of the "chupinazo" rocket, signaling the start of nine days of festivities. The event, made famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel "The Sun Also Rises," is highlighted by the daily "encierros," or bull runs, where participants sprint alongside six charging bulls through the city's streets. The festival attracts a large number of international tourists and also includes bullfights, cultural entertainment, and extensive partying.</p>
