          <p>David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, will have his felony obstruction charge reduced to a misdemeanor following his arrest during a protest of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. Supporters, including the AFL-CIO and Governor Gavin Newsom, had condemned the original charge as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Trump administration. Huerta's legal team stated they will seek a speedy trial to vindicate him, framing the case as an act of retaliation intended to suppress dissent and punish opposition.</p>

This temporary shutdown severs the primary route between Orange and San Diego counties, forcing motorists onto a lengthy detour via Interstate 15 that could turn a 23-minute drive into a journey of over two hours.

          <p>A viral social media trend known as the "Great Lock-In" encourages people to use the autumn season to establish healthier routines and reset before the holidays. Experts advise starting with small, realistic goals, such as a short daily walk or adding more produce to meals, to build confidence and momentum. The focus is on progress rather than perfection, avoiding burnout by pacing oneself and anchoring new habits in daily life. The ultimate goal is to make these positive changes sustainable beyond the season by integrating them into a long-term lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A coalition of activist groups is organizing thousands of 'No Kings' protests across the United States to demonstrate against what they describe as abuses of power by the Trump administration. The rallies focus on issues such as immigration policies and the deployment of federal troops in cities. In response, Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have labeled the events as "Hate America" rallies, while organizers maintain they are exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest and that such criticism may actually increase turnout.</p>

          <p>Millions of people are expected to participate in over 2,600 'No Kings' demonstrations across all 50 U.S. states and in several other countries to protest the policies of the Trump administration. The movement, supported by top Democratic leaders, cites concerns over immigration, healthcare cuts, and the unprecedented use of federal power. The White House has dismissed the events, with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson characterizing them as 'hate America' rallies, a claim that organizers say is a distraction from the administration's failures.</p>

          <p>As the average price of a Halloween costume rises, Austin resident Christophe Waggoner is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes for free. For the past nine years, he has been thrifting clothes and materials, then redesigning them into unique costumes at his home. Waggoner hosts events where children can pick out a costume, saying this year has been his busiest yet. He spends over $5,000 annually on the project but believes the effort is worthwhile to ensure every child gets a chance to celebrate the holiday.</p>

These funds are designed to offer more structural protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. The manager suggests that the demand for income and defense against equity drawdowns is a long-term trend, but advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields.

          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute found that men are more inclined than women to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The primary motivating factor cited by men was financial savings, reflecting current economic pressures. However, experts suggest a deeper reason is that heterosexual men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when they are single compared to women.</p>
