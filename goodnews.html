          <p>Faced with water scarcity and population growth, St. George, Utah, is exploring wastewater recycling as a solution. The city plans to build a wastewater reclamation plant to treat effluent for irrigation, eventually integrating it directly into the drinking supply. This initiative, costing over a billion dollars, aims to alleviate pressure on the Colorado River and Lake Mead. Other western cities are also adopting conservation rules and incentivizing lawn removal to manage water resources, highlighting the increasing importance of wastewater reuse in drought-stricken regions.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling across English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2. This plan, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed ecosystems. The proposal aligns with a UN Ocean Conference goal to place a third of international waters into protected areas by 2030. President Macron called for a moratorium on deep sea mining at the conference, reflecting growing concerns about the environmental impact of such activities.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining popularity among people without diabetes, with companies claiming they can revolutionize health.

CGMs may be useful for those highly sensitive to carbohydrates, needing extra motivation to eat healthier, or seeking more awareness about their diet, but the data can be confusing and misleading.</p>
