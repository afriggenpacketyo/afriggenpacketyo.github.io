          <p>David Ellison, CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, has swiftly initiated major strategic changes, including a $7.7 billion deal for UFC mixed martial arts rights and securing a Call of Duty film franchise. These moves, along with hiring top talent and exploring an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, aim to redefine entertainment and boost the company's streaming service, Paramount+. Analysts note this aggressive investment phase is crucial for the company, which was "starved" under previous management, though it may initially impact stock performance.

          <p>As of September 11, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,638.08 per ounce, a value subject to constant fluctuation due to various market dynamics. Gold traditionally serves as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, particularly appealing during economic uncertainty or geopolitical turmoil. Factors influencing its price include supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Investors often turn to physical gold during unstable periods, making it crucial to monitor these influences for timely investment decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is significantly impacting the apparel industry, leading to a noticeable shift in clothing size demand. Resale stores are reporting an influx of larger sizes and increased demand for smaller ones, a phenomenon dubbed the "Ozempic effect." While some retailers are beginning to stock fewer extended sizes on racks, experts caution against reducing plus-size offerings, emphasizing that this segment remains underserved. The article notes that the long-term effects on the industry depend on drug accessibility and sustained demand, as manufacturers work to lower prices and expand distribution.</p>

          <p>High-level economic talks between the US and China in Madrid next week are critical for a potential lasting trade settlement, as their current truce approaches its November expiry. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng will discuss tariffs, export controls, and TikTok, alongside cooperation on money-laundering networks. Analysts suggest these four-day discussions must intensify to achieve more than just another extension of the truce, potentially paving the way for a summit between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. The outcome could significantly shape future US-China economic relations.</p>

          <p>South Africa has reopened the inquest into the 1977 death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, 48 years after he died in police custody. Apartheid authorities initially claimed Biko died from accidentally hitting his head, a narrative widely disputed. The National Prosecuting Authority aims to provide closure to the Biko family and society, revisiting the case where Biko was held naked and shackled, and received medical attention only after 24 days. This move follows President Cyril Ramaphosa's inquiry into whether previous ANC administrations blocked prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes, seeking truth and justice for historical atrocities.</p>

          <p>As the US Social Security trust fund faces depletion by 2033, potentially leading to benefit cuts, discussions are intensifying on how to ensure its solvency. Raising the retirement age is a common proposal, but this approach disproportionately impacts lower-income individuals who have shorter life expectancies, resulting in a larger percentage cut to their benefits. Experts highlight the growing life expectancy gap between rich and poor, making across-the-board age increases regressive. A proposed solution involves raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, combined with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, to achieve bipartisan reform.

          <p>Demand for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is soaring, with $540 billion in new money during the first half of 2025, yet financial experts caution investors against common pitfalls. Many investors mistakenly assume all ETFs are alike, failing to "look under the hood" at underlying assets, which can range from broad indexes to narrow, risky sectors. Another frequent error is "chasing performance" based on past returns, which are not indicative of future results. Experts also warn that frequent trading, despite ETFs' intraday liquidity, can "quietly erode returns" and undermine their low-cost, tax-efficient benefits as long-term investments.
