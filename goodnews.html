          <p>CVS Health surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for both earnings and revenue, prompting the company to raise its adjusted profit forecast for the fiscal year. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy operations and noted improvements within its Aetna insurance division. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in technology and labor as key factors, though the health services segment saw a decline. The company continues its cost-cutting plan while also strategically acquiring new stores in certain regions.</p>

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly showed that its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offers significant cardiovascular benefits, performing favorably against its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and also showed a lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. While the results strengthen Mounjaro's case as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients, clinicians note that factors like cost and insurance coverage will still influence prescription decisions. The data is expected to be submitted to regulators by year-end.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 90-day extension for trade negotiations with Mexico, delaying the imposition of broader punitive tariffs. Following a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump confirmed that existing tariffs on fentanyl, cars, and certain metals will remain during this period. The article provides wider context, noting that this extension comes as dozens of other countries, including Canada and Brazil, face imminent tariff deadlines. The move highlights the ongoing complexities and uncertainties in the administration's global trade policy, with deals still pending with major partners like China.</p>

          <p>As Amazon prepares to release its second-quarter earnings, Wall Street is closely watching the impact of U.S. tariff policies and the company's significant investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts are also monitoring the performance of Amazon Web Services, which saw slower growth last quarter, and the company's advertising revenue. While tariff uncertainty poses a risk to its e-commerce business, some analysts believe Amazon may have gained market share from Chinese competitors affected by new trade rules. The company's guidance for the third quarter will be a key indicator of its outlook on these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent article examines impostor syndrome, the psychological pattern where high-achieving individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud. The piece notes that this feeling is common across many professions, particularly among those in technical fields and perfectionists, and can lead to anxiety and burnout. To combat these feelings, the article suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of growth, and building a supportive community of peers. These methods can help reframe one's perspective from self-doubt to a focus on continuous learning and improvement.</p>

          <p>The College Sports Commission, the new agency overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, has relaxed its standards regarding athlete agreements with third-party collectives. The updated guidance broadens the definition of a "valid business purpose," allowing payments from companies that promote or endorse goods for profit, even if the company itself is not yet profitable. This change avoids a potential return to court after plaintiff attorneys argued that earlier, more restrictive guidance was an incorrect interpretation of the lawsuit settlement that enabled direct payments to players.
