          <p>Dilly Dally, an adolescent loggerhead sea turtle, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after undergoing rehabilitation at a Florida turtle hospital. The turtle had its front flipper amputated due to predator wounds and was cared for at Loggerhead Marinelife Center. A satellite tracking device was attached to Dilly Dally's shell to monitor its journey and migration patterns. The Loggerhead Marinelife Center partnered with the Smithsonian to get the satellite tag, which was attached on Tuesday, allowing researchers to study the behavior of three-flippered turtles.</p>

          <p>A contributor challenges the narrative that trade with China significantly harmed American manufacturing, arguing that the negative effects have been exaggerated. The author cites a comprehensive review suggesting that the "China shock" had modest employment effects and that the decline in manufacturing began before China's WTO entry. The piece contends that technological advances and shifting consumer demand were more significant factors. The author concludes that misguided protectionism, based on a misdiagnosed problem, poses a greater threat to the U.S. economy than Chinese imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has approved the mass production of its first home-grown 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100. This development is a significant milestone for China's aviation ambitions, especially in light of US export restrictions on key technologies. While the AES100 differs from jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts consider it a major step forward for the country's aviation sector. The development reflects China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines.</p>
