          <p>This article delves into the intricate debate over portable benefits for gig economy workers, highlighting new Republican-led proposals that would permit companies to offer perks like retirement funds without reclassifying workers as employees. The piece reviews the history of this issue, from earlier progressive concepts to the current environment where labor unions often oppose such measures, fearing they legitimize worker misclassification. While several states are piloting voluntary benefit programs, the federal legislative path is still fraught with contention, leaving many independent contractors with uncertain protections.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla has awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, a substantial stock package consisting of 96 million shares, currently valued at approximately $29 billion. This action follows a Delaware judge's decision six months prior to invalidate his 2018 pay package, which was deemed improperly negotiated. To claim the new vested shares, Musk must pay Tesla the exercise price of $23.34 per share, the same price set in the original, now-voided, compensation plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, an industrial mechanic and union leader, is launching an independent campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, where he will challenge the incumbent Republican, Pete Ricketts. Following a surprisingly competitive performance against the state's other senator in 2024, Osborn is running on a working-class platform, emphasizing the contrast between his own life experiences and those of his wealthy opponent. His candidacy serves as a significant test for the appeal of a non-party-aligned, blue-collar message in a staunchly Republican state.</p>

          <p>A high-tech development zone in Beijing, known as E-Town, is initiating a "shopping festival" for robots to encourage the adoption of humanoid technology. The program will provide substantial subsidies, as much as 250,000 yuan (US$34,700), to both corporate and individual customers who purchase products from leading Chinese robotics firms like Unitree and UBTech. This initiative is a component of a larger national strategy by China to bolster its leadership in and integration of robotics and advanced manufacturing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of American children indicates that despite their significant screen time, their foremost wish is for more unstructured, face-to-face play with their peers. The article posits that the prevalence of a "phone-based childhood" stems directly from parental restrictions on real-world autonomy due to safety concerns, which leaves electronic devices as the primary outlet for unsupervised social interaction. It also notes a rising movement of community initiatives and nonprofits dedicated to reinstating independence and outdoor play, which are vital for children's healthy development.</p>

First Minister John Swinney commended her for her "invaluable contribution," and she will continue to fulfill her duties as an MSP and in her current government role until the election.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The worldwide production of farmed fur has undergone a staggering decline, dropping from 140 million animals in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This dramatic shift is credited to a combination of effective animal welfare campaigns that successfully lobbied major fashion houses to adopt fur-free policies and the implementation of legislative bans on fur farming in Europe. The industry's decline was further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms and evolving economic and political conditions in key markets like Russia and China.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has revealed plans to intensify efforts to internationalize its currency, the yuan, capitalizing on what it sees as growing instability in the U.S. dollar.

This renewed emphasis is significant, as it is the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a distinct focus in the bank's midyear policy outline. (not investment advice)</p>

The data shows that the prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts among 12-to-17-year-olds dropped from nearly 13% to 10%, accompanied by a slight reduction in suicide attempts. While mental health experts are optimistic about this trend, they also emphasize that millions of teens continue to struggle and encounter substantial obstacles in accessing necessary mental health care.</p>
