          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most recent tariffs exceeding 100% for 90 days, a move that has boosted stock prices and eased trade war tensions. Struggling Japanese automaker Nissan plans to cut 20,000 jobs globally due to the impact of U.S. tariffs, while Japan is experiencing a boom in gold investments amid economic fears spurred by the tariffs. Prime Minister Modi stated that India will monitor Pakistan's moves following a cease-fire agreement, and Japan's rice prices have fallen for the first time in 18 weeks due to government measures. Sharp will sell a symbolic LCD plant to its parent company Foxconn, and Japan and Guinea-Bissau have pledged closer ties ahead of a development conference.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring drugmakers to reduce their prices to match those in other high-income countries, threatening to impose steep caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. He aims to expand the "most favored nation" concept, ensuring the U.S. pays the lowest global price for prescription drugs. The White House plans to develop new rules to revive price caps in Medicare and allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the most favored nation price. Drug manufacturers oppose this, arguing it could stifle innovation and harm biotech companies. The industry suggests addressing foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal church's migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing its commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. President Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program. The church views this as preferential treatment over other refugees and will conclude its resettlement grant agreements with the US federal government by the end of the fiscal year. The church will find other ways to serve immigrants, such as those already in this country and those stranded overseas.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the so-called reciprocal duties for 90 days, in a surprise move that appears to be an about-face from their bitter trade war, prompting a surge in stock prices. The agreement means that the United States will cut its recent tariffs on China, imposed since Donald Trump's second presidency started in January, to 30 percent from 145 percent. The United States will also maintain a separate 20 percent levy imposed over what it views as Beijing's insufficient efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl into the country. The vice premier said the talks, which marked the first in-person interaction between senior officials of the two countries since the Trump administration ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports, was "an important step toward resolving differences" and laid the foundation for deepening cooperation, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.</p>
