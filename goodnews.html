        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing announced a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, with revenue rising 35% to $22.75 billion, driven by the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," highlighting improved production stability and a focus on safety and quality. The company is increasing its 737 Max output to the FAA's limit of 38 per month and aims to generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including delays in the certification of its Max 7 and Max 10 models.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new hospitality initiative called "Green Apron Service" as part of CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to revitalize sales by focusing on customer experience. The program involves training baristas to provide warmer, more engaging interactions to foster customer loyalty and make Starbucks visits a regular habit. This push is supported by technological upgrades, such as Smart Queue algorithms for better staffing, and operational changes to ensure faster service. The company hopes this focus on human connection will differentiate it in a competitive market and reverse a trend of declining sales.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase, already the largest credit card issuer in the United States, is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs.

          <p>With a large number of high-rate certificates of deposit (CDs) set to mature, financial experts are advising savers on their next steps. Instead of allowing funds to automatically roll over into new CDs at potentially lower rates, consumers should actively evaluate their options. These include shopping for new CDs at different banks, considering more liquid high-yield savings accounts, or exploring other investment vehicles. Experts stress the importance of comparing rates and terms to maximize returns, especially with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international research team has found strong evidence of a female-centered society at Catalhoyuk, a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey. By analyzing DNA from 131 skeletons buried under homes, scientists discovered that households were formed on a matrilineal basis, with men moving in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The findings, published in the journal Science, indicate that women held an elevated societal position, challenging common assumptions about social structures in prehistoric communities.</p>

          <p>India, home to about 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its population increase to over 3,600, according to a recent census report. Despite this conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain for the species' long-term survival. The primary threats are habitat fragmentation and destruction caused by deforestation, infrastructure projects, and agricultural expansion, which isolate tiger populations and disrupt breeding. Conservationists emphasize that protecting the quality of ecosystems, not just population numbers, is crucial for securing the future of these charismatic mammals in the wild.</p>

          <p>A psychologist with over two decades of experience has highlighted several common but potentially harmful lies that well-meaning parents tell their children. Phrases such as "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" and "big kids don't cry" can set unrealistic expectations and discourage healthy emotional expression. The article argues that such statements can lead to self-blame, an inability to ask for help, and the suppression of valid feelings. Instead, the expert advises parents to foster resilience by being realistic, validating emotions, and teaching the value of both independence and interdependence.</p>

          <p>Mortgage lending experts predict that rates will likely remain relatively stable through August, with a potential for a slight decrease depending on the Federal Reserve's actions. While many homebuyers have been hoping for a significant drop, the Fed has remained cautious due to inflation concerns, particularly around the impact of new tariffs. Most analysts do not expect a cut in the federal funds rate until at least September. Experts advise prospective buyers to focus on what they can afford now rather than trying to time the market, as a future rate drop could also increase competition and home prices.

          <p>A lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three key strategies for success. The first involves aggressively cutting down on meetings by making them shorter, more efficient, or replacing them with written updates. The second strategy is redesigning work processes to be more efficient, such as re-engineering factory workflows or reassigning tasks based on individual strengths. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, freeing up time to focus on what truly matters for the business.</p>

          <p>Four rare Sumatran tiger cubs have been born at Manor House Wildlife Park in Pembrokeshire, Wales, marking the largest litter for the species ever born in the UK. The birth is a significant event for the critically endangered species, with fewer than 400 individuals estimated to be left in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching. The zoo, which is part of a crucial European breeding program, had been trying to breed the parent tigers for over eight years. The arrival of the four healthy cubs brings new hope for the genetic diversity and survival of Sumatran tigers.</p>
