          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 13:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The live-action adaptation of Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" has become the first Hollywood film of 2025 to earn over $1 billion worldwide, with a sequel already in development. The movie has grossed $416.2 million domestically and $584.8 million internationally, setting a record as Disney's highest-grossing live-action film in Mexico. Its success builds on the enduring popularity of the Stitch character, whose merchandise sales reached $2.6 billion last year, and continues a trend of family-friendly films dominating the box office. The film's massive opening weekend even surpassed "Top Gun: Maverick" for the biggest Memorial Day weekend debut ever.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Analyze Nutritional Differences Between Cane Sugar and High-Fructose Corn Syrup</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:57:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch to cane sugar in the U.S., health experts are weighing in on whether it is a healthier alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians note that while there are minor chemical differences—corn syrup has a slightly higher fructose content—both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. Both are considered "empty calories" with a high glycemic index, contributing to conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Some research suggests high-fructose corn syrup may be associated with higher levels of inflammation, but experts ultimately agree that moderation of all added sugars is key.</p>

          <p>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is partnering with Olympic gold medalist Tara Davis-Woodhall to expand his women's-only track and field competition, Athlos, to include field events. The new initiative will feature a long jump competition in New York City's Times Square, a move prompted by Davis-Woodhall's outreach to ensure field events received proper recognition. Ohanian, who credits his wife Serena Williams for opening his eyes to the investment potential in women's sports, is determined to elevate the profile of female athletes between Olympic cycles. Davis-Woodhall expressed excitement that the partnership is helping bring mainstream awareness and her dreams for the sport to reality.</p>

          <p>Stargazers are preparing for the annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the year's most impressive celestial events, which will be active from July 17 to August 24. The phenomenon occurs as Earth passes through the debris trail of Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, causing small particles to burn up in the atmosphere and create bright streaks of light. For optimal viewing, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights, preferably between midnight and sunrise. No special equipment is needed, but clear skies are essential. Viewers should allow their eyes to adjust to the darkness for the best chance of spotting the meteors radiating from the constellation Perseus.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Germany have signed a comprehensive treaty that includes plans to establish a direct passenger rail link between London and Berlin. The agreement, known as the Kensington Treaty, also aims to tighten laws against people-smuggling gangs and strengthen defense and trade ties. A joint task force will be created to work out the logistics for the new train service, which could offer a greener alternative to flying within the next decade. The treaty also facilitates easier travel through e-gates and promotes school exchanges, marking a significant step in resetting post-Brexit relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to pass the GENIUS Act, a historic bill to regulate cryptocurrency, after overcoming a rebellion from right-wing Republicans. The legislation, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, was initially stalled when a dozen conservatives blocked a procedural vote. After a meeting with President Trump, the holdouts relented, allowing the bill to advance. The drama highlighted internal GOP divisions but ultimately cleared the path for the first major crypto legislation to be passed by Congress, a move President Trump has urged to position the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.

          <p>Netflix is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street closely watching the company's revenue growth following recent price increases and the expansion of its advertising-supported tier. Analysts expect earnings of $7.08 per share on $11.07 billion in revenue, representing significant year-over-year growth. While Netflix no longer provides quarterly subscriber updates, investors are focused on the performance of its ad-supported plan as a key driver for future revenue. The company's stock has performed strongly this year, rising over 40% as it navigates a landscape where consumers are increasingly conscious of their spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," describing it as a deliberately unromantic take on the romantic comedy genre. The show follows an impulsive American, Jess (Megan Stalter), who moves to London and enters a relationship with a cynical musician, Felix (Will Sharpe). The review notes the characters' near-total lack of screen chemistry, arguing it's an intentional choice to reflect a modern, pragmatic approach to love. Instead of giddy infatuation, the relationship is built on inertia and mutual need, presenting a vision of love for a cold, precarious economic climate where stability and security trump passionate connection.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will sell their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a significant discount. The new program will bypass insurance and pharmacy benefit managers, cutting the monthly cost from a list price of around $606 to $346 for uninsured or self-pay patients. The move comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices and threats of tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. While the discounted price offers savings, it remains substantially higher than the negotiated Medicare price set to take effect next year and the average out-of-pocket cost for commercially insured patients.

          <p>United Airlines beat second-quarter earnings estimates and issued a new full-year forecast, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that the world is "less uncertain" than it was earlier in the year. The airline now expects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, a sign of returning confidence after a rocky start to the year saw weaker domestic demand. While second-quarter revenue of $15.24 billion fell slightly short of expectations, the optimistic outlook suggests a strong finish to the year. The carrier noted that operational constraints at its Newark hub significantly impacted its profit margin during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
