        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is advocating for a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queue times. Negotiations are ongoing ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with potential agreements also covering trade, security, and youth mobility. Conservative MP Alex Burghart expressed concerns that the deal could lead to the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed an EU deal that included a youth mobility scheme and extending fishing rights for the EU in British waters would mean that "to a large extent, Starmer will be betraying Brexit".</p>

          <p>A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, discusses the importance of press freedom and the subtle ways it's being undermined in democracies. He notes that while overt censorship and violence against journalists are common in authoritarian societies, democracies face subtler forms of repression, such as selective use of investigatory powers and frivolous lawsuits. Sulzberger emphasizes the Times' commitment to independent journalism, stating their loyalty is to the truth and the public's right to know it. He also expresses concern about the challenges facing the news industry, including the collapse of the business model and growing distrust.</p>

          <p>Experts are weighing in on whether the middle class should be worried about the future of Social Security, which is facing increasing financial strain. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2035, potentially leading to reduced benefits, delayed retirement ages, or higher taxes. Economist Shawn DuBravac notes that Social Security won't disappear entirely, but benefits could be cut unless action is taken. Middle-class Americans, particularly those without pensions or significant savings, could be most affected by these changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert discusses the potential of vagus nerve stimulation for stress reduction, explaining the vagus nerve's role in regulating bodily processes and initiating the body's "rest and digest" response. While vagus nerve stimulation devices are used to treat conditions like epilepsy and migraines, some promote exercises involving head and neck movements as natural activators. However, current research is limited, and these techniques likely help through various mechanisms, not just increased parasympathetic activity. Proven methods to prompt the body‚Äôs relaxation response include slow, diaphragmatic breathing, cold water exposure, and humming.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations for babies due to widespread availability of vaccines during pregnancy and monoclonal antibody treatments. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months dropped by as much as 56%, and in newborns, hospitalizations decreased by as much as 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach noted fewer critically ill children from RSV this year. The study shows that increased use of RSV prevention products can significantly protect young babies from severe illness.</p>
