        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have reached their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 individuals in the 2024-25 period. Alongside prosecutions, TfL also issued over 13,000 penalty notices as part of a broader crackdown on what it calls a crime that robs the system of vital investment. The transport authority has committed to reducing fare evasion rates and is expanding its enforcement teams to target the most persistent offenders and improve safety across the network. This renewed focus on enforcement follows a significant drop in prosecutions during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has approved the acquisition of engineering software firm Ansys by the U.S. tech company Synopsys, a significant deal in the semiconductor industry. The approval comes with specific conditions aimed at protecting Chinese clients, requiring the merged entity to honor all existing contracts and not reject renewal requests from Chinese customers. This decision is viewed as a sign of easing tensions in the ongoing tech war between the two nations, particularly after Washington recently lifted some export restrictions on electronic design automation (EDA) software, a critical technology for China's chip-making ambitions.

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Downplays Concerns of Chinese Military Using Firm's Advanced Chips</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:07:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has minimized U.S. fears that China's military could leverage his company's advanced AI chips, stating that Beijing cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In a recent interview, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, arguing they are counterproductive to maintaining America's global tech leadership by limiting access to the large Chinese market. His comments come as Nvidia faces significant revenue loss due to these restrictions and as he prepares for another visit to China, carefully navigating the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing.

          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession by posting a 1.4% economic expansion in the second quarter of 2025, reversing the previous quarter's contraction. The growth was largely driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which benefited from businesses front-loading exports amid global trade uncertainties and a temporary pause on certain tariffs. Despite the positive figures, which beat analysts' expectations, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. Officials warn of significant downside risks stemming from the unpredictable nature of international trade policies and their potential impact on the export-oriented economy.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of dense urban structures, including multistory 'tower houses,' in the lost ancient Egyptian city of Imet, now known as Tell el-Fara’in. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, a British and Egyptian team identified the buildings, which date to the Ptolemaic Period and were designed to house a growing population. The excavation also unearthed granaries, a ceremonial road linked to the cobra goddess Wadjet, and various artifacts, providing new insights into the complex urban, religious, and economic life of the Nile Delta region. These findings are helping to reshape the understanding of this period in ancient Egyptian history.</p>

The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of slack, with job vacancies falling to their lowest level since 2021 and some businesses reducing pay rises.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations, driven by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary tariff reprieve that slowed the decline in trade with America. While exports to the U.S. fell, shipments to Southeast Asia and the European Union surged. Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase in 2025, rising 1.1%. Despite the positive data, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, citing continued uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies and the potential for the front-loading momentum by exporters to fade.

Consumers in Norway have been won over by the competitive pricing and advanced technology of the Chinese models, posing a significant challenge to established Western brands, including market leader Tesla.

          <p>India's government has proposed a new rule that would require all new air conditioners to have a default minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). The initiative aims to generate massive energy savings in a country with over 1.4 billion people and the world's fastest-growing market for AC units. Officials estimate that for every degree an air conditioner's temperature is raised, energy consumption is reduced by about 6%. The move is part of a broader effort to manage soaring electricity demand, which is driven by rising incomes and increasingly extreme summer heat, and to curb the nation's reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
