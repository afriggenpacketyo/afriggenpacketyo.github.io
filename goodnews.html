          <p>The Senate is considering a bill that would eliminate taxes on tip income, a proposal championed by both Trump and Harris during the 2024 campaign. If enacted, workers could deduct all qualified tips from 2025 through 2028, provided they are reported. While this could provide relief to moderate and middle-income tipped workers, analysts point out potential issues such as income misclassification and shifts in compensation structures. The article notes that the impact may be limited as many low-income tipped workers already fall below the federal income tax threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a reversal of cuts to winter fuel payments following political pressure. The cuts, which previously affected over 10 million pensioners, will be eased by adjusting the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again. The move comes after criticism that the policy contributed to Labour's losses in recent local elections, and details are expected to be clarified at the autumn Budget. The original cuts were implemented to save an estimated ¬£1.4 billion by restricting eligibility to those receiving pension credit and other income-related benefits.</p>

          <p>The FDA is directing Pfizer and Moderna to broaden the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines regarding the risk of heart inflammation, primarily in males aged 16 to 25. The updated warnings are based on a study from last year and new agency data, indicating a higher incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in this age group following vaccination. The FDA emphasizes that the rate of these conditions is around 38 cases per million doses in males aged 16-25, although the CDC describes these occurrences as rare.</p>
