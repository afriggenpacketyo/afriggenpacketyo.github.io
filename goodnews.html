          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by strengthening its defense ties with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of a broader maritime cooperation program, Australia has donated equipment and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029. This move reflects an expanding strategic partnership as the two nations approach their 80th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2026. Analysts note that both countries are motivated to enhance their alliance, which includes cooperation on marine protection, operational training, and maritime law, amid regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly prioritizing technology-focused majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular, reflecting China's economic boom and entry into the WTO. Now, amid intensified tech competition with the United States, the state-driven system is funneling students into engineering disciplines. This strategic focus aims to bolster China's industrial development and secure its position in future technological advancements, reshaping the country's academic landscape and workforce.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is marking a major milestone, celebrating 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation, the longest such record in the UK and Ireland. Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded temperature and air pressure, creating an invaluable climate dataset. This tradition continues today, with a human observer still logging data by hand, providing a unique contrast to modern automated stations. The records have captured significant meteorological events, from major storms to the first observations of noctilucent clouds, and have contributed to the development of meteorology, including the invention of the four-cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers finished the first half of the baseball season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants, securing a key series win. Despite underperforming relative to high expectations and dealing with an injury-plagued pitching staff, the team holds the best record in the National League and a comfortable lead in the NL West. The game encapsulated their season's duality: a stellar performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was nearly undone by a struggling bullpen. However, the Dodgers' potent offense ultimately secured the win, positioning them as favorites for a repeat championship despite areas needing improvement.</p>

King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the president and first lady at Windsor Castle. This invitation is seen as a strategic diplomatic move by the British government to maintain strong ties with the Trump administration. Unlike other leaders, Trump is not expected to address Parliament, as it will be in recess for party conferences. The visit, which will include full ceremonial honors, is anticipated to draw protests, similar to his first state visit in 2019.</p>

The album feels rawer and more improvisatory than previous efforts, with murky production and demo-like tracks that reflect a messy period in the singer's life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces a scrappy, idiosyncratic sound, putting his crooning vocals over spacey, chillwave-inspired grooves. The album's lyrics touch on the pressures of his scrutinized marriage and confrontations with paparazzi, presenting an authentic and often beautiful, if sometimes messy, musical statement.</p>
