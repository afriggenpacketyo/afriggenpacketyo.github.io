          <p>This article explores the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their impact on workplace communication and trust. Corporate buzzwords, intended to convey meaning concisely, often create confusion and impede trust among employees, especially Gen Zers who rely on straightforward answers. Studies show that lower-status employees tend to use more jargon, possibly due to insecurity. The author suggests replacing buzzwords with clear, human language and encourages reading poetry for genuine metaphors, advocating for straightforward communication over distracting jargon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major strategic defence review amid growing concerns about global security threats, including a resurgent Russia and China's ambitions. The review will emphasize modernizing the armed forces, increasing national resilience, and bolstering public involvement in protecting the country. While some critics suggest the review may not deliver substantial changes, it is expected to underscore the UK's commitment to NATO and the importance of nuclear weapons. The government aims to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and potentially to 3% by 2034.</p>

Despite Trump's accusations against China, the S&P 500 rose for the week and the month, driven by positive earnings reports from companies like Nvidia and Costco. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but concerns remain about the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. The Fed is taking a "cautious approach" to monetary policy, as indicated in the minutes from its May meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
