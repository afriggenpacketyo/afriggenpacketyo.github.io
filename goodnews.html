          <h2>House Republicans Retreat from Aggressive Medicaid Cuts Amid Party Divisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:39:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has backtracked on aggressive Medicaid cuts initially considered by House Republicans to fund President Trump's domestic agenda, highlighting deep divisions within the party. Facing pressure from moderate Republicans, Johnson ruled out reducing federal payments to states for working-age adults eligible through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and changing the federal payment structure to a flat fee per person. This decision underscores the difficulty Republicans face in achieving their spending cut targets while maintaining enough votes to pass legislation. The move has drawn criticism from ultraconservative Republicans, who argue for deeper cuts to Obamacare programs to fund Trump's tax and spending plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company is increasing prices on three vehicle models produced in Mexico, citing higher U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles as a contributing factor. The price increases, affecting the Maverick, Bronco Sport, and Mach-E, will be up to $2,000 per model and apply to vehicles built after May 2. Ford expects a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year, although it is absorbing some of the tariff-related costs rather than passing the entire burden onto consumers. The Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on vehicles assembled abroad in March.</p>

          <p>According to a higher education expert, interest rates on federal direct undergraduate loans could decrease slightly to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, compared to the current 6.53%. Graduate student loans are also expected to see a similar decrease, with rates potentially falling to 7.94% from the current 8.08%. These rates, set annually by the government, are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note. The slight decrease could offer some relief to borrowers, reducing monthly payments and overall repayment amounts.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US due to debt and increased competition from weight-loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The bankruptcy process will eliminate $1.15 billion of the company's debt while establishing new repayment terms with lenders. WeightWatchers assures that it will remain fully operational throughout the process, with no disruption to its members. The company attributes its challenges to the rapidly evolving weight management landscape, marked by the rise in popularity of weight-loss injections.</p>

The decision comes after concerns that the federal hiring freeze would halt the program, which is vital for training aspiring public health workers and staffing the agency.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, despite President Trump's calls for lower borrowing costs. The decision comes as policymakers assess the economic impact of Trump's trade policies and rising economic risks. The Fed acknowledged increased uncertainty in the economic outlook, citing potential risks of higher unemployment and inflation. While the jobless rate remains low and the labor market solid, the Fed is closely monitoring economic data and the evolving outlook before making further adjustments to interest rates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rates, prospective home equity borrowers have more time to analyze their options between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While home equity loans were traditionally better during rate pauses due to their fixed rates, the current climate suggests a HELOC may be more advantageous. The likelihood of a Fed rate cut in the near future and the lower average interest rates of HELOCs make them a cheaper borrowing option. Borrowers should carefully consider their ability to manage variable rates before choosing a HELOC.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady could influence mortgage rates, although the Fed doesn't directly set them. While the rate pause may create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, they are primarily influenced by the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and various economic factors. Inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty all play a role in shaping mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers and homeowners should stay informed, improve their credit scores, and shop around for the best mortgage rates.</p>
