          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf will now lead the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. He had previously cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time." Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regrets his previous statement and will take on a more public role for the party, appearing more frequently in the media.</p>

          <p>A study by Inspired Taste has uncovered America's diverse pasta preferences, revealing strong regional favorites across state lines. Spaghetti leads as the national favorite, dominating in 20 states, particularly in Mississippi where it is favored by 55% of residents. Penne closely follows, preferred in 17 states, especially in the Pacific Northwest like Washington and Oregon. The study also found that elbows are the least favorite, with no state picking it as its top choice, while fettuccine dominates in California and rotini is favored in South Dakota, Alaska, and Montana.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to remembrance policies, with three new initiatives aimed at recognizing and symbolically healing historical injustices. These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing and compensating returnees from French Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt" dating back to 1825. While some view this as social maturity, others suggest that symbolic initiatives are easier to pass than structural reforms. These efforts highlight France's ongoing engagement with its complex past.</p>
