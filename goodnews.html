          <p>President Donald Trump delivered remarks after the White House revealed Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in various deals with the United States, following Trump's visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A significant agreement is a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting equipment and services from numerous U.S. defense firms, almost doubling Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget. The deals highlight the strengthening economic ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with the defense agreement poised to significantly bolster the Saudi military's capabilities.

          <p>General Motors is set to introduce a new EV battery technology, lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells, aimed at reducing costs and improving the profitability of its electric SUVs and trucks. GM plans to use the new batteries in full-size electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ starting in 2028. These batteries utilize more abundant and cheaper minerals like manganese, reducing the reliance on cobalt and nickel. GM anticipates being the first to market with this technology, which promises to deliver premium range and performance at a more affordable cost.</p>

The end of the exemption, initiated by President Trump, aims to address concerns over fentanyl flow and unfair competition with U.S.-based sellers.

          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 2.3% from a year earlier. Economists, however, warn that tariffs levied by President Donald Trump could reignite inflation. A Yale Budget Lab report suggests current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800 over the short term. Despite a temporary trade deal with China, core CPI inflation is expected to rise to 3.5% by the end of 2025.</p>

          <h2>U.S.-China Tariff Truce Offers Temporary Relief and Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>A tariff truce between the U.S. and China provides some relief to businesses but also prolongs economic uncertainty. Beginning May 14, the U.S. will reduce its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will lower its tariff on American goods to 10%. The 30% tariff is not permanent and will be reevaluated in 90 days, with the potential for further price hikes. The truce is expected to improve consumer confidence and reduce the odds of a U.S. recession, but companies still face challenges in planning for the future.</p>

          <h2>Czech Republic Considers Arms Industry as New Economic Driver</h2>

          <p>The Czech Republic's arms production is booming, potentially complementing or replacing the automotive industry as the main economic driver. While car production has recently declined, the arms industry has experienced significant growth following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Arms production is expected to continue growing, creating new jobs and utilizing the workforce freed up by the automotive sector. The shift comes as the Czech government increases defense spending and seeks to modernize its military.</p>
