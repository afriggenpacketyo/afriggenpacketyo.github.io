          <p>The White House has confirmed President Trump signed an executive order extending the pause on new tariffs against Chinese imports. This 90-day delay prevents a significant tariff hike that was set to expire at midnight. The extension was an anticipated result of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm, providing more time for the two nations to reach a broader trade agreement and de-escalating immediate economic pressures.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to gold bars from Switzerland and other countries. The initial customs ruling had caused uncertainty in the precious metals market, leading to a record high in gold prices. Following the president's announcement via a social media post, gold futures experienced a notable decline, settling lower and alleviating industry concerns about disruptions to the international flow of physical gold.</p>

While both platforms focus on sports, ESPN's service will be an all-in-one app with its complete live programming, whereas Fox One will stream content from its existing networks without original exclusives.</p>

          <p>Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for UFC events in a landmark seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. The agreement places 13 headline events and 30 fight nights on the Paramount+ streaming service, with select fights also airing on the CBS broadcast network. A significant change under this deal is the elimination of the pay-per-view model for UFC, making all fights accessible to Paramount+ subscribers. This aggressive content acquisition signals Paramount's strategy to bolster its streaming platform's appeal against competitors in the market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury documents related to the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that releasing the materials would not provide meaningful new information about the crimes of Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, stating there is no "there there." The judge suggested the government's motion might be aimed more at the illusion of transparency than at genuine disclosure, as the documents do not identify new victims, clients, or details about the criminal operation.</p>

CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive performance to a recovering industry box office and a 26% increase in attendance, indicating a strong rebound from post-pandemic and strike-related struggles.

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that certain seniors could benefit from considering a reverse mortgage, particularly amid rising living costs and economic uncertainty. The article identifies three groups: those needing to supplement fixed retirement incomes, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. It frames the financial tool as a way to unlock home equity without requiring monthly loan repayments, though it notes the decision carries risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests this transactional approach is characteristic of the Trump administration but is unlikely to be replicated in other sectors, as semiconductors are viewed as a unique strategic technology under strict export controls.</p>
