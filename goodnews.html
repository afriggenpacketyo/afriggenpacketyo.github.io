          <p>A recent analysis of top-tier academic publications from 2015 to 2024 reveals that researchers of Chinese origin represent a significant majority of the world's leading artificial intelligence experts. According to the report, 65 of the top 100 AI scientists are of Chinese descent, with 50 of them currently working at institutions within China. The study evaluated over 96,000 high-level papers and citations from prestigious journals and conferences to assess the impact and contributions of each scientist. This data underscores China's growing influence and leadership in the highly competitive field of AI research and development.</p>

          <p>Nvidia challenger Groq has announced the establishment of its first European data center in Helsinki, Finland, marking a significant step in its international expansion. The AI semiconductor startup, known for its Language Processing Units (LPUs) designed for high-speed inference, is partnering with Equinix to meet rising demand for AI services in Europe. Groq's CEO highlighted the company's speed of deployment and less constrained supply chain as key advantages over competitors. This move aligns with Europe's push for sovereign AI capabilities and reflects the growing competition in the AI inference chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people necessary time to grieve without needing to use sick leave. Campaigners, including MP Sarah Owen and musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a crucial step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness.</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British teenager sentenced to a year in a Dubai prison, has been released and has returned to the United Kingdom. Fakana was jailed for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. He received a royal pardon from Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, during the Eid holiday. The campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported his case, stated the situation highlights the need for legal reforms regarding foreign nationals and the criminalization of tourists for such offenses.</p>

          <p>U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan is being hailed as a hero for his actions during the deadly flash floods in central Texas. The 26-year-old rescue swimmer from New Jersey personally saved an astonishing 165 victims, serving as the sole triage coordinator on his first-ever rescue mission. His efforts were concentrated at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp that was severely impacted by the flooding which has claimed dozens of lives. Ruskan's courage was publicly praised by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for embodying the spirit of the Coast Guard.</p>

          <p>The distinct taste of American chocolate compared to its European counterparts stems from different production methods and consumer preferences. U.S. chocolate often contains butyric acid for a longer shelf life, which imparts a slightly sour note that can be off-putting to European palates, along with higher sugar content. In contrast, European chocolatiers in countries like Switzerland and Germany emphasize traditional processes and adhere to stricter EU regulations on cocoa content. The article also explores emerging chocolate markets in India and Africa, which are developing their own unique flavor profiles and consumption habits.</p>

          <p>A team of 14 engineers from the United Kingdom has begun work on a sophisticated F-35B fighter jet that has been stranded at an airport in Kerala, India, for over three weeks. The state-of-the-art aircraft was diverted due to bad weather during a sortie from the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier and subsequently reported a technical issue. After an initial assessment by the ship's engineers failed to resolve the problem, the specialist team was flown in with necessary equipment. The prolonged stay of the $110 million stealth jet has generated considerable public curiosity and discussion in India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States' recent decision to lift a ban on selling American jet engine components to China is set to significantly aid the production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. This bilateral agreement allows the state-owned manufacturer Comac to import critical parts from a GE-invested joint venture, enabling it to fulfill hundreds of existing orders for its narrowbody jet. While this move secures Comac's production pipeline in the short term, analysts suggest that previous U.S. export restrictions have likely reinforced Beijing's determination to accelerate the development of its own indigenous engine technology.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to discuss the controversial ownership of the Darwin Port during his second official visit to China next week. Sources indicate that addressing the potential government-influenced sale of the strategic port, currently leased to a Chinese company, is a key item on his agenda alongside trade discussions with President Xi Jinping. The visit, scheduled around July 15, is seen as a diplomatic effort to maintain positive momentum in the bilateral relationship between the two countries.

          <p>Jason Chapman, a world-renowned British ecologist specializing in insect migration, has taken a full-time position at Nanjing Agricultural University in China. His move highlights China's growing prominence in the natural sciences and its investment in cutting-edge research technology. Chapman was particularly drawn by the university's advanced entomological radar, which can track flying insects, a technology in which he says China is now the world leader. This career decision reflects a broader trend of global scientific talent being attracted to the resources and opportunities available at Chinese research institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new gene therapy delivered via a single injection has successfully improved hearing in children and adults with a specific form of congenital deafness, according to a clinical trial. The therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals from the ear to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed considerable hearing improvement within a month, with one seven-year-old regaining almost full hearing. Researchers are optimistic that this safe and well-tolerated method could eventually be adapted to treat other common forms of genetic deafness.</p>
