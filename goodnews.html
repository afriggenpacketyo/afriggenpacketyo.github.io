        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent NIH-funded study indicates that manual acupuncture can provide significant relief for adults suffering from chronic low back pain, positioning it as a viable alternative to opioid medications. The trial, involving 800 older adults, found that participants receiving acupuncture reported greater reductions in pain-related disability and intensity compared to those receiving usual medical care. The use of acupuncture in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past two decades, with many patients turning to the traditional technique for its strong safety profile and benefits in improving physical function and reducing anxiety.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, declared a 'heat hazard' due to extreme temperatures and humidity, Formula 1 drivers are split on using a new cooling vest system. Red Bull's Max Verstappen expressed his dislike for the system and opposes plans to make it mandatory, citing design flaws and lack of space in the cockpit. In contrast, Mercedes driver George Russell plans to use the vest, noting his team has made other improvements to mitigate cockpit temperatures that have previously exceeded 60°C. The debate highlights the physical challenges drivers face and the ongoing efforts to enhance safety.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly paused its offensive military activities in Gaza to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages, according to a senior Israeli official. This move is not an official ceasefire but a tactical adjustment intended to advance a peace deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt to finalize the deal's technical details, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas expected to begin Sunday. In response, President Trump issued a warning to Hamas, urging them to move quickly on the hostage release or risk all negotiations being called off.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a historic milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, who succeeds the ELCA's first female leader, will serve a six-year term leading the nation's largest Lutheran church body. His election is seen as a significant step for a church that is over 95% white but has been working to support multicultural ministries. Curry will face challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including declining membership and navigating theological divisions over social issues.</p>

          <h2>Costco to Offer Weight-Loss Drugs Ozempic and Wegovy at Substantial Discount</h2>

          <p>Costco has partnered with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the typical retail price. Members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket can purchase a four-week supply for $499. This move aims to provide an affordable and authentic alternative to cheaper, compounded versions of the drugs, which have raised safety concerns. With demand soaring and many insurance plans not covering these medications, Costco's entry into the market is expected to significantly increase access for many Americans.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The 3,000-year-old tomb is one of the largest in the valley and had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led conservation project began. The restoration involved over 260 specialists who worked to preserve the site's exquisite wall paintings, which are considered some of the finest from the Eighteenth Dynasty. The tomb complex includes a main burial chamber for the king and two others for his queens, Tiye and Sitamun.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a U.S.-proposed peace deal, including the release of all hostages, while indicating other points require further negotiation. The U.S. views the response as positive, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated Israel is preparing to implement the plan's first phase. In response to the development, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to ensure the hostages can be released safely. The proposal calls for a phased Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of a technocratic Palestinian body to administer Gaza.</p>

          <p>Mohammed Kudus, who joined Tottenham Hotspur from West Ham for £55m, is quickly proving to be one of the team's most influential new players. After providing four assists in previous games, the Ghana international scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 victory over Leeds. Manager Thomas Frank praised Kudus as the team's "best offensive player so far," highlighting his importance, especially with other key creative players injured. Pundits like Wayne Rooney have lauded his dribbling ability, strength, and work rate, noting he has brought a new dimension to the Tottenham midfield.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have responded with a mixture of hope and fear to news that Hamas has partially accepted a U.S.-led peace proposal. While expressing optimism that a deal could finally bring their loved ones home, many remain wary of potential setbacks after previous disappointments. Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is believed to be alive in Gaza, described the situation as fragile but said she feels hope for the first time in months. The families are urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to engage in swift negotiations to secure the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have added veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw to their roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. The future Hall of Famer was left off the wild-card series roster but is expected to provide a steady presence and left-handed depth out of the bullpen. Kershaw's inclusion marks a likely final postseason appearance before his anticipated retirement. The Dodgers also added left-handed pitcher Anthony Banda to the roster, reinforcing their pitching staff to counter the Phillies' lineup of left-handed hitters like Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market continued its rally, with the S&P 500 reaching its 29th record high of the year despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare sector saw a significant surge after a deal was announced to exempt Pfizer from certain tariffs, boosting stocks like Danaher and Eli Lilly. The technology sector also performed strongly, driven by the continued investor interest in artificial intelligence, which also lifted utility stocks due to the high power demands of AI data centers. The market's resilience suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts suggest that American investors should consider increasing their exposure to international markets. Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that "home bias is about as bad as it's ever been," with the average investor having too much capital concentrated in the United States. Analysts point to potential value abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India, which are experiencing rapid growth driven by large populations and expanding consumer classes. This perspective encourages diversification as a strategy to mitigate risk and capture growth opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national, on human-smuggling charges may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The ruling allows Ábrego's lawyers to seek evidence to prove the case is vindictive, following his successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation. Judge Waverly Crenshaw cited "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general that seemed to link the charges to Ábrego's legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the political battle over the administration's aggressive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, lower electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to meet these demands and also pledged to improve public services and reduce the size of its Cabinet. The alliance leader urged protesters to disperse, expressing gratitude for the intervention to resolve the issues.</p>
