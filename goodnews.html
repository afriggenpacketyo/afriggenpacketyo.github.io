          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in August, contracting by only 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop seen in July. This figure surpassed economists' expectations of a 1.9% contraction, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but at a decelerated pace. Meanwhile, imports also contracted less than the previous month but more than forecasted, falling by 5.2%. The data provides a mixed but cautiously optimistic signal for the Japanese economy ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is expected to maintain current rates.

          <p>Online ticket platform StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, establishing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. This pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range and comes after several previous delays in its attempts to go public. The company, which was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The move signals a potential rebound in the IPO market, which has seen renewed activity after a slowdown caused by high inflation and rising interest rates.</p>

          <h2>Appreciation: Robert Redford's Career Was Defined by Complex Roles and a Rejection of Simplistic Stardom</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This appreciation of Robert Redford, who died at age 89, reflects on a career defined by his deliberate choice to pursue complex roles rather than coast on his conventional good looks. The article argues that Redford consistently sidestepped easy, heroic parts to explore flawed and morally ambiguous characters in films like "The Candidate" and "Downhill Racer." By doing so, he used his all-American image as a Trojan horse to make audiences question their own ideals and the nation's hidden rot. His legacy includes not only his iconic acting roles but also his work as a director and his foundational support for independent cinema through the Sundance Institute.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney has announced that five partially built homes in Laurel Canyon will be demolished, ending a two-decade-long legal fight. The structures, part of a larger development plan from the late 1990s, were ordered to be torn down in 2003 after developers failed to complete a required environmental impact assessment. Despite the order, a series of subsequent owners attempted to restart construction on the dilapidated properties. A recent plea agreement with the current developers has finally mandated the demolition, which must be completed by August 2026, resolving a long-standing issue for the local community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase could be the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, a milestone currently dominated by tech giants. Cramer cited the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, as key drivers. Currently valued at around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has seen significant gains this year amid a broader rally in the banking sector. The analyst argued that the "real rocket fuel" for the bank's growth is the expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple as Wall Street shows increased willingness to invest in the financial sector.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has shifted its strategic focus from an attack-oriented style to a more pragmatic, defensive approach under new manager Thomas Frank. This change is evident in the team's recent performance, including a 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games this season. Players have highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," a stark contrast to the more free-flowing but defensively vulnerable style seen under the previous manager. While effective in preventing goals, this cautious approach has resulted in fewer shots on target, presenting a trade-off between defensive solidity and offensive excitement for the fans.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT and signaling that Google is gaining significant traction in the consumer artificial intelligence race. The app's popularity surged following recent updates, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana that attracted 13 million new users in just four days. This milestone, combined with strong user engagement, has bolstered investor confidence, helping Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently join the exclusive group of companies with a $3 trillion market valuation. The success marks a key victory for Google as it competes directly with early AI frontrunners.</p>

          <p>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the league's decision to allow players to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan is an important move for the sport's global visibility. This will be the first time in 12 years that NHL players compete in the Games, a return driven by a strong desire from the players themselves to represent their countries. The decision was also facilitated by a new agreement with the IOC that improves commercial arrangements and player living conditions. While the league will have to pause its season for two weeks, Bettman believes that being on one of the world's biggest stages will ultimately be worth the difficulties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent sports investor Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that major sports teams or ownership groups will go public. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly as private entities, and publicly traded teams often trade below their intrinsic value. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which may not align with the short-term earnings focus of public markets. This structure is better suited for intergenerational assets like NFL teams, which can now also raise capital through approved private equity investments.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is rolling out enhanced safety features for ChatGPT users under the age of 18, automatically directing them to a version with more restrictive content policies. This edition will block sexual content and, in severe cases, can alert law enforcement to ensure user safety. The company is also introducing parental controls that allow parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage limits, which will be available by the end of September. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny from regulators like the FTC over the potential negative impacts of AI chatbots on young people, and after a lawsuit from parents who allege the chatbot contributed to their son's suicide.</p>
