          <p>Las Vegas Sands has broken ground on a new $8 billion resort in Singapore, a standalone project adjacent to its existing Marina Bay Sands property. The development will feature a 55-story tower with 570 all-suite hotel rooms, luxury retail, and extensive meeting and gaming facilities. A key attraction will be a 15,000-seat arena and a public rooftop space with an observation deck and gardens. This major investment aligns with Singapore's strategy to significantly boost tourism revenue by attracting high-value business and leisure travelers with world-class entertainment and attractions.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced his intention to sell more technologically advanced chips to China, going beyond the recently reinstated H20 AI processor. Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology evolves, the products available to the Chinese market should also improve, despite ongoing U.S. export controls. The company has been navigating geopolitical tensions, developing compliant chips like the H20 to maintain access to China's significant AI market, which Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion. The comments come as U.S. officials suggest a strategy of allowing sales to ensure Chinese firms remain dependent on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intervened in a Canadian agricultural dispute, urging the government not to cull 400 ostriches exposed to avian flu. The flock, located at a farm in British Columbia, was ordered to be destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the farm's owners have launched a legal battle, arguing the birds should be studied for potential antibodies and treatments. Kennedy, in a letter to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, supported this view, stating that significant scientific knowledge could be gained by observing the ostriches in a controlled environment rather than eradicating them.</p>

          <p>An Emirates flight from Dubai to Hong Kong was forced to divert to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after being unable to land at its destination. Flight data indicated the Boeing 777 aircraft made at least two unsuccessful landing attempts and circled the area before changing course. The crew and passengers remained in Kaohsiung overnight before successfully flying to Hong Kong the following day. While the airline did not specify a reason for the diversion, aviation observers suggested that challenging weather conditions, including sustained winds of approximately 12 knots, may have been a contributing factor to the landing difficulties.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has visited a landmine clearance project in Angola, following in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana, who brought global attention to the issue in 1997. As a patron of the Halo Trust, Harry met with families and children living near one of Africa's largest minefields, emphasizing that children should not live in fear. Landmines left over from Angola's civil war continue to pose a daily threat, with an estimated 60,000 casualties since 2008. The prince's visit highlights the ongoing humanitarian effort to clear the remaining minefields and honors his mother's iconic work on the same cause.</p>

          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing trade and investment deals while setting aside major political disputes. The agreements reportedly include expanded market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff cuts. Notably, there has been no public discussion of the contentious issue regarding the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin, which Australia wants to reclaim on security grounds. Analysts suggest this pragmatic approach is an effort by Beijing to find common ground and stabilize economic relationships amid its ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled following a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting some coastal communities to evacuate to higher ground. However, officials later downgraded the alert to an advisory, as the shallow depth of the earthquake meant that large, widespread waves were not expected. The U.S. Coast Guard stood down its evacuation response after the threat passed, and no major damage or injuries have been reported from the seismic event.</p>

          <p>A massive afforestation project in northern China, known as the 'green great wall,' has been successful in combating desertification but is now linked to an unintended negative consequence: a surge in hay fever. Chinese scientists have confirmed that pollen from the artemisia plant, widely used in the project for its resilience, is a primary cause of allergic reactions in the region. A new study has identified five specific volatile components in the plant's pollen that trigger allergies, which have worsened for many residents since 2018. The findings highlight the complex ecological and health trade-offs of large-scale environmental engineering projects.</p>

          <p>A new official photograph of Queen Camilla has been released by Buckingham Palace to celebrate her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson earlier this month, shows the Queen smiling at her private home in Wiltshire. Dressed in a turquoise outfit, she is seen leaning against a gate in a field. Unlike last year, when her birthday coincided with the State Opening of Parliament, she is expected to celebrate the occasion privately. The release comes after a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, who is still undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An innovative solution to meet the massive energy demands of the artificial intelligence boom is emerging from recycled electric vehicle batteries. In Nevada, AI cloud platform Crusoe is powering two data centers using solar panels paired with used EV batteries supplied by Redwood Materials. This approach provides a reliable, renewable power source that can be deployed quickly, offering an alternative to building new gas-fired plants. As millions of EVs reach the end of their road life, their batteries, which still retain significant capacity, can be repurposed for this kind of large-scale energy storage, creating a scalable and more sustainable way to fuel AI's growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation to help thousands of military veterans avoid foreclosure on their homes. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs abruptly ended a pandemic-era assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other homeowners to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The new law will establish a program allowing veterans to move their delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current. Veterans' groups and the mortgage industry have praised the move as a crucial fix that provides a proven safety net for those who have served.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully rescued after authorities followed a trail of handwritten notes the woman left behind. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS led them down a remote road in the Stanislaus National Forest where they lost their signal. The woman's notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guided the search-and-rescue team to their location. The successful outcome was also attributed to the fact that the mother had notified someone of her travel plans, a key pre-trip safety measure that helped authorities narrow the search area.</p>
