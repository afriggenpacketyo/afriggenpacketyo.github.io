          <p>Space technology firm Firefly Aerospace has raised the target price range for its initial public offering, now aiming for a valuation of over $6 billion. The company, known for its Alpha rockets and lunar landers, now expects to price its shares between $41 and $43, which could raise nearly $697 million. This increase reflects strong investor interest in the space sector, which has seen renewed activity with companies like Voyager going public. Firefly has secured partnerships with NASA and major defense contractors, and its revenues have grown significantly, although its net losses have also widened as it continues to expand its operations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weak July jobs report, market sentiment is growing that the Federal Reserve will be compelled to cut interest rates in September to support a slowing economy. This expectation helped fuel a broad-based market rally, with analysts suggesting a rate cut could boost stocks. Meanwhile, a Morgan Stanley analysis indicates that major tech companies are projected to dramatically increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure through 2026. This sustained spending signals strong confidence in AI's long-term profitability and is seen as a positive driver for both tech giants and related industrial sectors that support data center construction.

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a dramatic surge of over 20% after President Donald Trump praised its new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called it the "'HOTTEST' ad out there," leading to a significant rebound for the company's stock, which had been struggling. The campaign, with its slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism for its perceived double entendre. The event highlights the powerful and often unpredictable impact of political commentary on consumer brands and their market performance, especially in a polarized cultural landscape.

          <p>Sixteen-year-old Cooper Lutkenhaus, a high school junior from Texas, delivered a stunning performance at the U.S. Track & Field Championships, setting a new under-18 world record in the 800 meters. With a time of 1:42.27, he finished second in the men's final, nearly catching champion Donavan Brazier after an electrifying final-stretch surge from seventh place. His performance, which was the fourth-fastest in U.S. history overall, has been hailed as one of the most impressive athletic feats ever for his age group. Lutkenhaus will now become the youngest American to compete in the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo this September.</p>

          <p>After a decade of research, scientists have identified the cause of a mysterious disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along the Pacific coast of North America since 2013. A new study reveals that the culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found in shellfish and causes the sea stars' arms to fall off before they disintegrate. The epidemic devastated over 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing 90% of its population, leading to an explosion in sea urchins and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery offers hope for developing interventions to restore sea star populations and their ecosystems.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the ongoing AI-driven construction boom reveals that Northern Virginia and Maricopa County, Arizona, are the primary hotspots for new data centers in the United States. As of the end of 2024, there were 1,240 data centers built or approved nationwide, with Virginia hosting 329 and Arizona's Maricopa County hosting 48. This unprecedented build-out is fueled by massive investments from tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. However, it comes at a significant environmental cost, as these facilities consume vast amounts of electricity and water, raising concerns about their long-term sustainability and impact on local communities.</p>

          <h2>European Union Postpones Retaliatory Tariffs on U.S. Goods for Six Months</h2>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were set to take effect this week. This move provides time to implement the trade agreement reached in late July between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The deal aims to de-escalate trade tensions by setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods, though negotiations on key items like car parts are ongoing. An EU spokesperson stated the delay is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic while the details of the agreement are finalized.</p>

          <h2>Economist Explains the 60% Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Impact on Borrowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:57:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 60% rule is a key regulation for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), limiting borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds within the first year. This FHA guideline was designed to prevent seniors from depleting their home equity too quickly, promoting long-term financial stability. However, in an economy with rising costs, this rule can challenge borrowers who need a larger lump sum for immediate needs like paying off debt or funding home renovations. An important exception allows homeowners to exceed the 60% limit if the funds are used to pay off existing mandatory obligations like a primary mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>
