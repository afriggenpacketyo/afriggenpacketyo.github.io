          <h2>Ed Sheeran's Co-writer Relieved as 'Thinking Out Loud' Copyright Case Ends</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," in which it held a copyright interest, but the court refused to hear an appeal. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the trials had "haunted" her for 10 years, despite the song changing her life. The court agreed with earlier findings that the chord progression and harmonic rhythms in Gaye's song are too commonplace to be legally protected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's handling of the Iran-Israel conflict is viewed by some analysts as a strategic move to leverage the United States in nuclear talks. According to Amit Segal of Israel‚Äôs Channel 12, Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a green light to strike Iran after the expiration of a 60-day window for serious negotiations over Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump has maintained a "masterful ambiguity" about his role, reminiscent of Sir John Lawrence's policy of "masterful inactivity." He is offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans, and he is using the military and diplomatic tools to influence Iran's behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel experts offer advice on how to manage flight delays and cancellations, as air travel is getting notably worse, with an increase in canceled flights throughout 2024. They recommend multitasking by rebooking flights online while in line for customer service, calling customer service hotlines in other languages, and seeking assistance at airport lounges. Travelers should know their entitlements from the airline and check their travel insurance coverage, choose early-morning flights, and consider alternative transportation options if necessary. Booking direct with the airline is also advised to ensure better assistance in case of disruptions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been "completely counter-intuitive" because he plays for their "biggest opponent," Al-Nassr. Despite being linked with a possible deal for the 40-year-old Portugal forward due to FIFA's additional transfer window, Al-Hilal opted against pursuing the move. The executive emphasized the importance of making decisions that align with the team's long-term goals and competitive dynamics, rather than short-term tournament considerations. He also mentioned challenges in reinforcing the team due to players' holiday mindsets and excessive financial demands.</p>

          <p>British Steel has secured a five-year contract worth ¬£500 million to supply train tracks for Network Rail, potentially safeguarding the future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract will begin on July 1, with British Steel providing 80% of Network Rail's track needs. This deal follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners, Jingye. The government has not ruled out full public ownership but is also seeking private investors to fund steelmaking operations, which has increasingly been raised as a national security issue.</p>

Van Poortvliet will join the team in Dublin to help prepare for their match against Argentina. He was England's first-choice nine before the 2023 Rugby World Cup but had to withdraw due to an ankle injury, giving Alex Mitchell an opportunity. Van Poortvliet's recent form during Leicester's run to the Premiership final earned him a place on the bench at the back end of England's Six Nations campaign.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs report that the tide has turned for China's private enterprises as regulatory restrictions are being lifted to help non-state firms pursue breakthroughs in cutting-edge technology and expand their international presence. The private sector's "animal spirits" are making a return, with investment patterns suggesting a renewal led by capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, research and development spending, and heightened fundraising activity. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policy and regulatory frameworks, forceful macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. China‚Äôs private sector accounts for roughly 60 per cent of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product and 80 per cent of urban employment.</p>

The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The US will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed".</p>
