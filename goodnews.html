          <h2>Experts Highlight the Realities of Antidepressant Use and Withdrawal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 13:40:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist, Dr. Awais Aftab, addresses the complexities surrounding antidepressant use, acknowledging their potential to be lifesaving for some patients while also highlighting the less discussed side effects and withdrawal challenges. The article emphasizes the lack of research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek advice from online communities. Aftab criticizes the medical community's reaction to Robert F. Kennedy's claims about antidepressant withdrawal, urging a more serious engagement with patient concerns and advocating for more research into medication safety and long-term effects. He argues that the public deserves balanced advice about psychiatric medications, acknowledging both their benefits and trade-offs, to avoid losing credibility with patients whose lives have been negatively impacted. </p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a chaotic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car intervention after Oscar Piastri initially led the race. The safety car, triggered by a collision between Alonso and Lawson, allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and gain the lead. Verstappen faced a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to last place. Antonelli's race was significantly hampered by the collision with Verstappen, preventing him from making his pit stop and ultimately finishing out of the points.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign ministry responded to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's criticism of Germany's decision to label the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party as a "confirmed rightwing extremist group."

The ministry emphasized that the decision followed a thorough and independent investigation and that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped, drawing on lessons from Germany's history. The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, designated the AfD as a "confirmed rightwing extremist" force, citing the party's xenophobic stances as incompatible with the country's constitution.</p>

Farage's party has already been ahead of the Conservatives in the polls for months and many Tories acknowledge privately it's not impossible that Farage's party could replace them in the medium term. Reform UK has also won its first parliamentary by-election, narrowly taking Runcorn and Helsby from Labour by just six votes after a recount.

          <p>Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's use of tariffs as a weapon in global commerce, stating that "trade should not be a weapon" and that it is neither right nor wise. The comments came at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, where Buffett acknowledged that the conglomerate faces potential hits from American trade policies. While Buffett defended the broader concept of global trade flows, he also noted that Berkshire's first-quarter earnings had dropped sharply. Despite the criticism, Buffett reiterated his long-standing praise of the United States as a land of opportunity.</p>

          <h2>Reform UK Gains Momentum in Local Elections as Traditional Parties Struggle</h2>

          <p>Reform UK has made huge gains in local elections held across England on 1 May, taking control of 10 councils and winning the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by just six votes. Labour and the Conservatives both suffered their biggest local election defeats, failing to hold on to any of the councils they controlled before the election. The Liberal Democrats picked up scores of seats and gained control of three councils, while the Greens more than doubled their number of councillors. The BBC's projected national share, an estimate of how the country would have voted if everywhere had had a local election, shows the Conservatives in fourth place.</p>

          <p>Reginald, the world's tallest living dog, and Pearl, the world's smallest living dog, both certified by Guinness World Records, met up for a playdate in Idaho Falls. Despite a three-foot height difference, the Great Dane and Chihuahua got along famously, engaging in tail wagging, sniffing, and scampering. Pearl, who stands at 3.59 inches, comes from a long line of short dogs, while Reginald measures in at 3-foot-3. The two-day meet-up was arranged by Guinness, and both owners were surprised by how gentle and friendly the dogs were with each other.</p>
