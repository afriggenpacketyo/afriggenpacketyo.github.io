          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following a first-quarter earnings report that fell short of estimates. The company cited "production fluctuations" leading to lower average selling prices as the reason for missing revenue and net income targets. While wafer shipments increased, SMIC forecasts a sequential revenue decline for the current quarter. The company attributed the growth in wafer shipments to customer demand influenced by geopolitical changes and government policies, with capacity utilization reaching 89.6%.</p>

          <p>China is actively pursuing a charm offensive in Europe, highlighted by celebratory events commemorating 50 years of diplomatic relations with the European Union. However, Xi Jinping's close ties with Russia remain a significant obstacle to meaningful rapprochement. While Europe shows some receptiveness to China's advances, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and China's support for Russia create a stumbling block. Despite the pageantry and warm exchanges, the underlying difficulties related to trade and geopolitics persist, complicating efforts to deepen cooperation.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight a new trade deal between the US and the UK, with varying interpretations of its significance. While some emphasize its historic nature and potential to save jobs, others note its limited scope and the continuation of tariffs. The deal includes concessions on car and steel exports but retains a 10% levy on most goods. Amidst the trade discussions, attention is also drawn to the selection of a new Pope and commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, with the King referencing the wartime generation and the need to protect their legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with Britain, aiming to reduce the burden of his tariffs and deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market, with Britain reducing non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains in place, with certain exemptions for British automakers. The deal is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Trump, but its limited scope raises questions about addressing broader trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, defying expectations despite increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump. The growth potentially strengthens China's position in upcoming trade talks with the U.S. in Switzerland. Some analysts attribute the export growth to transshipment through other countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Despite the resilience, expectations are that trade data will weaken in the coming months, emphasizing the need for a trade agreement between China and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Producers of tungsten products in developed nations are diversifying their supply sources after China restricted exports of critical industrial metals, including tungsten. The restrictions, part of China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have caused panic in the industry. With U.S. defense contractors facing a deadline to stop using Chinese tungsten, companies are seeking alternative sources. China accounted for the majority of global tungsten ore mined last year, highlighting the industry's dependence on the country.</p>

          <p>Analysts are evaluating the potential benefits and drawbacks of the new trade deal between the US and the UK for the American economy. While the deal aims to reduce tariffs and expand market access, some argue its impact will be limited, with the 10% import tax on most UK goods remaining intact. American carmakers expressed concerns about the deal making UK-made cars less expensive than models made in Mexico and Canada. Experts suggest the deal may offer more of a political victory for President Trump than substantive economic benefits.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are calling for a revision of World War II history, advocating for a start date of 1931, with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism. The call comes as countries around the globe commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This week, President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>
