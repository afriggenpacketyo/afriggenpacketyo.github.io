          <p>During a college football game, ESPN announcer Chris Fowler praised Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada's reliability just before a 32-yard field goal attempt. Zvada, who had a strong record from that distance, subsequently missed the kick, an event Fowler acknowledged as a potential "announcer jinx." The missed field goal was one of several setbacks for Michigan in their 24-13 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners. Oklahoma's quarterback John Mateer delivered a strong performance with three total touchdowns, securing a 2-0 start for his team while Michigan fell to 1-1.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 23:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of US and Chinese researchers has developed an innovative method for launching small, millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful burst of energy capable of propelling tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. This technique offers precise control over the launch and could also be adapted to make the robots swim.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a locked magnetic case, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches upon entering school, which remain locked until they leave the building and use a magnetic unlocking device. While educators report a positive change with more student engagement and less distraction, student reactions are mixed, ranging from acceptance to attempts to bypass the system. The measure aims to create a more focused learning environment by establishing phone-free spaces during school hours.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin is being interpreted as a significant diplomatic event for China, showcasing its growing influence and vision for a multipolar global order. The article suggests that China used the forum to present itself as a stable alternative to a US-led system, particularly amid perceived unpredictability from the Trump administration. A notable moment of camaraderie between China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and India's Narendra Modi was highlighted as symbolic of shifting geopolitical alignments. The SCO focuses on security cooperation and economic integration among its Eurasian member states.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special treatment after a viral video showed an adult woman taking a home run ball from him during a game against the Miami Marlins. After Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader hit the home run, footage showed a man retrieving the ball and giving it to the boy, only for a woman to confront them and take the ball away. In response, the Marlins staff gave the boy a gift bag, and after the game, Bader met him personally, gifting him an autographed baseball bat to make up for the incident.</p>

          <p>A new UK-based organization, "Sisters in Service," is providing a support network for female military veterans who now work in healthcare. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, a former Army officer and current NHS psychiatrist, the group aims to address the unique sense of isolation women can feel after leaving the armed forces. Members say the network offers a crucial connection with others who share similar experiences, which are often misunderstood by the public. The group helps women discuss their time on the front lines in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, challenging outdated perceptions of women's roles in the military.</p>

          <p>Both Ukraine and Russia are extensively using decoy military equipment to mislead each other in their ongoing war. Ukraine has deployed numerous fake weapon systems, including plywood models of M777 howitzers, to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive munitions like Lancet drones on worthless targets. These decoys are often assembled quickly on the front lines and placed in realistic-looking positions to enhance their effectiveness. Similarly, Russia uses imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, with officials estimating that up to half of the drones in recent attacks are cheap decoys.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis used his skills to create websites documenting Eucharistic miracles to spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The canonization process required the attribution of two miracles to his intercession, which Pope Francis approved. His story has inspired many young Catholics, who feel a connection to a saint who wore jeans and played video games.</p>

          <p>With Dame Anna Wintour stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades, the iconic fashion magazine faces a pivotal moment. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with popular culture, famously putting celebrities like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits the brand's prestige but must navigate a challenging media landscape where print magazines compete with social media. Malle reportedly plans to shift Vogue toward a less frequent, more collectible format to maintain its influence and relevance.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU travelers starting this autumn. The digital system will replace manual passport stamping for visitors to the 29-country Schengen Area. On their first entry under the new system, travelers from countries like the UK will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial image, at automated kiosks or with a border officer. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns that the initial registration process could cause significant delays at major border crossings.</p>
