          <p>The Trump administration has extended the tariff truce with China by 90 days, temporarily averting an immediate escalation in the trade dispute. The decision, confirmed by a White House official, came just hours before the previous ceasefire was set to expire. This extension follows recent trade negotiations between the two countries in Stockholm. Ahead of the announcement, President Trump had publicly urged China to significantly increase its purchases of American soybeans to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unconventional deal, giving the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Analysts view the arrangement as a transactional move typical of the Trump administration, securing market access for the companies while setting a new precedent. Investors reacted positively, seeing 85% of revenue as better than zero and a way to compete with Chinese rival Huawei. However, the deal raises long-term uncertainty about future government demands and China's reaction to what some view as an "indirect tariff." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in cannabis companies experienced a rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category under federal law. A decision is expected within the next few weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could ease tax burdens and stimulate investment in the industry. While the President cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his public support has generated significant optimism among investors and industry leaders like Tilray's CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

Bell's identity was confirmed through DNA analysis, bringing what his family described as closure to a 66-year-old mystery and highlighting the increasing frequency of such discoveries due to melting glaciers.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a new "first look" deal with Netflix, a different arrangement from their original 2020 contract. While some commentators have framed this as a potential demotion, industry insiders suggest it remains a significant partnership. This type of deal gives Netflix the first option on projects from the Sussexes' Archewell Productions and could include lucrative incentives, such as covering operational costs. The continued partnership indicates that despite divisive public opinion, Netflix still views Harry and Meghan as a valuable power couple capable of attracting global attention.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery. The theater chain posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% increase year-over-year, and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also made progress in managing its debt, pushing all 2026 maturities to 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising living costs, a reverse mortgage is presented as a potential financial tool for certain seniors. The article suggests three groups who could benefit: those needing to supplement a fixed retirement income, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash for unexpected costs, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. By borrowing against home equity, these seniors can access tax-free funds without incurring monthly payments. However, the article advises a full understanding of the risks before proceeding.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to review a Louisiana case on racial gerrymandering does not threaten the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but rather seeks to align with its original color-blind principles. The author contends that creating race-based "safe seats" for politicians betrays the act's text, which protects an individual's right to vote, not a group's right to proportional representation. The piece suggests that ending racial gerrymandering would move the U.S. toward a democracy where voters choose representatives based on values, not race.</p>
