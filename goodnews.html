        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is aiming to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology but faces significant obstacles that are slowing its progress compared to the U.S. and China. High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system create a challenging market for new mobility services. While German law permits Level 4 autonomy, deployments are limited to small, cautious shuttles on fixed routes, partly due to manufacturers' reluctance to release immature systems. Projects like NeMo in Paderborn are developing innovative concepts, but the industry is calling for nationwide government support to move beyond pilot projects.</p>

          <p>Reality television personality Gia Giudice revealed that she reached out to President Trump for assistance regarding her father, Joe Giudice, who was deported to Italy in 2019 and now resides in the Bahamas. She stated that her family was inspired to act after Trump granted a pardon to Todd and Julie Chrisley, giving them new hope for their own situation. Joe Giudice was deported after serving a 41-month prison sentence for fraud charges; though he moved to the U.S. as an infant, he never became a citizen. While Gia did not receive a response, her mother, Teresa Giudice, expressed pride in her daughter's effort to reunite their family.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book, psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses and debunks several viral mental health myths and misuses of "therapy-speak" that have spread on social media. He argues that concepts like "people pleaser," "love bombing," and "narcissist" have been oversimplified, leading to harmful applications in daily life. Nucci cautions against using a diagnosis as a complete identity, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and clarifies that therapy can provide tools for relationships but cannot replace the experience of dating itself. The article emphasizes the need for nuance and professional guidance over simplistic online advice.</p>

Boulter won the match in three sets, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4, overcoming a late-set challenge where she let a double break lead slip. After the match, Boulter expressed her satisfaction with the win, noting that it comes after a "tough couple of months" that included early exits at Wimbledon and the US Open.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have erased a 10-game deficit in less than a month to tie the Detroit Tigers for first place in the American League Central division. Cleveland secured a 5-2 victory over Detroit, fueled by a career-high-tying 12 strikeouts from pitcher Gavin Williams. The Tigers' collapse includes a seven-game losing streak and 10 losses in their last 11 games, while the Guardians have MLB's best record in September. The game featured a shaky performance from Tigers ace Tarik Skubal, who hit a batter in the face and committed several uncharacteristic errors as Cleveland rallied to take the lead.</p>

          <p>In Oregon's oldest unidentified-person case, police have recovered the partial remains of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," nearly 80 years after her murder. The woman's dismembered body was first found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, with the cause of death determined to be blunt-force trauma. The case went cold after critical evidence, including the victim's remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently located the likely interment site at a local cemetery, and the exhumed remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing in hopes of finally identifying the victim.</p>

          <p>Global defense stocks experienced a significant rally following President Donald Trump's unexpected declaration that Ukraine is positioned to win back all its territory from Russia. European defense firms, including Germany's Renk and Hensoldt, and Italy's Leonardo, saw their shares climb by over 3-5%. The market's positive reaction reflects a belief that this rhetorical shift could signal prolonged or increased military support for Kyiv. An executive from Hensoldt noted that the comments affirm the ongoing security threats posed by Russia and reinforce the need for a robust European defense sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High-end fashion brands are increasingly collaborating with creators of popular characters, like the monster-like Labubu dolls, to engage younger, digitally-savvy shoppers. This strategy taps into the viral appeal of "cute" culture on platforms like TikTok, turning relatively inexpensive collectibles into luxury accessories. Parisian maison Moynat is the latest to partner with Labubu's creator, following successful collaborations by brands like Omega with Snoopy and Loewe with Studio Ghibli. Experts note that these partnerships create emotional value and cultural relevance, which are highly prized by Gen Z consumers who view luxury as a reflection of their identity rather than just craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>In his first show back after a nearly week-long suspension, Jimmy Kimmel directly addressed the political pressure from the Trump administration that led to his removal from the air. This article analyzes his largely serious monologue as a firm defense of First Amendment rights, noting he ran "right at his critics" rather than offering a simple apology. Kimmel framed the issue not as a personal grievance but as a dangerous precedent of government interference with media, a stance that garnered support from across Hollywood. The piece suggests Kimmel prevailed in his power struggle with parent company Disney, returning on his own terms to confront a chilling moment for free speech.</p>

          <p>In a landmark medical achievement, doctors have successfully treated Huntington's disease for the first time using a novel gene therapy. The treatment, which involves a single, lengthy brain surgery, was shown to slow the clinical progression of the devastating neurodegenerative disease by 75% in a trial of 29 patients. This result could extend patients' quality of life by decades and potentially prevent symptoms if administered early. The therapy works by delivering a specially designed piece of DNA into brain cells to reduce levels of the toxic protein that causes the disease. Researchers at University College London described the results as "spectacular" and beyond their "wildest dreams."</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated the league may seek to begin renegotiating its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. The current 11-year, $111 billion deal with partners like Disney, Comcast, and Amazon runs through the 2033 season. Goodell stated that the rapidly changing media landscape necessitates flexibility, and an earlier renegotiation could add billions to the league's revenue. This move could significantly impact team valuations and salary caps, but would require agreement from all current media partners to open discussions ahead of schedule.</p>
