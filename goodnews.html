          <p>The government of Cambodia has announced its intention to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in helping to broker a ceasefire agreement that ended a recent border conflict with Thailand. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, thanked Trump for his efforts in bringing peace to the region after the deadliest clashes in over a decade. The ceasefire was negotiated after Trump urged both nations to end the fighting, which had killed at least 43 people.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Potato's Origin from Ancient Hybridization with Tomato Ancestor</h2>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary origin of the potato back to an ancient hybridization event that occurred approximately nine million years ago. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers discovered that a forerunner of the modern tomato crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This pivotal event was a key driver in the development of the potato's tuber, the edible part that has made it the world's third most consumed food crop. The findings were published in the scientific journal Cell.</p>

          <p>In a Leagues Cup match, Los Angeles FC (LAFC) drew 1-1 with Mexican club Pachuca before winning the subsequent penalty shootout 4-2. Despite the two points earned, LAFC is virtually eliminated from the tournament, as a win in regular time was needed to advance. Dennis Bouanga scored for LAFC in the 10th minute, with Elías Montiel equalizing for Pachuca in the 32nd. Both teams finished the contentious match with ten players after receiving red cards, with LAFC's coach calling his player's expulsion a "silly mistake."</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's order temporarily blocking the Trump administration's use of "roving patrols" for immigration enforcement across Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot stop individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or location without reasonable suspicion. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction would harm its enforcement efforts, noting the likelihood of future unconstitutional stops was "considerable." Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the decision, expressing hope it would reduce fear within immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user burnout with conventional dating apps like Tinder and Hinge, new platforms are emerging that prioritize in-person meetings over prolonged online chatting. A reporter details their experience with an app called Breeze, which sets up a date directly after a match, with messaging only enabled shortly before the meeting. This approach aims to combat issues like "ghosting" and the feeling of wasted time on endless, fruitless conversations. While the reporter's own date didn't lead to a romantic spark, the experience felt more human.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A truck carrying hot dogs caused a significant traffic disruption in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, after spilling its entire load across a major highway. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to scrape against a concrete divider, tearing it open and scattering the sausages onto the road during the Friday morning commute. Cleanup crews were dispatched to the scene, with the local fire chief noting that the spilled hot dogs were surprisingly slippery. A front-end loader was ultimately used to scoop the discarded wieners into a dump truck for disposal.</p>
