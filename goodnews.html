          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students from the foster care system as they begin their college careers. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, often unaware of the basic necessities like bedding, lamps, or cleaning supplies that dorm rooms lack. The initiative, which started from a small Amazon wishlist, now supports over 140 students, allowing them to select their own items to personalize their new living spaces. By addressing this practical need, the program aims to level the playing field, reduce feelings of otherness, and help foster youth feel more prepared and confident as they transition into higher education.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes the importance of a single morning habit for daily success: waking up early, no matter what. By getting up when her alarm goes off, she creates personal time to ground herself before the day's demands begin, which helps manage her anxiety. Salazar uses this extra time for non-work-related activities like reading or walking her dog, allowing for flexibility rather than a rigid routine. She advises that this approach prevents the feeling of failure that can come from not sticking to a strict schedule, setting a more positive and creative tone for the rest of the day.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are preparing to move to a new residence, the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them in a larger home but keeps them near their current Adelaide Cottage and the Lambrook School, which their three children attend. The relocation follows their 2022 move from Kensington Palace, aiming to provide a more private family life. The new home, which recently received approval for minor alterations, is situated in a natural setting that aligns with Princess Catherine's advocacy for the healing power of nature, especially following her recent cancer treatment.</p>

Facing the threat of the historic site being sold to developers, the couple used their life savings and the loan to purchase the theater in 2022. They have since modernized its business model by operating year-round and hosting community events like craft fairs and car shows to boost revenue. After an initial struggle, the theater became profitable in 2024, bringing in nearly $550,000 in revenue and ensuring the preservation of a piece of American film history.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo stated that football "showed its best side" after he was subjected to alleged racist abuse during a match at Liverpool's Anfield stadium. Following the incident, in which a 47-year-old man was ejected, Semenyo received widespread support from teammates, opposing players, and fans. The Ghana international, who scored two goals in the match, emphasized that the unified response from the football community was more significant than the abuser's words. The event has prompted renewed calls from figures like Premier League CEO Richard Masters for stronger measures to eradicate racism from the sport.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining traction and creating a "halo effect" for the brand. Analysts suggest Apple is feeling the pressure to innovate its own form factors, with rumors of a slimmer iPhone and a potential foldable model in 2026. Samsung's broader range of price points, from budget-friendly to premium, also allows it to target a wider consumer base than Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fugitive crime boss, Jamie Rothwell, was captured after inadvertently revealing his location by sending a selfie from his Barcelona apartment over the EncroChat encrypted network. Law enforcement agencies, having secretly compromised the network, used the photo to identify and locate him. Rothwell was running a multi-million-pound drug and weapons trafficking operation, which included AK-47s, and was linked to a gangland shooting where an innocent man was injured. His messages on the supposedly secure platform provided police with a detailed look into his criminal enterprise, ultimately leading to his extradition and a 43-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers three strategies for developing emotional endurance, the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. She suggests using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-frustrating space between not knowing and knowing. Kennedy also advocates for engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues from self-defeating to supportive. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds the body's tolerance for discomfort and fosters resilience over time in all areas of life.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia, which Trump described as a more durable solution than a ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call involving Zelenskyy and European leaders, who reportedly expressed support for U.S.-led security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump stated that if the discussions with Zelenskyy are successful, a subsequent meeting with Putin would be scheduled to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less and are increasingly concerned about its health effects, with a majority now believing even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend aligns with recent scientific consensus, including guidance from the World Health Organization, that no level of alcohol consumption is safe. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with reported drinking by high school seniors falling from 75% in 1997 to 42% in 2024.</p>

In a public letter, Engine criticized the company's flawed leadership, poor capital allocation on overpriced acquisitions, and the rejection of a previous takeover offer at a premium. The firm is pushing for a strategic overhaul that includes cost-cutting, portfolio optimization, board refreshment, and using free cash flow for stock buybacks instead of risky M&A. Engine suggests these changes could significantly increase shareholder value or, alternatively, the company should consider a sale. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities believe the remains belong to Benn, who was a 59-year-old businessman at the time of his disappearance. The remains have been sent for forensic examination, and Benn's surviving next of kin have been notified of the discovery.</p>

Experts believe the object, along with a similar piece found nearby in 2021, was a high-status item used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes and may have been deliberately buried.

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by fiber-optic cables, which will extend their range to nearly 100 kilometers. This technology makes the drones immune to Russian electronic warfare and jamming tactics, a critical advantage on the modern battlefield. The extended range is necessary because high-value targets have moved further from the front lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as increased weight and risk of snagging, the ability to conduct precision strikes deep behind enemy lines without fear of electronic interference represents a significant evolution in drone warfare.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with its murder rate on track to hit a 50-year low. This turnaround is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence and offering them intensive support services. This approach, combining social intervention with targeted law enforcement, represents a shift from past zero-tolerance policies. Despite the success, the program's future is threatened by recent federal budget cuts by the Trump administration, which have terminated grants for many of the non-profit partners essential to the city's violence reduction efforts.</p>

The number of homeless adults over 55 is rising due to soaring housing costs, lack of economic stability, and unforeseen life events.
