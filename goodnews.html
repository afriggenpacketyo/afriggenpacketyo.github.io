        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS has confirmed plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and those referred by GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat people in acute mental distress. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the initiative as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit them, underscoring the urgency of addressing mental health care access.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats," following US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides and is ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, saying his plan to raise tariffs on June 1 was set, while also suggesting a large investment in the US by a European company might lead to a delay.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting the creation of at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. A White House official indicated Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, despite previous national security concerns. Both steelmakers have welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers, the steel industry, and national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had previously reviewed the acquisition plan, which faced opposition from former President Joe Biden and the United Steelworkers union.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) tools to navigate global trade turbulence caused by tariffs. Tech firms are deploying AI to visualize global supply chains and understand how they are affected by tariff changes. Salesforce has developed an AI agent that can process changes for all 20,000 product categories in the U.S. customs system, enabling faster decisions on adjustments to global supply chains. Andrew Bell of Kinaxis said manufacturers are using machine learning to assess their products, materials, and external signals to simulate the impact of tariffs and potential alternative parts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit to it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more "me time," a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations, and a reevaluation of priorities following the coronavirus pandemic. Experts believe this change is positive, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the win came at a cost as their pitching staff endured unexpected obstacles.

Tanner Scott blew a three-run lead in the ninth, but the Dodgers ultimately prevailed with Teoscar Hern√°ndez hitting a go-ahead RBI double in the 13th.

The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb a spike in rice prices amid rising inflation. Koizumi intends to publish weekly retail rice prices by region and examine distribution channels.
