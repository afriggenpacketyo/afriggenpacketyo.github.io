          <p>Adolfo Macias, the notorious Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His agreement in a Quito court marks a significant step for President Daniel Noboa's government, which has declared war on the country's powerful drug mafias. Macias will be the first Ecuadorian extradited under a new law approved by referendum last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis has ranked the economies of all 50 U.S. states to determine which are best positioned to handle a potential recession, considering factors like GDP growth, job creation, fiscal health, and exposure to trade wars. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina topped the list, credited with strong growth, diverse economies, and relative insulation from international trade disputes and federal budget cuts. The report notes that while some states have booming economies, their high dependence on international trade or federal spending makes them more vulnerable to current economic uncertainties.

The designation includes the iconic Neuschwanstein Castle, which inspired Disney, as well as Herrenchiemsee Palace, Linderhof Castle, and the King's House on Schachen. Built in the 19th century, these architectural masterpieces were once criticized as extravagant but have since become major tourist attractions, drawing 1.7 million visitors in 2024. The new status, which Bavarian politicians have sought for 25 years, is expected to further boost tourism to these historic German sites.</p>

          <p>New online safety regulations are being implemented in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. Under the rules, enforced by Ofcom, companies must verify users' ages or face substantial fines. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules are already outdated, failing to fully address risks from AI chatbots, private messaging, or misinformation. While campaigners argue the measures don't go far enough, the government is reportedly already planning further legislation to address online addiction and algorithmic harms.</p>

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience identifies four surprising factors that can quietly damage intimacy in a relationship. These include excessive phone use which signals a lack of presence, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and unmanaged stress which can act as a major brake on desire. The therapist emphasizes that intimacy is more than physical and is essential for a thriving relationship. She suggests open communication and setting simple boundaries as key strategies to counteract these common intimacy blockers.</p>

          <p>According to a negotiation expert, securing a desired raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process spanning several weeks. Kathryn Valentine, CEO of Worthmore Strategies, advises that the initial conversation should aim to set the stage for success, not to finalize a deal. She recommends initiating discussions during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews, when budgets are often already set. The key to a successful negotiation is to be patient, document conversations, and schedule clear follow-up meetings to maintain momentum and hold all parties accountable.</p>

While lone-wolf attacks and domestic extremism remain concerns, the article argues that the intense, pervasive fear that defined the years after 9/11 has receded, reflecting a partial but meaningful victory in counterterrorism efforts.</p>

The report also highlighted that delaying retirement from age 65 to 70 can significantly reduce the chances of outliving one's savings.
