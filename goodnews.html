          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector, who initially considered selling it but was persuaded by his wife to find its owner. Using the engravings on the ring, he connected with a classmate of the original owner via a university Facebook group. The owner, now 77, called the ring's return a miracle, highlighting a story of integrity and human connection across decades and distances.</p>

          <p>Ahead of its 51st season, 'Saturday Night Live' is facing a significant cast shake-up, with several performers announcing their exits. Long-serving cast member Heidi Gardner is departing after eight seasons, joined by Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim, who also confirmed they will not be returning. The departures follow the show's milestone 50th season, after which creator Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for a change to reinvent the program. These exits signal a period of transition for the iconic sketch comedy show as it prepares to introduce a new cast dynamic for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Shares for the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged by 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that significantly exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on $876 million in revenue, representing a 33% year-over-year increase and a shift to profitability from a loss in the previous year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted strong consumer spending and growth in partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, which helped offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client. The company's optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year also contributed to the positive market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging final week, the U.S. stock market concluded August with solid gains, marking its fourth consecutive winning month with the S&P 500 advancing roughly 2%. The week's downturn, which broke a four-week winning streak, was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report. Inflation concerns also resurfaced as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the core PCE price index, showed a persistent annual rate of 2.9%. Investors are now looking ahead to the Fed's September meeting, where a rate cut is still widely anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it to be one of the most bizarre dinosaurs ever found. Discovered in Morocco and dating back 165 million years, the remains show that the herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate species. This unique and elaborate armor challenges previous theories that early ankylosaurs had simpler defenses that evolved over time. Researchers have dubbed the creature the "punk rocker" of its era due to its strange and formidable appearance.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won re-election in a landslide victory, four years after he says white officials locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. The election, the town's first since the 1960s, was held as part of a federal settlement after Black residents sued over the town's history of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors. Braxton's decisive win, with 66 votes to his opponent's 26, is seen as a major step toward fair representation in the majority-Black town and a restoration of democratic processes.</p>

The "Bigger & Weirder" tour fully embraces the elaborate costumes, props, and video screens that defined his famous shows, along with his classic parodies of hits from artists like Michael Jackson and Nirvana. Yankovic, 65, explains that he wanted to prove he was more than just "the parody guy" but is now enjoying ramping up the silliness again with an expanded band that allows for more complex musical arrangements.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months, setting up a high-stakes contest. The vacancy was created when the Democratic incumbent was elected to the U.S. House, leaving Democrats with a slim 19-18 majority. A Republican victory in the special election, scheduled for May 2026, would result in a tied 19-19 chamber. This could allow Republicans to block Governor Whitmer's legislative agenda in her final year, as she had faced criticism from both parties for the long delay in calling the election.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates remaining elevated, seniors looking to tap into their home equity without refinancing have several viable options. One key method, available only to homeowners aged 62 and older, is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Other alternatives include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. These financial tools allow seniors to access their accumulated wealth while preserving their existing low-rate primary mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of historic, multigenerational ranches in the American West are being listed for sale as heirs find themselves in disagreement or have little interest in continuing the family legacy. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory of these trophy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. These sprawling properties, some on the market for the first time in over a century, represent a major transfer of generational wealth as families choose to cash out rather than manage the complex and capital-intensive operations of a modern ranch.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in its attempt to end the humanitarian program. The court noted that the TPS statute, as written by Congress, is designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides a significant, though potentially temporary, reprieve for Venezuelans who fled their country's political and economic crisis.</p>
