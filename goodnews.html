          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order targeting birthright citizenship. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their children. U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante stated that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was not blocked and that the injunction is in the public interest. The decision represents a significant legal victory for opponents of the policy, though it includes a seven-day stay for a potential appeal.</p>

          <p>Varda Space Industries, a startup focused on manufacturing drugs in space, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the microgravity environment of orbit to crystallize medicines that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of its space missions and build out its pharmaceutical lab. Varda has already completed three launches and successfully created the drug Ritonavir in orbit, marking a significant step toward establishing an orbital economy based on in-space manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has enacted a new law requiring food companies and restaurants to disclose if their animal products were sourced from animals subjected to painful procedures without anesthesia. This includes common practices like the castration of piglets, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. The regulation, which also requires disclosure for foie gras production, aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase. While falling short of an import ban, the law treats products from these practices like a vice, potentially influencing consumer choices and producer practices.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Scientific Link Between Sunlight Exposure and Human Well-Being</h2>

          <p>Scientific research increasingly supports the idea that sunlight exposure positively affects happiness and well-being. Studies suggest that sunlight boosts mood by interacting with eye cells that regulate brain regions tied to emotion and by helping to synthesize vitamin D, which may have antidepressant effects. The article recommends incorporating short, regular morning sun exposure into daily routines to enhance wakefulness and sleep. However, it also cautions that relationships and other life factors remain more significant contributors to overall life satisfaction than climate alone.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Supermarkets Like Trader Joe's and Wegmans Inspire Fanatical Devotion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the growing cultural trend of intense consumer loyalty and fandom surrounding certain grocery store chains like Trader Joe's, H-E-B, and Wegmans. Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest this phenomenon stems from fandom becoming a primary means of identity signaling and community building, often replacing more traditional affiliations. These brands successfully create a sense of tribe by catering to specific regional, cultural, or lifestyle identities. Shopping at these stores has evolved beyond a utilitarian task into an expression of personal values and social connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have spread widely online. However, meteorologists and weather experts have confirmed that the small-scale weather modification operation conducted days earlier had no connection to the catastrophic event. Experts state that cloud seeding can only modestly enhance rainfall in existing clouds and is incapable of creating a storm of such magnitude. The deluge was caused by a convergence of storms and the remnants of a tropical system, a natural phenomenon in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley."</p>

          <p>A team of Texas archaeologists has discovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the founding ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. This marks the first time an identifiable ruler's tomb has been found at the site, which dates back to 900 B.C. The ruler, who took power in A.D. 331, was interred with 11 pottery vessels, a jadeite death mask, and other valuable relics. The discovery provides crucial new insights into the history of the Caracol dynasty and its early connections with other major Mesoamerican centers.</p>
