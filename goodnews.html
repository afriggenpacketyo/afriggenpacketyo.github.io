        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb cited due process concerns, stating that the government's current procedures are insufficient for a large group of people living in the nation's interior. Previously limited to areas near the border, the policy's expansion allowed immigration officials to deport certain migrants without a court hearing. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's immigration enforcement strategy, though it is expected to be appealed.</p>

Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required two medical time-outs, the 24-time Grand Slam champion secured a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory. This loss marks Norrie's seventh defeat against Djokovic and ends British singles participation in the tournament.

          <p>A 10-mile portion of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years. The scenic route suffered extensive damage from rock slides and pavement collapses during the severe winters of 2022 and 2023, followed by further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to restore access to popular hiking trails and may help alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads in the Angeles National Forest.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 21:10:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the broad tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal law, dealing a significant blow to his trade policies. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs, calling it a core congressional power. The ruling applies to baseline tariffs on most countries and higher "reciprocal" tariffs on others, though it will not take immediate effect to allow for a potential Supreme Court appeal. The Trump administration has vowed to fight the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts See Potential for Continued Rally in Chinese Stocks Amid Investor Interest</h2>

          <p>An ongoing rally in Chinese equities is attracting both domestic and overseas investors, suggesting potential for further growth in the combined US$20 trillion market. Investment managers note that as yields on fixed-income products fall to record lows, Chinese savers may rotate their US$22 trillion in savings into stocks. Global asset managers are turning more positive, citing "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI as a key driver. After years of underperformance, both mainland A-shares and Hong Kong-listed H-shares are seen as having significant room to catch up with other major global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges argued that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from electoral politics, and the statute does not permit the Homeland Security secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior extension. This decision safeguards, for now, the ability of these individuals to legally live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>A charity program is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors with toddlers from a local nursery. The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students. Participants like 13-year-old Siena have seen their school attendance more than double after engaging with the program. The scheme operates on the principle that giving a disengaged teenager responsibility for a younger child can positively impact their own engagement with education and learning.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September, sparking speculation about a potential reconciliation with his father, King Charles III. Unlike his last visit, the King will be in the UK, creating an opportunity for them to meet for the first time since the King's cancer diagnosis was announced. Recent signs, such as a meeting between their respective communications teams, suggest tensions may be easing. However, trust remains a significant hurdle, and both Buckingham Palace and Harry's team have remained silent on the possibility of a private meeting.</p>

          <p>China is streamlining its national laboratory system to better serve its strategic agenda in the global technology competition. The restructured program, which now includes around 500 approved labs nationwide, is shifting away from loosely defined research toward a more centralized model. This new approach emphasizes clear mandates, direct funding, and accountability to Beijing's goals for scientific supremacy. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by the Minister of Science and Technology, highlighted the expectation for these labs to directly support national development through targeted innovation.</p>
