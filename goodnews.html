          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 22:07:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes after the U.S. began requiring REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or other federally-approved IDs for domestic flights. The TSA emphasized that while they appreciate Costco's offerings, travelers must present REAL IDs, passports, or other approved documents like Defense Department-issued IDs to pass through security. The REAL ID requirement stems from a 2005 law based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, aiming to enhance security standards for identification. The clarification is important for travelers to avoid confusion and ensure smooth passage through airport security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could provide a temporary reprieve for Asian countries navigating the complexities of the US-China rivalry. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, may ease the pressure on these nations to prioritize trade with either power. However, some analysts caution that the detente might also complicate their strategic calculations. Lee Seong-hyon notes that while the call marks a "tentative step back from the brink," the relationship between the two powers remains fragile, highlighting the ongoing challenges for countries balancing relations with both superpowers. This situation underscores the delicate geopolitical landscape in Asia, where nations must carefully manage their economic and security interests.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's leading hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its strong connectivity to international capital and markets. Despite mainland China's exchanges boasting a combined value of US$10 trillion, companies are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for capital infusions. Yan Jun, chairman of AICT, cited Hong Kong's access to global markets as a key factor in his company's decision to list there. The trend reflects a broader preference among mainland companies seeking offshore capital, particularly as US-China tensions rise, making Hong Kong an attractive and stable launching pad for international expansion. This underscores Hong Kong's enduring significance in global finance.</p>

The race, temporarily held at Saratoga Race Course, will be 1 1/4 miles, deviating from its traditional 1 1/2 miles. Sovereignty, the Derby winner, aims to replicate Thunder Gulch's 1995 feat of winning both the Derby and Belmont, while Journalism seeks to continue his winning streak with jockey Umberto Rispoli.

Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, reported that "further progress" was made after talks with U.S. officials. Both countries aim to reach a mutually beneficial deal, with Japan advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Japan has proposed joint efforts in areas such as strengthening supply chains and expanding imports of U.S. farm products.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over soaring rice prices and an upcoming national election. Ishiba seeks to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system, aiming to boost rice production and counter opposition parties' proposals to cut the consumption tax. Despite officially ending the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments have continued with subsidies encouraging farmers to grow feed rice. Ishiba's consumer-focused approach includes releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply and potential market turmoil. This move reflects a broader effort to address economic issues and gain political support.</p>
