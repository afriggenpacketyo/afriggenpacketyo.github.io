          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced substantial flight delays on Monday due to a shortfall in air traffic control staffing, impacting both domestic and some Canadian flights. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an advisory, holding incoming flights by over an hour and 40 minutes. This incident follows recent radar and radio communication malfunctions at the airport, which is a major hub for United Airlines. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to slow flights at the airport to address the ongoing delays, while the Trump administration has pledged to install new fiber-optic cables to improve connectivity.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has spent over $21 million on flights to Guantanamo Bay as part of the Trump administration's migrant deportation efforts. This figure, reported to Congress, covers 46 flights between January and April, costing an average of $26,277 per flight hour. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the expenditure as a waste of military resources for political purposes. The administration has transferred both high-threat and low-risk detainees to Guantanamo, with a memo outlining broad rules for holding migrants at the facility, including non-criminal detainees.</p>

The order suggests potential regulatory actions or drug imports if drugmakers do not comply, and it calls for investigations into why European countries get lower prices. The pharmaceutical industry responded positively, as the order was less damaging than anticipated.

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and China has resulted in reduced tariffs and triggered a surge in the stock market. The U.S. agreed to temporarily slash tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China committed to reducing tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. The agreement establishes a mechanism for negotiations between senior officials from both sides. Despite the progress, key sticking points remain unresolved, such as U.S. access to critical materials largely controlled by China.</p>

          <p>Labour's new immigration plan aims to reduce net migration into the UK through a series of measures. The plan includes tightening work visa requirements, increasing the residency wait time for indefinite leave to remain, and scrapping the dedicated care visa. At the same time, eligibility for elite university graduates is being expanded. The government says it wants to significantly reduce net migration without setting an overall cap, opting for a more flexible approach.</p>
