          <p>Recent laws, including a significant tax and spending package, are enhancing Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts. These tax-advantaged savings plans allow people with disabilities to save money without losing eligibility for government benefits like Medicaid or Social Security. Starting in 2026, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act will raise the age of disability onset for eligibility from 26 to 46, expanding access to millions more Americans, including veterans. The changes also allow rollovers from 529 college savings plans and improve tax credits for low-income savers, providing greater financial security.</p>

The embryo was created via IVF in 1994 and donated by the original mother through a Christian embryo adoption agency. The new parents had struggled with infertility for seven years before choosing to adopt the embryo. This remarkable event surpasses the previous record set in 2022 and highlights significant advancements in reproductive technology.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County that destroyed thousands of buildings, survivors are increasingly using modular homes to rebuild their lives more quickly. The article highlights the story of one couple who lost their home in the Eaton Fire and chose a startup that builds accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in a factory. This approach offers a faster alternative to traditional construction, which can be mired in paperwork and delays. The use of prefabricated, modular housing represents an innovative solution to the urgent need for housing following natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Figma, a collaborative design software company, has priced its initial public offering at $33 per share, exceeding its initial forecast of $30 to $32. The IPO raised $1.2 billion and values the San Francisco-based company at $19.3 billion. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition, which resulted in a $1 billion termination fee paid to Figma. The successful pricing indicates a gradually reopening market for tech IPOs, following other strong debuts earlier in the year.</p>

This is the first conviction related to the infamous killing, which was filmed and disseminated online by the terrorist group.

          <p>The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits saw a modest increase last week, rising by 1,000 to a total of 218,000. This marks the first rise in seven weeks, though the overall number of applications, which serves as an indicator for layoffs, remains at historically low levels. The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, actually decreased by 3,500 to 221,000. These figures suggest that the labor market remains resilient and businesses are continuing to retain their employees despite broader economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of late July 2025, average interest rates for 30-year mortgages are around 6.79%, while 15-year loans are near 6.01%, with refinance rates slightly higher. While these rates are higher than in recent years, they remain a more affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. The article suggests that with the Federal Reserve potentially pausing rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize or decline. To secure the best rates, borrowers are advised to maintain a strong credit score, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, high-yield savings accounts are providing interest rates that outpace inflation, making them an effective tool for preserving and growing savings. While the national average savings rate is a low 0.38% APY, top online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%. These accounts are a secure option, typically insured up to $250,000, and offer a significant advantage over traditional savings accounts. To maximize returns, consumers are encouraged to compare offerings from different online banks, which often have lower overhead and can provide more competitive rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing a critical case challenging President Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The lawsuit, brought by several states and small businesses, argues the president overstepped his constitutional authority, as the power to set tariffs rests with Congress. A lower court had previously blocked the tariffs, but the appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending its review. The case tests novel legal arguments, including the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, which could limit executive power in economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement, reportedly costing DR Congo €44 million, aims to raise the country's international profile and promote tourism and investment. The deal includes training opportunities for young Congolese players and coaches, but has drawn criticism from some who question the government's spending priorities, given the underfunding of its own domestic football league and the ongoing conflict in the country's east.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, is investigating four companies that operate a total of 34 pornography websites for potential non-compliance with new age verification rules. These regulations, part of the Online Safety Act, mandate that sites with adult content must use effective tools to prevent children from accessing it. The investigation targets companies with a combined nine million monthly visitors and is part of a broader enforcement effort that has already targeted platforms like 4chan. The rules have prompted some public backlash and debate over their effectiveness, particularly regarding the use of VPNs to bypass them.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's own owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, would reduce risk and could be fully operational by 2035. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the controversial expansion project, which aims to significantly increase the airport's flight capacity.</p>

          <p>A late-stage clinical trial by Eli Lilly showed its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offers significant heart health benefits when compared directly to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke by 8% in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. While not statistically superior on this primary goal, Mounjaro also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and provided greater kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for this high-risk patient population.</p>

The massive bolt extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri. This record, along with another for the longest duration flash (17.1 seconds over South America), was identified using advanced space-based mapping technology from geostationary satellites. These findings underscore that lightning can travel extremely long distances from its parent thunderstorm, reinforcing safety advice to seek shelter immediately during lightning storms.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote in Taiwan targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. The campaign, led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had framed the issue as a battle to "resist China, protect Taiwan," accusing the lawmakers of undermining national security. Analysts suggest that the failure of the recall has temporarily eased tensions with Beijing, as a successful recall could have been interpreted by mainland China as a sign of rising anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance. However, the outcome still leaves a new layer of political uncertainty.</p>
