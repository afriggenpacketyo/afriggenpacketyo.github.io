          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping pace with the average monthly gain over the past year. The unemployment rate also saw a slight improvement, ticking down to 4.1%. Job growth was primarily driven by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, which added 73,000 positions, while healthcare also saw robust gains. This stronger-than-expected report suggests the job market remains on solid footing despite broader economic uncertainties, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts.

          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic secured a dominant second-round victory over British player Dan Evans, winning in straight sets 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. The 38-year-old Serbian delivered a masterful serving performance, preventing Evans from gaining any momentum in what could be the veteran's final appearance on Centre Court. Djokovic's win marks his 99th match victory at the All England Club as he continues his quest for a record-equaling eighth Wimbledon men's singles title. The victory demonstrated that he remains a top contender, executing his game plan with near-perfect precision against the home favorite.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has chosen not to take up a case involving a Montana law that would have required minors to obtain notarized parental consent for an abortion. By declining the appeal, the justices leave in place a Montana Supreme Court ruling that struck down the law on state constitutional grounds. The state had argued that the law upheld parents' constitutional rights to direct their children's care. In a separate note, Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch indicated that while this specific case was a "poor vehicle," they remain open to addressing the constitutional question of parental rights in a future case.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tripadvisor jumped 17% following the disclosure that activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake of over 9% in the online travel company. The position, valued at approximately $160 million, has fueled speculation about potential strategic changes at Tripadvisor, whose stock performance has been lackluster. Starboard Value is well-known for pushing for significant shifts in corporate strategy, including leadership changes and cost-cutting measures at companies where it takes a sizable position. This development comes after Tripadvisor announced last year that it was forming a special committee to explore its options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners facing rising insurance premiums may find relief by undertaking specific home renovations that reduce risk. According to insurance experts, projects like a full roof replacement with impact-resistant materials and upgrading old electrical and plumbing systems can lead to significant discounts. Insurers also favor the installation of monitored security systems and storm shutters in hurricane-prone areas, as these measures lower the likelihood of expensive claims. However, cosmetic upgrades such as kitchen remodels or adding a swimming pool typically do not lower costs and may even increase premiums by raising the home's replacement value.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-ever unmanned semi-submersible "narco sub" in the Caribbean, a vessel notably equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for remote operation. Although the drone submarine was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a trial run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest cocaine cartel. The vessel had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This seizure highlights a significant technological evolution in drug trafficking, as cartels migrate toward sophisticated unmanned systems that are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew members being captured.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid shifting economic conditions, seniors are encouraged to re-evaluate their life insurance policies to ensure they still meet their financial needs. Experts suggest asking critical questions, such as whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if beneficiaries are up to date. As financial obligations like mortgages or college tuition diminish, legacy planning, funeral costs, and charitable giving may become new priorities. Reviewing policies can prevent them from becoming misaligned with estate plans and can help families utilize life insurance as a tax-efficient tool for their long-term goals.</p>
