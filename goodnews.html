          <p>The total amount of assets managed by hedge funds globally has reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to new industry data. This historic growth was driven by a combination of strong investment returns and the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years. The surge is attributed to successful bets on the technology and AI boom, rising M&A activity, and expectations of lower interest rates. Industry leaders anticipate that institutions will continue to increase allocations to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance rates in the U.S. remain elevated compared to recent years, though they have stabilized, offering potential opportunities for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. As of late October, the average 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.34%, while a 15-year loan averages approximately 5.71%. The article suggests that strengthening one's credit profile is a key strategy for securing a better rate in the current environment. Experts note that if the Federal Reserve halts its rate hikes, mortgage rates are likely to stop rising as well, which would be welcome news for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of late October, the price of gold is approximately $4,131 per ounce, continuing its role as an attractive commodity for investors, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, historically holding its value over the long term. Its price is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical instability. The value of the U.S. dollar also plays a significant role, as a weaker dollar can make gold cheaper for foreign investors, thereby increasing demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed the discovery of the Jinlin crater in China's southern Guangdong province, marking the first identified impact structure in the region and only the fifth in the entire country. The research, published in the journal Matter and Radiation at Extremes, suggests the crater was formed by an asteroid impact approximately 10,000 years ago. The energy released by this event is estimated to be equivalent to the explosion of 600,000 tonnes of TNT. This discovery provides new geological insights into the history of southern China.</p>

          <p>Investment firms managing wealth for ultra-rich families are shifting to a more cautious strategy, according to a new survey by RBC Wealth Management. Family offices have lowered their expected portfolio returns for 2025 and are prioritizing liquidity, with 52% citing cash as the asset class likely to offer the best returns in the next year. This bearish outlook is driven by concerns over market turmoil from tariffs and the potential for further depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The move is seen as both a risk mitigation tactic and a way to build capital for opportunistic investments in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has effectively silenced recent debate about his two-way capabilities with a historic performance in the National League Championship Series. In a single game, he struck out 10 batters while also hitting three home runs, a feat that has reshaped the narrative surrounding his workload. This article argues that the dominant display serves as a powerful reminder of his unique talent and why he should continue as both a pitcher and a hitter. As he heads into the World Series, the focus has shifted from questioning his dual role to celebrating his unprecedented athletic achievements.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has secured a stunning victory in the Caerphilly by-election, a constituency held by the Labour Party for over a century. The result is a significant blow to Labour and suggests a major shift in the Welsh political landscape ahead of the 2026 Senedd election. Plaid Cymru successfully positioned itself as the primary vehicle for change, appealing to voters disaffected with both the UK and Welsh Labour governments. The outcome indicates Labour is in serious trouble in Wales, while Reform UK's strong second-place finish confirms its growing influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Philip Pullman's new trilogy, "The Book of Dust," a companion to his famed "His Dark Materials" series, delves into the theme of dangerous ideas by featuring books that promote a kind of post-truth relativism, causing characters to become estranged from their souls. This narrative reflects the real-world controversies that surrounded Pullman's original work, which was frequently targeted by religious groups and book-banning campaigns for its anti-dogma themes. The article analyzes how the new series engages with contemporary debates over censorship and the power of literature to shape, or endanger, a person's fundamental values.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption lawsuit against the country's main opposition party, the CHP, ruling that the case lacked merit. The lawsuit sought to annul the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition. The dismissal is seen as a significant victory for the party, potentially easing a year-long legal crackdown it has faced.</p>

At the Fort Worth Zoo, scientists are employing advanced assisted reproduction techniques, including hormone injections and ultrasounds, to breed the toads in captivity. These efforts are coupled with an innovative program that partners with private Texas landowners, who receive property tax incentives for restoring and maintaining the toad's native habitat. This combination of cutting-edge science and public-private partnership offers a hopeful model for the recovery of an endangered species.</p>

          <p>A Chinese geopolitical expert has suggested that China can learn from the United States' model of military-civil fusion to enhance its own defense capabilities. The researcher, Gu Jianyi, pointed to the success of U.S. firms like SpaceX and Palantir, which are defined by Silicon Valley-style innovation and agile development. He argued that China should remove institutional barriers to better integrate the technological prowess of its own civilian tech giants, such as Huawei and Tencent, into the country's defense industrial base, which could inject revolutionary momentum into its weapons development.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's potential election as New York City's first Muslim mayor is the culmination of two decades of political organizing within the city's Muslim community. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, young Muslim New Yorkers began building local political institutions to counter widespread suspicion and surveillance, gradually developing a formidable and progressive political force. This movement, born from a need for self-defense and representation, has steadily grown in influence, pushing the Democratic party to the left. Mamdani's success is presented not just as an individual achievement but as the expression of this long-term community empowerment.</p>

However, this article questions whether his phenomenal performance has translated into the anticipated transformative growth for the league within the United States. While his global appeal is undeniable, domestic MLS attendance has actually dipped year-over-year, and viewership growth figures are ambiguous. The narrative around his success is complicated, as his dominance is expected, leaving the league still searching for a way to convert his stardom into a sustained domestic fanbase.</p>
