Unlike their predecessors, this cohort, largely born in the 1960s-1980s, is technically trained, innovation-driven, and focused on co-creation alongside government and other partners. Many originate from provinces renowned for strong business cultures and effectively blend their experiences of past scarcity with current market opportunities.

          <p>A team of divers from 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC has discovered a trove of 18th-century Spanish treasure, estimated at $1 million, off Florida's aptly named "treasure coast." The remarkable find includes over 1,000 silver and gold coins, believed to have been minted in Spanish colonies and lost when a devastating hurricane wrecked a fleet of ships on July 31, 1715. The recovered coins, some still bearing visible dates and mint marks, offer valuable historical insights for researchers and collectors. This rare and extraordinary discovery provides a tangible link to the people and events of the Spanish Empire's golden age, exciting the world of underwater archaeology.</p>

          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her 10-month private battle with early-stage breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, aiming to inspire others. Her Stage One diagnosis was critically caught after she insisted doctors examine her right breast during a routine left-breast ultrasound, having found a lump herself. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation, keeping her diagnosis private for nine months. Now in remission and on a five-year medication plan, she hopes her story encourages others to prioritize self-exams and screenings.

          <p>This article delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, developed by enslaved Africans in Cuba as an act of resistance and remembrance. The practice emphasizes character, balance, and connection to divine orishas, reflecting a profound focus on health and well-being. Scholars are actively working to destigmatize Lucumí, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to its non-white, anti-white supremacy origins. The article clarifies practices like animal sacrifice, noting their communal and prayerful nature, and challenges stereotypes of "black magic," asserting Lucumí's core purpose is protection, healing, and alignment with destiny, offering tools for collective survival.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the widely used FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after unveiling a new pricing model for its credit score business. The company will now license FICO scores directly to mortgage resellers, enabling them to distribute scores directly to borrowers and potentially bypassing traditional credit bureaus. This strategic change aims to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and offer lenders more choice in pricing and distribution, with the goal of improving FICO's economics and fostering greater market competitiveness. Shares of major credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, declined significantly in response, as analysts foresee a potential disintermediation of their current role in credit score distribution.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Democrats are actively resisting the Trump administration's agenda through a combination of procedural powers in Congress and robust legal challenges, despite widespread voter perceptions of their weakness. In the legislative branch, they employ tools like filibusters, forced roll call votes, and extended speaking times to delay legislation and nominations. Outside Congress, Democratic lawsuits have proven effective, successfully blocking or delaying numerous administration moves. This "under-the-radar" resistance, however, often goes unnoticed by a frustrated base demanding more visible and inspiring opposition. The disconnect highlights the inherent limitations of minority party power and the ongoing challenge of balancing effective obstruction with public demand for decisive action.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has finalized a $6.6 billion secondary share sale, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at a staggering $500 billion valuation. This transaction, which saw approximately two-thirds of the authorized shares change hands, cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing even SpaceX. The deal follows a previous $1.5 billion sale and is seen internally as a strong vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects and continued investor appetite. This strategy allows OpenAI to retain top artificial intelligence talent by enabling employees to cash out without pursuing an immediate IPO, amidst intensifying competition in the rapidly evolving AI sector.

          <p>In a poignant BBC documentary filmed before his death, rock legend Ozzy Osbourne reflected on his life and "humbling" farewell concert, asserting he "wouldn't change a thing." The film, "Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," captures his final three years, including his determination to perform despite a serious spinal injury and Parkinson's disease. Osbourne expressed deep emotion during his final gig at Villa Park, struggling to sing his song "Mama, I'm Coming Home" and regretting having to perform seated. The documentary also reveals his desire to be buried in the UK and personal details, like his temporary "addiction" to Pink Lady apples, offering an intimate look at the iconic musician's later years.</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by subsidiary Endeavor Air, collided at low speed on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck Flight 5155, scheduled for Roanoke, while taxiing to its gate. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating potential miscommunication, as air traffic control had instructed one plane to hold. The collision caused damage to a wing and fuselage, resulting in one flight attendant sustaining a minor injury who was treated at the scene. Airport operations were not impacted, and passengers were rebooked, with the National Transportation Safety Board recovering flight recorders for analysis, emphasizing safety as a top priority.</p>

          <p>The Vatican's Swiss Guard, the world's smallest army tasked with protecting the Pope and the Holy See, has unveiled a new non-ceremonial, formal uniform designed for events outside the Vatican. Featuring a yellow and white striped belt and gold buttons, this refashioned uniform harks back to styles worn by the Guard up until the 1970s. Swiss Guard officials view this return as a strategic move to distinguish themselves more clearly as a military corps, rather than solely ceremonial guards. Visitors to the Vatican will still observe the iconic red, yellow, and blue Renaissance-style uniforms for duties within the Apostolic Palace. The change coincides with the swearing-in of more than two dozen new recruits, a ceremony postponed due to the recent election of Pope Leo XIV.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have reached a new distribution agreement, successfully averting a potential blackout that could have impacted millions of customers.

Universal movies and TV shows will also be available to YouTube consumers on-demand. This resolution, following tense negotiations, demonstrates both companies' motivation to avoid customer dissatisfaction. The agreement reflects an evolving media landscape, with YouTube TV backing off demands to fold Peacock content onto its platform at no extra cost, instead agreeing to offer it as a subscription through YouTube Primetime Channels.</p>
