          <p>A 74-year-old man, initially given less than a year to live due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has made a remarkable recovery after receiving a double-lung transplant. The dog trainer, who had no symptoms until a routine scan revealed the terminal disease, was initially hesitant about the procedure but eventually agreed. After a challenging wait and post-surgery complications, his lung capacity is now at 98%. He has returned to his life with family and is training a new therapy dog, which he has named Encore to celebrate his own second chance.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the PLA Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students for its undergraduate programs. The ten students were accepted after achieving top scores on their university entrance exams, marking a significant milestone for the institution and China's military. Founded in 1953, the academy has progressively expanded its educational offerings and is now breaking new ground by including women in its submarine training, reflecting a notable shift in the country's naval recruitment policies. One incoming student expressed a desire to dedicate herself to national defense.</p>

          <p>According to his great-granddaughter, the 1930s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time of his death but never lost his identity as a cowboy from Oklahoma. The article details his journey from trick-roping in a Wild West show to becoming a beloved movie star, author, and columnist with a massive following. Despite his fame and friendships with celebrities and presidents, he remained a 'common man' at heart, using his Hollywood income to fund his passions for travel and ranch life. His death in a 1935 plane crash was a moment of national mourning.</p>

          <p>A recent on-court joke by tennis superstar Venus Williams about needing to return to competition for health insurance has shed light on the intricate and often frustrating U.S. healthcare system. The article uses her situation to explain concepts like COBRA, which allows individuals to keep employer-sponsored plans after leaving a job but at a much higher personal cost. It also discusses how the Affordable Care Act has changed options for those with pre-existing conditions, illustrating the deeply intertwined relationship between employment and health coverage that affects millions of Americans, even world-famous athletes.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), which is known for its China-friendly stance. The result means the KMT and its allies will retain their majority bloc in the legislature, signaling continued political headwinds for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and President Lai Ching-te. The unprecedented recall effort was initiated by civic groups who accused the opposition of obstructing the government and favoring Beijing, but it failed to gain the necessary support from voters.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government initiative led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is intensifying the debate over ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and their link to chronic diseases. While many snacks and sodas are considered UPFs, the category also includes foods like tofu, some cereals, and nut milks, creating a challenge for developing a clear, universal definition for policymaking. Experts suggest that while research continues, the focus should be on minimizing certain UPFs rather than targeting the entire category, as some processed foods can still be part of a healthy diet.</p>

          <p>In a significant departure from traditional Republican free-market principles, the Trump administration is embracing state intervention by taking direct equity stakes in companies crucial to national security. This new approach includes the Pentagon purchasing a $400 million stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials and President Trump personally holding a "golden share" in U.S. Steel as part of its merger with Nippon Steel. This strategy is framed as a necessary measure to counter Chinese economic dominance and secure vital domestic supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have called for greater international cooperation between the U.S. and China to manage the risks of advanced AI. Hinton warned that without collaboration, AI could mature into a technology that humans can no longer control, emphasizing that no country wants that outcome. He drew a parallel to the U.S.-Soviet cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation during the Cold War as a model for addressing this critical shared threat, despite other divergent national interests.</p>

The article highlights the severe suffering involved, where infant monkeys are often poached by killing their mothers and then live lives of chronic stress and malnutrition in unsuitable human environments. Animal welfare groups and zoos are lobbying for the bill's passage to protect primates and slow down an industry fueled by romanticized depictions on social media.</p>
