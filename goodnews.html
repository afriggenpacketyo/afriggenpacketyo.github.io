          <p>President Trump stated that tariffs against China would increase substantially if a trade deal isn't reached. He made these remarks before embarking on a trip to the Middle East, emphasizing the importance of ongoing trade negotiations. The U.S. and China had previously announced an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, which seemed to be favored by U.S. markets, causing stock futures to climb. Trump's administration continues to push for peace between Russia and Ukraine, as well as in the Gaza Strip, during his international trip.</p>

          <p>President Trump dismissed ethical concerns regarding accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as a new Air Force One, stating that only someone "stupid" would refuse such an offer. He clarified that the gift would be to the U.S. Department of Defense, not him personally, and he wouldn't use it after leaving office, with plans to decommission it for his presidential library. Democrats and government watchdogs have raised concerns about potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits gifts from foreign governments to public office holders, especially given Trump's private company's projects in Qatar.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli hostage, after more than 19 months in captivity in Gaza. The release occurred as President Trump departed for a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Hamas stated that the release was unconditional, hoping to work towards a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and renewing vital humanitarian aid. Alexander, who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israeli military when abducted during the Hamas-orchestrated attack on October 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Most flights destined for Newark Liberty International Airport are experiencing significant delays due to a shortage in air traffic control staffing. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory delaying incoming flights from all U.S. airports and some in Canada. This delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar and radio communication malfunctions. The Transportation Secretary plans to slow flights at the airport to address the ongoing delays and the Trump administration has promised to install new fiber-optic cables connecting the airport and the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia.</p>

HISA found that Alvarado used the whip eight times, exceeding the permitted six strikes. This being his second offense, his fine was doubled to $62,000, and he received a two-day ban. Alvarado denies abusing the horse and believes the punishment is disproportionate, stating that he will weigh the benefits of an appeal against the desire to move past the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate these lower prices. The order suggests the administration might consider regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries if drugmakers don't comply. This is viewed as a win for the pharmaceutical industry, which had been anticipating a more damaging policy. The executive order also directs federal agencies to investigate why European countries obtain lower drug prices and to encourage them to pay more.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer cautions investors against chasing Monday's market rally, triggered by the U.S.-China deal to cut tariffs, because the trading is "so indiscriminate." He suggests that once selling pressure returns, even strong companies could be affected. Cramer typically advises selling stocks when the market seems overheated and buying when it looks unnecessarily weak. He views rallies as opportunities to raise cash rather than spend it. The market rallied after the U.S. and China made "substantial progress" in trade discussions, agreeing to temporarily cut tariffs, but the agreement only lasts for 90 days, requiring investors to closely monitor trade talks for a longer-term deal (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates meeting with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations, aiming for a more comprehensive agreement. This follows the announcement of a 90-day pause on most tariffs between the U.S. and China after meetings in Switzerland. Bessent noted that this pause establishes a "mechanism" to avoid upward tariff pressure. Under the agreement, both countries reduced their baseline tariff rate by 115 percentage points to 10%, with the 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remaining in place, bringing the total rate to 30% for most Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has called on cities and counties to ban homeless encampments ‚Äúwithout delay‚Äù as part of a crackdown on homelessness in the state. Newsom announced a new model ordinance to address ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù camps, along with $3.3 billion in funding for housing and drug treatment programs. The ordinance includes provisions to ban camping in one location, block sidewalks, and requires officials to offer shelter before clearing an encampment. This action follows a US supreme court ruling that cities can criminalize unhoused people for sleeping outside if shelter spaces are unavailable.</p>

          <p>Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark for 20 years, has died at the age of 89. James presided over a downtown resurgence in Newark but was later convicted of conspiring to sell city-owned properties to a former companion at a fraction of their value. Despite his contributions to the city's development, including new construction and the demolition of deteriorating public housing, James's legacy is tarnished by the corruption scandal that led to his imprisonment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices by forcing drug companies to match prices in other developed countries. If drugmakers don't comply voluntarily, the administration threatens to tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those paid in other countries. The order lays out multiple approaches to lowering prices, including directing action against foreign policies that lower drug prices and facilitating direct-to-consumer sales. However, the legal authority to enforce the order remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Labour's long-awaited immigration plans aim to cut levels of immigration into the UK. The government said measures in the white paper would make the system "controlled, selective and fair." The plan includes tightening work visa requirements for some by requiring a degree-level qualification, while loosening them for others by expanding eligibility for graduates of elite universities outside the UK. The plan also calls for longer residency waits before immigrants can apply for the right to stay indefinitely and the closure of a dedicated visa for social care workers.</p>
