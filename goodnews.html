          <p>France overcame a 13-0 halftime deficit to defeat Ireland 18-13 in a tense Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Exeter. Ireland dominated the first half, scoring two tries while two French players were sent to the sin bin, but failed to capitalize further despite immense pressure. In the second half, France staged a dramatic comeback with 18 unanswered points, including a crucial breakaway try by Joanna Grisez with 13 minutes remaining. The victory sends France to the semi-finals, while Ireland's quest for their first semi-final appearance since 2014 comes to an end, extending their winless streak against the French.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is offering a fresh perspective on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, often considered one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While the museum has long housed his most famous piece, "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the show explores his broader portfolio, which notably focused on male subjects in a way that was unusual for his time. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers" and a painting of a nude man bathing, were considered scandalous by the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition aims to reintegrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative and allow for modern interpretations of his unique artistry.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents are using food to heal their community after the destructive Eaton fire, forming the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with decreased sales. Founded by a resident who lost her home, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different eateries, providing a vital economic boost and fostering connections among neighbors united by shared tragedy. The initiative offers a space for residents, many of whom were displaced, to share experiences and find a sense of belonging. Mental health experts suggest this community-led effort serves as a valuable model for post-disaster recovery by bringing people together to rebuild social bonds.</p>

          <p>A new book by historian Jill Lepore, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," examines the nation's founding document not as a static relic but as a framework designed to be changed and debated. The article highlights that the founders anticipated constant revisions, with the Bill of Rights itself emerging from over 200 amendments proposed by the states during ratification. While the Constitution involved tragic compromises, particularly regarding slavery, it also included Article V, the amendment provision, empowering future generations to form a "more perfect union." Experts note that the founders intended for change to come from the people, not primarily from the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses an AI-generated voice to provide short audio summaries of products. The AI model scripts these descriptions by pulling information from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other web sources, aiming to simplify the shopping experience. While this could help shoppers quickly distill information from thousands of reviews, critics raise concerns about the potential loss of nuance and authenticity found in individual human comments. There is also a risk that the AI could unintentionally blend marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially misleading consumers by presenting promotional material as unbiased information.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that Europe's Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for the hostile crowd expected at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights, sounds, and abusive comments they might face from American fans. McIlroy stated he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want" to desensitize the team as much as possible before the event. This unusual preparation tactic underscores the team's detailed approach as they aim to secure their first Ryder Cup victory on American soil since 2012.</p>
