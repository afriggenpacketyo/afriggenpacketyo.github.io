          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18. This ruling by US District Judge Rudolph Contreras reinforces a 2021 court order requiring these individuals to be released to the least restrictive setting unless deemed a danger or flight risk. The Trump administration faces ongoing criticism for its immigration policies, including accusations of offering financial incentives for self-deportation and reviving family separation tactics.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), placing her on track to become the country's first female prime minister. A former heavy metal drummer and TV host, Takaichi is known for her conservative views, though she has recently softened her stance on social issues like childcare and women's health. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, she plans to revive his "Abenomics" economic vision and supports easing constitutional restrictions on Japan's Self-Defence Forces. Her victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain voter trust amid scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Israelis rallied in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism and gratitude towards President Trump for the potential Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas. Many protesters credited Trump for brokering a plan that could lead to the return of hostages, a goal they felt Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had failed to prioritize. The US-brokered 20-point plan includes a hostage-prisoner exchange, phased Israeli withdrawal, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. Critics accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the conflict for political gain, with some fearing he might still sabotage the agreement.</p>

          <p>Billionaire businessman Andrej Babis' populist ANO party secured a victory in the Czech parliamentary elections, winning just under 35% of the vote and 80 seats, though falling short of an overall majority. Babis, who previously served as prime minister, is now expected to initiate talks to form a new coalition government. His party aligns with right-wing eurosceptic groups like the anti-Green Deal Motorists for Themselves and the anti-immigrant Freedom and Direct Democracy party. Babis has ruled out referendums on EU or NATO membership, despite his party's skepticism towards EU emissions targets.</p>

The 23-year-old Belgian, signed for £18.1m, demonstrated agility with a low save and composure in a one-on-one situation, despite a couple of early mishaps. Coach Ruben Amorim explained the delay in his debut was for adaptation. This positive performance contributes to United's recent home winning streak and offers a hopeful sign for the team, though Amorim acknowledges the need for consistent away results.</p>
