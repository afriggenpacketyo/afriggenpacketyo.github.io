        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a significant jump of 4% after the United States and China agreed to slash tariffs, signaling a potential rebound in economic growth between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. The agreement involves reducing tariff rates by 115% for 90 days as both nations continue trade negotiations, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This development comes after oil prices had previously plummeted to a four-year low due to global tariff regimes and increased OPEC+ supply.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its immigration plans, aiming for a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by raising qualification standards to degree-level for most skilled workers, while simultaneously loosening visa eligibility for "high potential individuals" from select universities. The plan also doubles the residency period required for immigrants to apply for indefinite leave to remain, while scrapping care visas due to concerns about exploitation. Higher English language requirements will also be implemented for all work visas and adult dependents of visa-holders.</p>

          <p>As President Trump embarks on a Middle East tour, access to American-made artificial intelligence chips is expected to be a key point of negotiation with governments eager to invest in data centers. The Trump administration appears more willing than its predecessor to use AI chips as leverage to secure strategic bonds in the region, potentially playing into trade talks and other negotiations. Tech executives from companies like Nvidia and OpenAI are scheduled to travel to the Middle East, engaging with Saudi ministers and White House officials at an investment forum focused on AI partnerships. The US government began regulating AI chips systematically during the Biden administration, because of their value in helping governments develop military and surveillance technologies.</p>

          <p>China and the US have agreed to a 90-day pause to the trade war, with reciprocal tariffs to be lowered by 115 percentage points. The agreement applies to duties announced by Donald Trump on 2 April, which escalated to 125% on most Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures. The US trade representative said China‚Äôs retaliation had been disproportionate and amounted to an effective embargo on trade between the world‚Äôs two biggest economies. The fentanyl-related tariff will still apply.</p>
