          <p>Retirees are increasingly considering home equity products like HELOCs and reverse mortgages to manage rising costs, but each product suits different financial situations. HELOCs are better for temporary cash needs and one-time expenses, requiring repayment within a set period, while reverse mortgages offer a longer-term solution with no repayment until the borrower leaves the home. HELOCs are ideal for those who can manage monthly payments, whereas reverse mortgages suit retirees needing consistent cash flow without immediate repayment obligations (not investment advice). Retirees should carefully weigh their financial goals and understand the terms before choosing either option.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, while locking in high rates for a specified term. Online banks typically offer more competitive CD rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms of six months to one year, currently offer higher interest rates than longer-term options. Strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of both short-term and long-term savings goals (not investment advice).</p>
