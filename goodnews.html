          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, involving the release of all hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. This announcement follows intense negotiations and marks a potential turning point in the two-year conflict. Trump emphasized fair treatment for all parties involved and teased a possible visit to Israel to solidify the agreement. The preliminary agreement has been confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediator Qatar, with details expected to be announced soon, pending finalization of specific terms and mechanisms. This development could lead to a more comprehensive resolution of the conflict's underlying issues, including Hamas disarmament and Palestinian self-governance. The optimism score is 75.</p>
