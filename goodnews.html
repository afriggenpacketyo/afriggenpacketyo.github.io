          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:41:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump stated the agreement includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like vehicles and agricultural products. The deal, which comes after Japan's ruling coalition faced election setbacks, aims to create thousands of American jobs and was met with a positive surge in Japanese auto stocks. An additional agreement concerning liquified natural gas is also reportedly being finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal, shares of major Japanese automakers soared, with some seeing double-digit gains. The surge was fueled by reports that U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles would be lowered to 15% from the previous 25% rate. Major companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda all experienced significant jumps in their stock prices. This market reaction underscores the importance of auto exports to the Japanese economy, which constituted over 28% of all its shipments in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The England women's national football team has reached the Euro 2025 final after a series of dramatic, come-from-behind victories. Their journey was marked by overcoming significant challenges, including pre-tournament retirements of key players and an opening-game loss. The Lionesses demonstrated remarkable resilience, securing a 2-1 semi-final win against Italy with a stoppage-time equalizer and an extra-time goal. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised her team's incredible ability to stick together and turn around results, securing a spot in their third consecutive major tournament final.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially opened its first restaurant, a 24/7 retro-futuristic diner located in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The venue features supercharging stations for electric vehicles, two large movie screens, and a menu of American classics operated by industry veterans Bill Chait and Eric Greenspan. On its opening day, the diner attracted a large crowd of Tesla fans and curious locals, though it also drew a protestor opposing owner Elon Musk. The all-electric restaurant is part of Musk's vision to create entertainment hubs at charging locations, with plans to expand globally if the concept proves successful.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to the White House, the deals will see the Philippines become an open market with zero tariffs on U.S. goods. Similarly, Indonesia has agreed to eliminate tariff barriers on 99% of its trade with the U.S., opening its market to American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These agreements were finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline set by the administration for countries to reach trade deals or face higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a storied history. Originally a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, it participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The vessel was wrecked in a storm in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving. The identification was made possible through a combination of high-tech dendrochronology, archival research, and a significant community effort by the island's residents to recover and study the ship's timbers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House last week for a private conversation that lasted over an hour. The meeting signals a warming relationship between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term, largely due to Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. Recently, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve ties with the administration, particularly as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. The context of the meeting includes a recent and public falling-out between Trump and Musk.</p>
