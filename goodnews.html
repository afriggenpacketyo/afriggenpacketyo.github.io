          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic to the Golden State Warriors with a final score of 89-84. Despite building a double-digit lead in the first half, the Lakers' defense faltered in the third quarter, allowing the Warriors to take control. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while recent draft pick Dalton Knecht struggled with his shooting. Bronny James was present with the team but did not play in the game.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified the most stressful states for driving in the United States, with Texas ranking at the top, followed by New Jersey and California. The research analyzed 25 factors including commute times, traffic volume, insurance costs, and road conditions to create a "Stressful Driving Index." Southern states featured prominently in the top ten most stressful places. Conversely, South Dakota was found to be the least stressful state for drivers, followed by North Dakota and Alaska, highlighting significant regional disparities in driving experiences across the country.</p>

          <p>The first complete images have emerged of a large, mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft, often called an Ekranoplan. The aircraft, spotted on the Bohai Sea, appears to be jet-powered and features a v-tail and a modern, blended nose design. WIGs are designed to fly efficiently at high speeds just above the water's surface, making them useful for logistics, search and rescue, and potential military applications in littoral zones. While its exact purpose is unknown, this new craft could be a technology demonstrator, potentially informing larger designs similar to the Pentagon's "Liberty Lifter" program.</p>

          <p>Many young people in the UK are struggling to find summer or part-time jobs, often facing the classic dilemma of needing experience to get experience. Career experts advise that applicants can overcome this by highlighting skills learned through other activities, such as volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored, showing initiative by approaching small businesses in person, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While the job market for young people is more competitive than in past decades, these strategies can help first-time job seekers stand out to potential employers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA) is a polarizing savings product, designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus. While some users have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, many others criticize its strict rules, which have not been updated since 2017. Key complaints include a penalty for early withdrawal that erodes personal savings and a property value cap of £450,000, which is increasingly unrealistic in high-priced areas. Financial experts and a parliamentary committee are calling for reforms to address these flaws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's rugby team secured a convincing 35-12 victory over Argentina in their first Test match, thanks in large part to a stellar performance from George Ford on his 100th cap.

Ford expertly managed the game, kicking a crucial drop goal and several penalties to keep the Pumas at bay. Despite a brief comeback attempt from Argentina, England's clinical execution and strong defense ensured a comfortable win ahead of their second Test next week.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made his first public appearance since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, according to Iranian state media. He was shown on television attending a religious ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation about his whereabouts after he had only appeared in pre-recorded messages during the war. The conflict involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliation. Khamenei's appearance comes as the country observes the religious mourning period of Muharram, and was heavily featured in state media coverage.</p>
