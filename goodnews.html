          <p>The World Health Organization is preparing for significant budget cuts as the United States nears its official departure, initiated by President Trump due to accusations of COVID-19 mishandling. With the U.S. contributing around 18% of the WHO's funding, the agency is exploring ways to prioritize high-value activities such as vaccine guidelines and outbreak responses, while potentially scaling back training programs and offices in wealthier nations. China is expected to increase its financial contribution, and the WHO is also seeking support from pharmaceutical companies and philanthropic organizations to ensure key projects remain afloat amidst these financial adjustments. The organization is adapting to a new world order in global health governance, prompting a re-examination of its operations and priorities.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance rail travel in the United States. Europe is investing in night trains to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and government initiatives. In contrast, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting public infrastructure and rail systems. The article highlights the correlation between car dependence and decreased happiness, advocating for investment in rail networks and subway systems as a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative to cars and air travel.</p>

          <p>A bloody, bare footprint at a 1993 Minneapolis murder scene was the pivotal clue that eventually led to the killer of 35-year-old Jeanie Childs.

Decades later, DNA testing on items collected at the crime scene revealed an unknown DNA profile that kept repeating itself, eventually leading investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was convicted of the murder.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential runoff election after the previous vote was annulled due to irregularities in the leading campaign's financing and organization. The previous election saw far-right, pro-Russian political outsider Calin Georgescu surprisingly come out on top in the first round. Alleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of previously inactive social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of an "aggressive Russian hybrid attack," which Moscow denies. Romanian public prosecutors opened an investigation into Georgescu, who had been banned from standing again in May's rerun.</p>

The returnees were transported to a transit center where they will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration. They were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the state-sponsored 1994 genocide that left up to a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead. Most had returned when Tutsi-led Rwandan troops first invaded Congo in 1996.</p>

          <p>Kateryna, Ukraine's only female combat pilot, flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, highlighting the military's push for more women in service. While the number of women in the armed forces has increased, sexism remains an obstacle. Despite the challenges, Kateryna encourages other women to pursue aviation and has earned respect from fellow pilots. She flies as a co-pilot and navigator on Mi-8 helicopters, contributing to the defense of her country while navigating gender stereotypes.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fibre-optic gyroscope with improved stability across a wide temperature range, potentially enhancing navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The device offers a more stable method for measuring orientation and turning rates, crucial for inertial navigation systems that operate independently of external signals. This technology is particularly valuable for military and security applications due to its immunity to interference. The new gyroscope is also used in both military and civilian settings ranging from aerospace to weapons systems, oil platforms and autonomous vehicles.</p>
