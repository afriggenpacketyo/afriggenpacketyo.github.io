          <p>This article discusses the successful Hong Kong trading debut of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, with shares jumping over 16%. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the largest offering globally this year. CATL plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China. CATL has also faced scrutiny from the U.S. due to suspected links to China's military.</p>

China's President Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion line of credit, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions for several Latin American countries, presenting China as a reliable partner. This contrasts with Trump's tariff increases, foreign aid cuts, and immigration restrictions. The article suggests that China is now viewed by some countries as a defender of free trade and multilateralism, while the U.S. is perceived as practicing economic nationalism.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. This initiative aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts, as marine vegetation absorbs dissolved CO2 more effectively than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will commission studies on seaweed behavior and the environmental impact of carbon capture projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, reducing reliance on forests for carbon capture.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a revised law targeting male host clubs that coerce female customers into prostitution and other sex work to pay off debts. The law prohibits clubs from using tactics like denying contact with a host or threatening penalties to encourage customers to purchase drinks and food.

The law also strengthens punitive actions against managers and others running illicit host clubs.</p>
