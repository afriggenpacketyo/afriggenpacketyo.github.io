          <p>With one year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, organizers are addressing numerous logistical challenges, including transportation, security, and visa issues, as the tournament expands to 48 teams across the US, Mexico, and Canada. Larry Freedman, co-president of the Los Angeles World Cup Organizing Committee, acknowledged the complexity of managing the event, which anticipates over 6 million attendees and 6 billion viewers worldwide. Concerns include potential visa restrictions impacting international fans and the need for expedited processing, compounded by recent civil unrest in Southern California. Despite these challenges, organizers remain optimistic about the economic impact, estimated to exceed $40 billion across the host countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged Chinese exporters to focus on domestic sales using domestic letters of credit (L/Cs). These L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services, with payment periods generally set at one year. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by facilitating domestic trade.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment from the United States in ongoing tariff negotiations, especially concerning auto tariffs, after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at further increases on import levies on cars. Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, expressed confidence that Japan would receive preferential treatment once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump suggested raising tariffs to attract more investment in American manufacturing, which could negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to make progress in the talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump.</p>

He argues that cryptocurrencies move with equities and lack gold's hedging capabilities, making them incomparable. Reade emphasizes that digital assets do not pose a threat to gold's role in the market. (not investment advice)</p>
