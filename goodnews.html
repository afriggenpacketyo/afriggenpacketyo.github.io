          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a "crime-free zone" on Truth Social, attributing the achievement to his federal crackdown initiated two weeks prior. This operation involved declaring a public safety emergency, placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, and deploying hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents. According to preliminary data cited in the article, these efforts have resulted in a 40% drop in robberies and auto break-ins, alongside over 700 arrests and the seizure of 91 illegal firearms. The administration frames this as a significant success in restoring public order.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking it as the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no grand prize winner emerged from Saturday's drawing. While the top prize remains unclaimed, nine tickets across the U.S. successfully matched five white balls, with each winning over $1.1 million, including four in California. The next drawing offers the potential winner a choice between an annuity totaling $1.1 billion or a lump sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. This continues a streak without a jackpot winner since May 31. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Chinese entrepreneurs are increasingly choosing Southeast Asia over traditional Western destinations like the United States or Europe to pursue their academic and business aspirations. For example, Kent Cai, an entrepreneur from Zhejiang, relocated to Malaysia for a PhD, specifically noting the much greater chances of approaching venture capital there. This trend indicates a significant shift in economic opportunities and entrepreneurial focus among Chinese youth, suggesting a re-evaluation of global markets for personal and professional growth.

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first-ever lunar rover, scheduled for launch in 2029 as part of NASA's Artemis program. This 35kg vehicle will explore the Moon's south polar region, a challenging environment, to search for water and measure radiation levels, crucial data for future human missions. The initiative represents Canada's first lead in planetary exploration, building on its rich space history and overcoming significant engineering challenges like extreme temperatures and lunar dust.

          <p>Matcha's global popularity, driven by its superfood status and social media trends, has created a "matcha mania" resulting in unprecedented demand, supply shortages, and soaring prices, even in Japan. While this boom benefits Japanese tea producers and cafes, it also strains aging farming communities and the labor-intensive cultivation process. The Japanese government is considering subsidies to encourage tencha (matcha tea) cultivation, and major companies are expanding operations. Concerns persist about future harvests due to climate change and the need to educate consumers about different matcha grades. (not investment advice)</p>
