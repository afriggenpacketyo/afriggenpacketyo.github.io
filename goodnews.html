          <h2>Cardiologist Identifies Five Food Categories to Avoid for Children's Heart Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing on two decades of experience treating heart disease, a cardiologist has outlined five types of food he avoids giving his own children due to their long-term health risks. The list includes processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals and drinks, flavored yogurts with high added sugar, microwave popcorn containing certain chemicals, and deep-fried foods. The doctor explains that these items contribute to inflammation, high blood pressure, and cholesterol buildup, setting the stage for chronic illness in adulthood. He recommends healthier alternatives such as air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins like grilled chicken.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay for professional movers involves weighing cost against convenience, and financial experts suggest asking four key questions before making a choice. Homeowners should consider if they own valuable or hard-to-replace items that would benefit from professional handling and insurance. It's also important to calculate the value of time saved by outsourcing the labor, comparing it to one's own earning potential. Furthermore, the mental benefit of reducing stress and avoiding potential injury can be a significant factor, as can ensuring the expense does not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to high-interest debt.</p>

          <h2>Jeremy Corbyn Confirms Discussions for New Left-Wing UK Political Party Are Underway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:59:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that 'discussions are ongoing' for the formation of a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. This follows an announcement by former Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she is leaving the party to co-lead the new venture with Corbyn. While Corbyn expressed delight at Sultana's decision, he did not provide specific details about the party's leadership or structure, stating only that its 'democratic foundations' will soon take shape. The move reflects growing sentiment among some on the political left for an alternative to the two mainstream parties, though no other Labour MPs have yet committed to joining.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a collection of 'unusually large' 2,000-year-old shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Eight of the excavated shoes are over 30cm long, with one reaching nearly 13 inches, equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15. The finds are puzzling researchers, as such large sizes are rare at other Roman sites but appear to be common at Magna. The shoes were preserved in a low-oxygen defensive ditch, and archaeologists are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the fort to understand who might have worn them.</p>

          <p>The recent Summer Fancy Food Show in New York showcased several emerging food and beverage trends that may soon appear on grocery shelves and restaurant menus. Among the key trends were new, flavorful takes on pantry staples like olive oil and mustard, with brands introducing infusions and innovative textures. The 'swicy' (sweet and spicy) flavor profile continues to dominate, appearing in products from hot honey ketchup to cabbage-based relishes. Additionally, beef tallow is gaining traction as a cooking fat, and more restaurant chefs are launching their own packaged food brands to bring their signature flavors to home cooks.</p>

          <p>Apple is experiencing a period of contrasting fortunes, celebrating the blockbuster box office success of its movie 'F1' while facing scrutiny over its progress in artificial intelligence. The film's strong debut highlights Apple's successful long-term investment in its services and entertainment division. However, the company's recent AI announcements at its developer conference were met with a lukewarm response from Wall Street, which is concerned that Apple is falling behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. The delayed rollout of a more sophisticated Siri and reports that Apple may license AI technology from rivals suggest significant challenges in its internal AI development.</p>
