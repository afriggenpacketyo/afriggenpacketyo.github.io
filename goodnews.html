          <p>Google has agreed to a settlement of nearly $1.4 billion with the state of Texas over allegations of unlawfully tracking and collecting the private data of its residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company secretly tracked movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. A Google spokesperson stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have long been changed, and the company is pleased to put them behind them as they focus on building robust privacy controls into their services. This settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement Texas obtained from Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, has been released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled her continued detention unconstitutional. Ozturk had been detained since March, accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war, however, the government did not call any witnesses during the hearing. Judge William Sessions stated that her detention chills the speech of millions of non-citizens in the U.S., adding that the only evidence against her was the op-ed, with no evidence of violence or advocating violence. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, celebrated her release, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, which could result in new tariffs imposed under the Trade Expansion Act. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on various factors, including domestic demand, the role of foreign suppliers, and the influence of foreign governments. While the aerospace industry has maintained a trade surplus, it relies heavily on global suppliers, and tariffs could negatively affect the sector. Companies like RTX and GE Aerospace have already estimated significant costs from existing tariffs.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams' abandoned federal corruption case. Adams stated he discussed New York City priorities, including a wind farm project that was canceled by the Trump administration. Trump claimed Adams came to thank him, without elaborating. The released documents revealed that the FBI investigated Adams for potential witness tampering, though no charges were filed. The Justice Department had previously dismissed the case, citing the need for Adams' cooperation on immigration policy, a move that caused controversy and resignations within the department.</p>

Her lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel that she helped write in a student newspaper. The judge stated that the government's only evidence was the op-ed, and that noncitizens may avoid exercising their First Amendment rights for fear of detention.</p>

          <p>Omada Health, a virtual care company specializing in chronic conditions, has filed for an IPO, joining other digital health companies aiming to go public despite economic uncertainties. Omada offers virtual programs for patients with prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension, generating $169.8 million in revenue during 2024, a 38% increase from the previous year. The IPO market has been largely dormant for tech companies, but Omada hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for virtual chronic care solutions. Omada contracts with over 2,000 employers, supporting 679,000 members as of March 31, and sees significant market opportunity given that over 156 million Americans suffer from at least one chronic condition.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department.

While no data has been compromised, the incident has disrupted students' access to learning resources. The council has assured that students currently sitting exams will be given priority support, and an online help page has been set up to assist with password resets.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns that heat may damage crops in China‚Äôs agricultural heartlands. The wheat, of milling quality, is slated for delivery in July and August. This move comes after a risk warning was issued in Henan province, which grows about a third of China's wheat crop, due to hot, dry weather. China has been one of the world's biggest wheat importers, buying around 11 million tons worth $3.5 billion in 2024, but shipments slowed sharply after China reaped large wheat and corn harvests last year.</p>
