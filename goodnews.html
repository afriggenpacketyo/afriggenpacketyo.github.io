          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, may have set a new junior world record after catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass in Tomales Bay. The catch, which is significantly larger than the young angler, is currently being documented for verification by the International Game Fish Association. If certified, it would break the previous junior record of 59 pounds, which was set in 2002. The impressive feat has brought local fame to the eighth-grader, who was on a family fishing trip at the time of the remarkable catch.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction to halt operations at a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling prohibits the transfer of new detainees and any further construction at the site, citing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act. The judge agreed with a coalition of environmental groups and a Native American Tribe that the government failed to conduct necessary environmental reviews, posing a risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem. The Trump administration has been ordered to remove temporary structures from the site within 60 days.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still higher than economists' expectations. This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, fueling debate about the central bank's monetary policy. The slight cooling was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously surged. Despite the moderation, some analysts argue the Bank of Japan is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates to combat the persistent inflationary pressures affecting consumer purchasing power.

          <p>Financial markets are closely anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. Investors expect the address to provide signals about the central bank's future interest rate policy, with many anticipating hints of a rate cut in September. The speech comes amid significant political pressure on the Fed from the Trump administration to lower rates. Analysts will also be watching for Powell's assessment of the labor market and any discussion of the Fed's long-term policy framework, which is reviewed every five years and could see significant adjustments.

South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a slight dip, and markets in Australia and mainland China remained relatively flat. The cautious trading sentiment reflects global uncertainty ahead of the key economic address. In regional news, Japan reported that its core inflation rate for July cooled slightly but remained above the central bank's target, adding another layer to the economic picture.

          <p>The National Park Service has removed a large-scale illegal marijuana farm from a remote area of Sequoia National Park. The 13-acre operation involved nearly 2,400 plants and caused significant environmental damage, including diverting a creek and contaminating the soil with a highly toxic, banned insecticide. Law enforcement rangers had to airlift out approximately 2,000 pounds of trash and hazardous materials from the site. This bust is part of a two-decade-long effort to combat "well-organized drug-trafficking organizations" that use the park's vast wilderness for illicit cultivation, threatening wildlife and water sources.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the marketing of snack foods for babies under one year old and restricts the use of unsubstantiated health claims on packaging. Companies have been given 18 months to comply, after which the government may consider "additional or alternative measures." The move follows investigations that found many commercial baby food products, particularly pouches and snacks, were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients, despite being marketed as healthy options for infants.</p>

Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a slight earnings miss caused by one-time expenses, rather than a systemic issue.

The company discontinued the previous Cherokee model in 2023 as a cost-cutting measure. The relaunch of the popular nameplate is a key part of the strategy to regain market share in a competitive segment, as the automaker also navigates headwinds from U.S. tariffs.</p>
