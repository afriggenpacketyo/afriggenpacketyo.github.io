          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's call for his resignation. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described Trump's attack as "artless bullying" and a "vindictive political sideshow." He urged the Intel board to show "backbone" and stand by Tan, whom he praised for his past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to Chinese companies.</p>

Grant, who started the business in 1981, said this move preserves the company's family-oriented values, which would have been at risk in a conventional sale. The new structure will allow staff to receive a share of the profits and have a say in the company's governance. The decision has been praised by employees as a reflection of Grant's long-standing commitment to their welfare.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has indicated he is not yet ready to name a starting quarterback for the regular season, fueling further speculation. The intrigue follows an impressive preseason debut by rookie Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns. While veteran Joe Flacco is still considered the likely starter, Sanders' performance has intensified the competition. Stefanski stated he would have a clearer plan later in the week ahead of the next preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price approaching its all-time high, trading near $120,000. Ether also reached its highest level since 2021, briefly breaking the $4,000 resistance level before a slight pullback. This surge is attributed by some analysts to increased buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. The market's upward momentum has also boosted shares of related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy, signaling strong investor confidence in digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a significant surge that saw gold prices exceed $3,400 per ounce, the market has recently stabilized, prompting questions about its future trajectory. Experts suggest this is likely a temporary consolidation rather than the end of the rally, citing strong structural drivers like record-high central bank purchasing and its role as a hedge against geopolitical and economic instability. Analysts remain optimistic, with some projecting prices could surpass $3,500 by 2026. They note that gold's ability to diversify portfolios remains a key reason for investment.

          <h2>NYU Professor Argues Long-Term Success Hinges on Relationships, Ideas, and Execution</h2>

          <p>According to NYU professor Suzy Welch, long-term career success is primarily a function of three key elements, which she abbreviates as PIE: Personal relationships, Ideas, and Execution. The article suggests that building genuine friendships, rather than transactional networking, provides a stronger foundation for career advancement. Furthermore, having a few original, impactful ideas and, most importantly, the underrated ability to reliably execute tasks are critical drivers of success. Welch advises individuals to focus on their inherent strengths, such as being a strong implementer, rather than conforming to a universal definition of leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several presidential candidates in Malawi's upcoming election have nominated women as their running mates, a notable shift in the nation's male-dominated political landscape. This development aligns with civil society campaigns advocating for greater female representation in government. However, some analysts and citizens remain skeptical, questioning whether the move is a genuine commitment to gender inclusion or a strategic ploy to attract female voters. While seen as a positive step, experts note that true progress will depend on whether these women can secure influential roles and address the country's pressing economic and social issues.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace it, with top accounts offering rates over 4% APY. The article notes a significant disparity between national average rates and those offered by online banks, which typically provide more competitive yields due to lower overhead. Currently, due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about one year often have higher rates than long-term ones. Experts suggest savers consider online banks and laddering CDs to maximize returns on their cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unusual arrangement with the Trump administration, sharing 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. From an investor's perspective, the deal is seen as a net positive, as securing 85% of revenue is preferable to being completely shut out of the lucrative market. The move underscores the administration's transactional approach to trade and national security policy.</p>

          <p>As major travel credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve increase their annual fees and others like Capital One and American Express restrict perks such as free airport lounge guests, experts advise consumers to re-evaluate their value. Analysts suggest that while annual fees aren't inherently bad, it's becoming more difficult to maximize the benefits to justify the cost. For a travel card to be worthwhile, users should avoid carrying a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards earned. It is important to align the card's specific perks with one's actual travel habits and brand loyalties.</p>

          <p>The British government is planning a significant overhaul of driving laws, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses. The proposed road safety strategy also considers lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing license points for not wearing a seatbelt. These changes follow a coroner's report that called the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight.

After being left out of key squads, Grealish is seeking to rejuvenate his career and regain his spot on the England national team.
