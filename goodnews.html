          <p>Country music legend Ronnie McDowell revealed he suffered a stroke during a live performance in Pennsylvania this summer, telling his son he believed he was "having a stroke" while onstage. Doctors later confirmed the stroke, caused by a nearly 80% blocked artery, but credited his strong heart for his survival, allowing him to travel home for surgery. Despite complications from the procedure and anesthesia, McDowell is recovering and expresses profound gratitude for the outpouring of fan support. The 75-year-old singer, known for hits like "The King Is Gone," now holds a renewed appreciation for life after the health scare.</p>

          <p>American golfer Patrick Cantlay delivered a stellar back-nine performance, including four birdies in his last five holes, to shoot a 64 and tie Tommy Fleetwood for the lead at the Tour Championship. Fleetwood, who previously held a strong position, recovered from a double bogey with late birdies to maintain his share of the lead, setting up a compelling final day. Both players are at 16 under par, with a two-shot lead over Russell Henley. Cantlay's strong showing further solidifies his potential Ryder Cup captain's pick, while Fleetwood aims for his long-awaited first win on American soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, near the ancient Keeladi site. This effort aims to understand the ancestry and migration routes of the region's early inhabitants, supporting claims of an urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580BC, predating some northern narratives. The reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, sparking discussions on India's diverse heritage. This scientific endeavor offers profound insights into the country's complex past and human migration patterns.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich began the 2025-26 Bundesliga season with a resounding 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, featuring a Harry Kane hat-trick, signaling their continued dominance in German football. This lack of competition at the top has long been a criticism, hindering the league's broader appeal and commercial standing compared to other European leagues. In response, the DFL is pioneering a new strategy to attract younger global fans by granting live streaming rights for some matches to YouTube content creators. This bold move aims to redress the balance in foreign TV rights and win over a new generation of supporters who consume sports non-traditionally.</p>

The 23-year-old revealed he had been playing through the "quite painful" injury since the clay season, which progressively worsened during the grass season. After getting it checked, he took time out to heal, avoiding a more serious condition. Draper, who reached the New York semi-finals last year, emphasized his readiness to compete without holding back, having used mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows as "perfect" preparation.</p>

          <h2>US Retailers Adapt to Trump Tariffs with Mitigation Strategies and Selective Price Hikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 17:36:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major US retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are navigating the impact of President Donald Trump's increased tariffs by implementing creative mitigation strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some tariff costs have been absorbed or passed on selectively, companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and strategically raising prices on new or high-demand merchandise. Consumer spending remains steady but selective, with lower-income households more sensitive to price changes. Despite concerns, retailers expect the pinch from duties to be less severe than initially feared, though costs are projected to continue rising through the second half of the fiscal year.

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is significantly out-fundraising his rivals in the New York City mayoral contest, pulling in over $1 million between early July and mid-August. Mamdani, who holds a strong polling advantage, advocates for policies like rent freezes, free public transport, city-run grocery stores, and increased taxes on universities to fund city colleges. Despite his anti-billionaire stance, his campaign recently received a large donation from a hedge fund billionaire's daughter. His opponents, incumbent Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa, face increasing pressure to withdraw as Mamdani continues to dominate the race.</p>

          <p>Grand Canyon University, the largest Christian university in the US, announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) unanimously voted to drop its lawsuit against the institution, ending years of legal battles. The FTC, under the Biden administration, had accused GCU of deceptive advertising and illegal telemarketing, particularly regarding its nonprofit status and doctoral program costs. University President Brian Mueller hailed the decision as an end to "coordinated lawfare" and unjust targeting, citing previous victories against the Department of Education and IRS confirmation of their nonprofit designation. This outcome marks a significant legal win for the university.</p>
