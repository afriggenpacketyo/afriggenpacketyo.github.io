          <p>The last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in May has been apprehended in Atlanta following a brief standoff. The capture of Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer, was the result of a coordinated effort by multiple law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI. Authorities were led to his location by tips and arrested him in a crawl space he had created inside a home. The capture concludes a massive, months-long manhunt and brings a sense of relief to the community and victims' families.</p>

          <p>Google is implementing stricter rules for its "Work from Anywhere" policy, which was introduced during the pandemic. Under the new guidelines, employees using even a single day of the four-week annual allowance will have a full week deducted from their balance. This change does not affect the company's standard hybrid schedule but is part of a broader trend in the tech industry to increase in-office presence. The move reflects a continued shift away from the flexible work arrangements that became common during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners, tapping into home equity through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is currently a much more affordable borrowing option compared to using credit cards. Average interest rates for credit cards are hovering above 22%, while median HELOC rates are just under 8%, making credit cards nearly three times more expensive. The article also points out that HELOCs can offer tax benefits not available with credit cards, as the interest may be deductible if the funds are used for specific home improvement projects.

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting show that officials were strongly inclined to continue lowering interest rates, citing weakness in the labor market. While there was near-unanimous agreement on the need for easing, policymakers were split on whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be necessary by the end of the year. The summary reflects a shift in the balance of risks, with concerns about employment outweighing the threat of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Many advisors point out that equities have historically outperformed gold, as company earnings compound over time.
