          <p>The United States has resumed sending some categories of weapons to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. This decision follows a temporary pause in certain shipments that was implemented last week. The halt was reportedly initiated due to concerns within the U.S. military about its own stockpiles falling to critically low levels. The resumption of aid comes as Ukraine continues to defend against ongoing Russian aggression and seeks sustained military support from its international partners. The specific types of weapons included in the resumed shipments have not been detailed.</p>
