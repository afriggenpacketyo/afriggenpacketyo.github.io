In a message, the King praised the veterans' courage and sacrifice, acknowledging the suffering of prisoners of war, civilians, and the victims of the atomic bombings in Japan, while emphasizing the importance of their victory for liberty.</p>

Plum had previously pointed out that no members of Team Clark attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which drew backlash as Clark was seen wearing the protest t-shirt. Speaking on a podcast, Plum explained she was trying to lighten the mood in a serious moment and acknowledged she should have been more aware of the context surrounding the CBA negotiations.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler is stepping down as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor following a period of intense pressure from activist investors. Her resignation comes after the company's recent earnings report failed to inspire confidence, despite its stock price surging since June. Investors like Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois had been publicly calling for a leadership change to steer the company back toward growth. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader while the company searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

This move is part of a larger trend of corporations, including Tesla and Chevron, leaving California for states with more favorable tax and regulatory policies. The company plans to establish a new office complex and a new Playboy Club in Miami, marking a strategic return to South Florida where the brand previously had a significant presence.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to release federal funds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, aims to build a national network of high-speed EV chargers. While complying with the law, the Department of Transportation has streamlined the program by removing several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards. The move was met with mixed reactions, with some praising the efficiency but others criticizing the lengthy and disruptive delay.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings is experiencing a significant resurgence after a nearly three-year freeze caused by inflation and rising interest rates. Recent successful debuts by companies like Figma, Circle, and Bullish have signaled renewed investor appetite, potentially opening the way for a backlog of high-value startups to go public. Wall Street executives and venture capitalists are expressing optimism, citing strong market performance and a more favorable regulatory outlook. However, some analysts caution that the dramatic first-day stock pops may be unsustainable and reminiscent of previous market bubbles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, some technology analysts argue such an intervention is a matter of national security. The move would aim to revitalize the struggling American chipmaker and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung for critical semiconductor production. While government ownership of private companies is controversial, proponents believe it is necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in advanced technology, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence.

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by focusing on simplicity and customization. The base model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can upgrade with over 100 official accessories or third-party additions through an "open source" model. While the company initially advertised a sub-$20,000 price point with federal tax credits, the expiration of those credits may push the price closer to $28,000. This raises questions about its competitiveness against other budget-friendly trucks like the Ford Maverick.</p>

          <p>Activist hedge fund Starboard Value has increased its stake in Salesforce by 47%, sparking a rally in the company's stock and speculation of renewed investor pressure. Starboard was instrumental in a successful activist campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed Salesforce toward greater profitability, and its renewed interest suggests it may advocate for further changes. Analysts believe this could pressure management to refocus on core business growth and margin expansion, particularly as the stock has struggled recently amid concerns about its AI strategy and a potential acquisition.

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested in connection with demonstrations against the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as 'Cop City'. The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the arrest. This decision is seen as a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO indictments, for their activism. Marsicano's attorney argued the state was deliberately using the legal process as a form of punishment.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice clove may offer several health benefits beyond its use in cooking, according to various research. Studies suggest that eugenol, a compound in cloves, has antimicrobial properties that can improve gum health and may help lower blood sugar levels. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like magnesium and potassium, and they contain antioxidants that protect cells from damage. While generally safe in food quantities, concentrated clove oil and eugenol can be harmful if consumed in large amounts and should be used with caution.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Zach Cregger's new horror film "Weapons," praising it as a "rare horror masterpiece" that successfully resolves its central mystery without sacrificing its emotional weight. The movie follows a suburban community reeling after nearly an entire third-grade class mysteriously vanishes one night. The review highlights the film's powerful ending, where the villain is defeated, providing a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, it also notes that the film astutely reminds the audience that this victory does not erase the profound trauma and grief the characters have endured.</p>
