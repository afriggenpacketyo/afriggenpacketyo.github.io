          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a 'crime-free zone' on Truth Social, citing a significant drop in crime and a surge in arrests following his public safety emergency declaration. Over two weeks, Trump deployed National Guard troops and federal agents, including ICE personnel, to patrol the city. Preliminary data indicated a 40% reduction in robberies and auto break-ins, with over 700 arrests and 91 illegal firearms seized. This federal intervention represents a substantial increase in enforcement activity, with the administration touting its immediate impact on public safety in the capital.</p>

Kent Cai, an entrepreneur now pursuing a PhD in Malaysia, highlights greater access to venture capital in the region compared to China. This trend reflects a shift in global economic aspirations and a search for more favorable environments for innovation and investment among China's youth.

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover, a 35kg vehicle scheduled for launch in 2029 as part of NASA's Artemis program. This pioneering Canadian-led planetary exploration aims to find water, measure radiation levels, and demonstrate advanced technology on the Moon's south polar region. Surviving extreme temperatures (-200C to 100C) and the abrasive lunar regolith are major engineering challenges. The search for lunar water has significant implications for sustainable space exploration and potential rocket fuel production, opening doors for future human missions and establishing the Moon as a 'petrol station' for spacecraft.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion has begun, offering 30 hours of government-paid care per week for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hails it as a landmark moment for working families, parents face long waiting lists due to nursery staff shortages. The sector needs an estimated 35,000 more staff, and providers struggle with low funding rates, leading to increased 'consumable fees' for parents. This situation highlights a critical gap between policy goals and practical implementation, impacting families and childcare providers alike.</p>

          <p>A global surge in matcha popularity, fueled by its superfood reputation and post-pandemic tourism, is causing supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. Exports of Japanese green tea, primarily powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade, with 44% going to the U.S. Japanese farmers struggle to meet demand due to the labor-intensive nature of tencha production and an aging workforce. The government is considering subsidies to encourage more tencha cultivation, while retailers implement purchase limits. Record heatwaves also threaten future harvests, suggesting prices may climb even higher amidst the ongoing 'matcha mania.'</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, have independently developed new trigonometry proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem, a feat previously thought impossible for 2,000 years. Their groundbreaking work, which they presented at an American Mathematical Society conference, has garnered global attention and commendations. Despite their significant achievement, both students remain humble, not considering themselves 'math geniuses,' and plan to pursue careers outside of mathematics. Their success is attributed to the school's ethos of boundless possibilities for its young African American women.</p>
