Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine.

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is making a major comeback to the British High Street, with plans to open new standalone stores for the first time since its collapse in 2020. The relaunch was marked by the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square. After its parent company Arcadia went into administration, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos, but its physical presence was lost. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high, its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing in a challenging retail environment.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, seeking a "fresh start" for their family. Since 2022, they have resided at the smaller Adelaide Cottage, a period that has been challenging due to the Princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind unhappy memories and establish a long-term family home. The couple will fund the move and any renovations privately, continuing their focus on creating a private life for their three children, who are settled at a local school.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is addressing the affordable housing crisis by transforming old shipping containers into sustainable shelters for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" project uses four containers arranged in an 'X' shape to create five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be constructed in just one week and are topped with solar panels, provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to a growing problem. Stark is now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, continuing his mission to use existing materials to create dignified housing.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American rival Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who narrowly lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with this race setting the stage for another intense showdown.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man from Long Beach, California, was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area south of Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>Ge Changchun, a prominent academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology. This technology involves placing solar power stations in orbit to collect intense solar radiation, convert it into electricity, and transmit it back to Earth. Ge argues that a more robust, top-down national strategy is needed to close the technological gap with the United States and secure a leading position in the future of energy and space exploration. He notes that current efforts are fragmented and lack the capacity for such a large-scale, complex project.</p>
