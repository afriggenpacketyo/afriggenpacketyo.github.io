          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British artists have signed a letter urging the Prime Minister to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect their work from AI. The artists seek transparency from AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models, fearing that failing to do so would mean "giving away" their work to tech firms. The letter supports an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, which aims to allow licensing agreements between creators and companies. While the government acknowledges the need to balance creative industries and AI companies, some argue that restrictive copyright regimes could harm the UK economy.</p>

          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft remained adrift in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur this weekend, but the exact location remains unknown. Despite the spacecraft's protective heat shield, designed for the Venusian atmosphere, most of it is expected to burn up upon re-entry, posing a low risk of injury on the ground.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide mussel quarantine due to naturally occurring toxins, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which make the species potentially poisonous to humans. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis, while domoic acid poisoning has no reported human cases in California. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 20:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that left-handedness may be associated with a higher risk of certain neurological disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Researchers found that people with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed. The study also indicated a potential link between atypical handedness and linguistic symptoms like stuttering and dyslexia. Experts caution that correlation does not imply causation and that being left-handed does not mean someone will develop these disorders. The study may help experts understand brain organization and development, potentially improving neurorehabilitation for patients with brain conditions.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, aside from an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions on Palestinian issues. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was targeted for her views, and the judge noted her commitment to her academic career and compassionate character.</p>

The judge lambasted the government's case against her, stating that her detention chilled the speech of millions of non-citizens. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, hailed the ruling as upholding the First Amendment principle that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>
