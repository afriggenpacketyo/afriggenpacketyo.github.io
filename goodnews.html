          <p>A family from Oklahoma unearthed a rare 2.79-carat chocolate brown diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas during a birthday trip. Raynae Madison initially thought the stone was too large to be a diamond but park staff confirmed its authenticity, noting its unique inclusions from plastic deformation. Named the William Diamond after her nephew, this marks the third-largest diamond found at the park this year. The park, a volcanic crater, has yielded over 75,000 diamonds since 1906, attracting over 100,000 visitors annually.</p>

Despite missing a penalty in a recent Europa League win, manager Unai Emery publicly backed Watkins, emphasizing his work rate and contribution to the team. Emery stated that the goals will come, highlighting Watkins' efforts in pressing and duels. The 29-year-old's struggles began last season, and he has missed all five big chances this season, averaging less than one shot on target per game.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under new American ownership, averting a ban. The order declares the deal a "qualified divestiture" under a congressional law, extending the enforcement pause to allow finalization. Under the agreement, Oracle will secure U.S. user data and review the app's code, while ByteDance will hold less than 20% of the new U.S.-based joint venture. This aims to address national security concerns regarding Chinese government access to data and influence operations.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, policymakers are expected to focus on solidifying the nation's manufacturing ecosystem and addressing weak links in its supply chains. Despite Apple's "made-in-India" iPhone claims, many core components still originate from China's unparalleled supply chain. Analysts anticipate the plan will aim to move China further up the value chain and resolve hi-tech chokepoints, enhancing its resilience amidst global economic transformation and external uncertainties. This strategy reflects China's national pride in its robust manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed a deal to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to American investors, claiming Chinese President Xi Jinping's approval. The executive order allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new $14 billion entity, with ByteDance owning less than 20%. Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell are named as potential investors. The new American TikTok will use an algorithm retrained on U.S. user data, with "trusted security partners" monitoring software and data flows. This aims to address national security concerns about Chinese government access to data and influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump formally approved a deal for a consortium of mostly U.S. investors to acquire the short video app TikTok, signing an executive order that green-lights the spinoff. This move aims to prevent a U.S. ban on the app by ensuring it meets "qualified divestiture" standards, proving it is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary. Under the deal, ByteDance will own less than 20% of the new entity, which will be governed by a board focused on protecting American users' privacy and national security concerns. The president credited TikTok with boosting his youth vote in 2024.</p>
