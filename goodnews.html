          <p>A manuscript purchased by Harvard Law School in 1946 for $27.50, once considered an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, has been authenticated as a genuine original from 1300, during the reign of King Edward I. Two medieval history professors, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, identified the document as extraordinarily rare and potentially worth millions. The professors believe the document originated from Appleby, Cumbria, and traced its provenance through the Lowther family to abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. The document's text, handwriting, and dimensions align with other known originals from 1300.</p>

The academics confirmed the manuscript's authenticity by comparing it with six other known originals, finding matching text, dimensions, and handwriting.
