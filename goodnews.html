        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) has announced it will disband after 41 years of armed conflict with Turkey, a move greeted with cautious optimism by Turkish government and opposition parties. Experts believe this could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, particularly for the pro-Kurdish DEM party, and require constitutional reforms. Key uncertainties remain, including the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge in its place. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized that disarmament alone is insufficient, requiring the elimination of illegal structures and the development of an accountable organizational model. The article highlights the complexities and potential ramifications of this development for Turkey and neighboring countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has enacted stricter immigration laws, drawing parallels to the policies of the Trump administration. The new decree increases requirements for citizenship, mandates proof of income for residency, and facilitates the deportation of migrants who commit crimes or enter the country illegally. Additionally, foreigners will now be charged for public healthcare and education, requiring all travelers to have health insurance. Critics argue that these measures challenge Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants, while the government asserts they are necessary to ensure the sustainability of public services and honor Argentina's history to 'make Argentina great again'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects economic growth to moderate in the coming years, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to have a significant impact. This is because Danish drugmakers rely on a 'merchanting and processing' system, where most of the value is in intellectual property, with manufacturing outsourced to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are limited, though heightened trade tensions pose risks.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog unveiled draft guidelines for a law governing smartphone software services of Google and Apple, aiming to promote competition from smaller firms. The law prohibits these companies from excluding competitors from their app stores and using data from their app stores for their own products. It also prevents unfair treatment of software suppliers transitioning apps between stores. The commission hopes this will benefit consumers through reduced prices and improved app access.</p>
