          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years in prison. The judge's decision followed emotional testimony from family members who believe the brothers have been rehabilitated and have served enough time. The resentencing was based on their age at the time of the crime and their demonstrated rehabilitation efforts in prison, including starting programs to help other inmates. The parole board will now determine their potential release, considering their risk assessment and conduct in prison.</p>

          <p>Following tariff reductions that suggest a de-escalation of trade tensions between China and the United States, Goldman Sachs and UBS have revised their economic growth forecasts for China. Goldman Sachs increased its forecast for China's real GDP growth this year to 4.6 percent, up from 4 percent, while UBS raised its forecast to between 3.7 percent and 4 percent. These revisions reflect expectations of a smaller shock on China's exports and economic growth due to the trade war de-escalation.

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden's aides covered up his "physical deterioration" during his re-election campaign, with claims that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. A Biden spokesperson refuted the book's claims, stating that "evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity" and maintaining that Biden had been "a very effective president." The book, "Original Sin," cites anonymous sources who claim that Biden's condition was so poor that aides sought to ensure he walked shorter distances and used handrails.</p>
