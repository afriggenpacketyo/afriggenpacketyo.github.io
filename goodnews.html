          <p>Epic Games announced that "Fortnite" will be unavailable on Apple devices because Apple blocked a recent app update, reigniting a dispute over App Store commissions. This follows a judge's ruling that limited Apple's ability to collect commissions on purchases made through external links within apps. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney stated that "Fortnite" would return to the App Store if Apple extended the court's "friction free, Apple tax-free framework" globally. Apple has requested that Epic Games resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting "Fortnite" in other regions.</p>
