          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met in Ottawa, signaling a possible attempt to mend relations after nearly two years of dispute. The dispute stemmed from New Delhi's alleged involvement in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh separatist. Modi expressed hope for renewed cooperation with Ottawa during the meeting with Carney. This meeting marks a significant step towards resolving the strained relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill includes provisions for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, granting authority to the Treasury Secretary. Critics argue the bill favors President Trump's crypto ventures, while supporters say it protects consumers and promotes innovation. The legislation now moves to the House, where it faces potential reconciliation with a similar bill. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers are using ranked-choice voting in the city's mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. This system has led to unusual alliances among candidates, with some cross-endorsing each other. The full results of the primary will not be reported until a week after the election due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to announce an update to its Graviton4 chip, including increased network bandwidth, demonstrating the success of its custom chip strategy. The Graviton4 chip, a central processing unit (CPU), is one of many chip products from Amazon's Annapurna Labs. AWS is looking to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive graphics processing units (GPUs). Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, and Project Rainier is powered by over half a million of the chips, which would have traditionally gone to Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Tinder has launched a double-dating feature called Double Date, allowing users to create joint profiles with friends to match with other pairs, as the app struggles to retain Gen Z users. The feature is a refined version of the failed Tinder Social and is meant to relieve dating stress for younger users. Tinder is facing mounting pressure on its business, reporting a decline in paying subscribers and recent layoffs. This new feature reflects broader trends in the dating app industry, with Gen Z increasingly preferring meeting potential partners through mutual friends and real-world gatherings.</p>
