        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of nearly $112,000, driven by increased institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. This rise occurs despite a recent drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, including advancing crypto legislation and Coinbase joining the S&P 500, have further supported the market. Even notable bitcoin skeptic Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase has indicated the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics indicates that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, nearly a thousand more Americans would have died from fentanyl overdoses. Despite fentanyl's addictive nature, the study found that users responded to price changes, with a 1% price increase associated with a decrease in the monthly growth rate of fentanyl-related overdose deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that breakfast cereals marketed toward children aged 5 to 12 have been getting less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. Researchers found that total fat and sugar content increased, while protein and dietary fiber decreased in these cereals. This trend raises concerns about children's nutritional intake and the impact on their energy and concentration throughout the day. The study emphasizes the need for food industry stakeholders to create healthier cereal options for children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax bill passed by the House includes a provision that would raise the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, potentially benefiting homeowners with high property taxes. The full $40,000 deduction would be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for higher earners. While proponents argue it eases the tax burden for middle-class families, critics contend that it primarily benefits high-income homeowners and could increase the national debt.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are often presented as a secure way to ensure a steady income stream throughout retirement, but whether an annuity can run out of money depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide income for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years. Variable and indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, and their value can be depleted if the underlying investments perform poorly. Careful planning and understanding the terms of an annuity are crucial to prevent the risk of outliving the income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggests allowing injury replacements in the first innings, subject to approval by an independent doctor. While many agree in principle, the challenges lie in ensuring the legitimacy of injuries and preventing abuse of the system. Former Zimbabwe seamer Henry Olonga proposes allowing substitutes for tactical reasons, not just injuries, to grow the game globally.</p>
