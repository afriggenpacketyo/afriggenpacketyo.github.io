          <p>Ford's redesigned, three-row Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up 53.7% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth in a large, gasoline-powered vehicle stands out as many consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expires. The strong demand for the Expedition, a key profit driver for Ford, indicates a persistent market for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. This trend aligns with Ford's strategy of prioritizing hybrid models alongside its EV development, positioning it differently from competitors.</p>

Thousands of gamers reported being unable to purchase the sequel shortly after its launch, with outage reports peaking significantly. Despite the technical difficulties, the game's popularity was evident as Steam recorded over 100,000 concurrent players within 30 minutes of its release. The incident frustrated many fans, who criticized the lack of a pre-order option that could have mitigated the server overload.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the historical and cultural significance of conjure, a spiritual tradition created by enslaved people in the United States. The book argues that this practice, rooted in West and Central African religions, has deeply influenced American culture, from culinary traditions to the development of blues music. Stewart traces how Black women, as the primary practitioners of this domestic art, shaped American approaches to medicine, childbirth, and community care. The article highlights how conjure's legacy persists in modern pop culture and represents a form of spiritual resilience.</p>

          <p>Following a rating downgrade for Texas Roadhouse by Evercore ISI, CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the potential impact on the restaurant chain's stock. The downgrade was prompted by concerns that rising beef prices could negatively affect the company's profits in the upcoming year. Cramer expressed his view that the restaurant should avoid raising menu prices to offset these costs, suggesting that if commodity prices fall, the company could see significant financial gains. He also identified a specific price point below which he would consider buying the stock for his charitable trust's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, down from 6.56% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac. This marks the lowest level for this key borrowing rate since October of the prior year, a trend that could increase purchasing power for prospective homebuyers. The decline is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions heavily influence the bond markets.</p>
