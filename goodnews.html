          <p>In a recent interview, Retired General Stanley McChrystal discussed his new book, "On Character: Choices That Define a Life," emphasizing the importance of character at the individual level and its impact on national leadership. McChrystal argues that the erosion of trust in institutions is a symptom of a broader societal issue, urging Americans to prioritize character and demand it from their leaders. He highlights the normalization of unacceptable behavior and advocates for a national conversation on character starting at the grassroots level, suggesting it is the key to restoring America's moral standing and global influence. He also touched on the military, suggesting that DEI initiatives are a distraction from the mission. </p>
