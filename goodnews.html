          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, extending a pause initiated in May, as policymakers continue to flag household debt as a key risk. This decision aligns with economist expectations and follows the implementation of stricter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. While the central bank noted stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook, it acknowledged increased uncertainties from ongoing trade talks with the U.S. and potential impacts of U.S. tariffs. Bank of America analysts have penciled in a rate cut by November, contingent on trade progress and housing policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Chinese official policy adviser has urged the nation to break free from Western 'discourse traps' when discussing issues such as state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. Speaking at Fudan University, the adviser emphasized that while China should confidently defend its party's rule and achievements, directly fighting back against Western provocations is unlikely to convince Western societies. He warned that such an approach risks a backlash among countries in the Global South. This article highlights the need for a more strategic and nuanced communication strategy to challenge perceived 'double standards' about China's rise.</p>

          <h2>New Clinical Trial Shows Promise in Preventing Breast Cancer Recurrence by Targeting Dormant Cells</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making significant strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by identifying and targeting dormant 'sleeper cells' that can later spread cancer. A clinical trial involving 51 women, published in Nature Medicine, showed that after seven years, only two participants experienced cancer recurrence, a rate far below expectations. This innovative approach offers renewed hope for patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who battled aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. The next steps involve larger trials to confirm these findings and explore applicability to other cancers, marking a potential breakthrough in treatment.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. A relative alerted authorities when they didn't return as expected, initiating a search throughout the night. The son's ability to use the boat's marine radio, which washed ashore, allowed them to make a mayday call, leading to their rescue by a Coast Guard helicopter from Naushon Island. The article notes they were flown to a hospital, with one family member in critical condition.</p>

          <p>Starting next year, NHS health checks in England, offered to adults aged 40-74 every five years, will officially include questions about menopause and its possible symptoms. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT), thereby bringing menopause into mainstream health discussions. While welcomed by campaigners and health professionals as a step to reduce stigma and improve support, concerns remain about the low uptake of general health checks, particularly in marginalized communities. The article highlights that staff carrying out the checks will need training for the change to have maximum positive impact.</p>

          <p>Helen Ledwick, a former BBC journalist, is advocating for greater awareness of pelvic organ prolapse, a common condition affecting many women after childbirth but often shrouded in 'shame and stigma.' After experiencing the condition herself a decade ago, she found a lack of information and support, leading to feelings of isolation and embarrassment. Ledwick has since launched a podcast and written a book to create a platform for women to share their stories and break the silence. This article emphasizes that while not life-threatening, prolapse significantly impacts daily life and mental well-being, urging better understanding and support.</p>
