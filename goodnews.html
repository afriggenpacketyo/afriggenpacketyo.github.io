          <p>The second series of "With Love, Meghan" has launched on Netflix, providing an aspirational and upbeat portrayal of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex's, life in Montecito, filmed near her home. The article highlights her sharing cooking, gardening, and hosting tips with celebrity friends, alongside personal revelations like her daily hot breakfasts for her family and Prince Harry being the first to say "I love you" during their early relationship. While the Duke and their children do not appear on camera, the series deliberately omits any discussion of the Royal Family or past royal life, instead revealing Meghan's surprising fondness for Magic Radio from the UK.</p>

          <p>China is accelerating the expansion of its national carbon market, with plans to incorporate major industrial sectors by 2027, significantly ahead of its original schedule. This initiative, guided by top policymakers, will introduce tougher absolute limits on emissions, moving beyond the current carbon intensity-based caps. The strategic expansion aims to revitalize the carbon market and demonstrates China's strengthened commitment to achieving its climate goals, as it remains the world's largest carbon polluter. Steel, aluminum, and cement industries are slated for inclusion this year, though with initially less stringent regulations, signaling a more aggressive emissions pathway for the nation.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is facing a career-defining decision regarding whether to include himself as one of his six wildcard picks for the upcoming tournament. With no playing captain since 1963, Bradley, currently ranked 11th globally and 8th among Americans, is deeply conflicted, acknowledging the immense pressure and the dual responsibilities involved. His recent strong performance at the Tour Championship complicates the choice, as some teammates and fans advocate for his inclusion, while critics question the feasibility of combining captaincy with playing. The European team, in contrast, appears to have a much more settled selection process.</p>

Now a superyacht captain, Ortega, who also appeared on "Below Deck," highlights that no prior boating experience is necessary, but a willingness to learn and a customer service-oriented personality are crucial. Entry-level crew can earn $3,000-$4,500 monthly, plus significant tips, potentially doubling or tripling income in summer. Ortega, earning $10,000 monthly plus tips, advises against joining solely for money, acknowledging the long hours and time away from family, but encourages those feeling stuck to pursue new paths.</p>

While some experts doubt the aggressive timeline, SpaceX's history of rapid iteration gives many fans optimism about its long-term success.</p>

          <h2>Morgan Stanley and Others Forecast September Fed Rate Cut Following Powell's Remarks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 01:57:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morgan Stanley has aligned with several other prominent global brokerages, including Barclays and Deutsche Bank, in forecasting a September interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This updated prediction stems from Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium, where his increased focus on labor market risks signaled a potential willingness for the Fed to act preemptively. Morgan Stanley now projects two 25-basis-point cuts this year, occurring in September and December, departing from its earlier stance of no cuts until March 2026. This reflects a perceived change in the Fed's policy approach, despite ongoing political pressure from the Trump administration to lower rates more aggressively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a notable policy shift, declaring that the U.S. will permit 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, which would more than double the current enrollment figures. This statement follows recent advisories from the Chinese embassy cautioning students about alleged "unjustifiably questioned and harassed" experiences at U.S. customs, particularly at Houston's airport. Trump's remarks signal a desire for improved relations with China, asserting his administration will "get along good" and mentioning a standing invitation from President Xi to visit, indicating a potential de-escalation in a previously tense area of bilateral relations.</p>

The two leaders found common ground regarding North Korea, with Trump expressing a desire for future meetings with Kim. While contentious trade and defense issues were largely avoided in public remarks, the meeting ensured Lee departed on positive terms, effectively averting a potentially contentious encounter.</p>

Scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou reported that the genetically modified pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained functionality for 216 hours (nine days) without signs of hyperacute rejection or uncontrolled infection. This breakthrough represents a significant step forward in xenotransplantation, especially for lungs, which pose distinct anatomical and physiological challenges. The study underscores progress in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, offering a potential long-term solution to the critical global organ shortage.</p>

          <p>A district court judge has declared Utah's current congressional map unlawful, ordering the Republican-controlled legislature to redraw the state's boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections. The 2021 map was found to be in violation of voters' rights because it strategically divided Salt Lake County, a significant Democratic stronghold, among all four congressional districts, leading to wide Republican victories. The ruling highlighted that the legislature circumvented a commission established by voters to ensure non-partisan redistricting. Although new maps are required swiftly, Republican lawmakers have indicated they will appeal, potentially delaying the implementation of new boundaries until 2028 and creating political uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House.</p>

These specific devices are now exclusively permitted in carry-on bags, provided a safety cover is securely fitted over their heating element. The regulation aims to mitigate the risk of these batteries overheating or combusting in the aircraft's cargo area, where such incidents would be challenging to address. Traditional plug-in hairstyling tools remain exempt from these restrictions. This safety measure is underscored by the Federal Aviation Administration's record of 644 verified incidents involving lithium batteries causing smoke, fire, or extreme heat on flights since 2006.</p>
