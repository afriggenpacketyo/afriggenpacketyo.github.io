          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, a fervent University of Michigan supporter, made his debut on Fox's 'Big Noon Kickoff' ahead of a major game between Ohio State and Texas. Portnoy humorously leaned into a manufactured controversy where he claimed to be banned from Ohio Stadium by coach Ryan Day due to his allegiance to Michigan. He appeared on camera in a disguise, including a fake mustache and an 'I Love Ryan Day' hat, playfully escalating the rivalry. Ohio State officials had clarified that he wasn't banned but simply wasn't part of the main desk crew permitted inside the stadium for the broadcast.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor, who continues to write books and give presentations, attributes his sharp memory to five daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress and depression, which can contribute to memory loss. He also advocates for lifelong learning by reading widely outside one's expertise, using an organizational system like color-coded notes, and engaging in daily physical activity to increase blood flow to the brain. Finally, he stresses maintaining a healthy diet, proper hydration, and getting at least seven hours of sleep each night to support overall cognitive function and brain health.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean—have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They traveled over 9,000 miles non-stop from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance from South America to Australia. Throughout their journey, they faced numerous challenges, including severe storms and injuries, while successfully raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their arrival was celebrated by family and supporters, marking a historic achievement in maritime endurance and charitable fundraising.</p>

          <p>A growing trend, amplified by social media, sees brides purchasing numerous outfits for a series of wedding-related events, from engagement parties to bachelorette trips and post-wedding brunches. Experts note that what was once a single-day affair has evolved into a multi-event season, with the average bride now buying around 12 different looks. One bride reported spending nearly $18,000 on 15 outfits to ensure a unique look for every photographed moment. This shift is driven by a desire to match the increasing extravagance of weddings and the pop culture pressure to create Instagram-ready celebrations, leading retailers to expand their 'little white dress' collections.</p>

Wales, needing a victory to keep their progression hopes alive, started brightly but were ultimately overwhelmed by the world's second-ranked team. Canada established a bonus-point lead in the first half with tries from McKinley Hunt, Alysha Corrigan, and Asia Hogan-Rochester. Despite an improved effort from Wales, their World Cup fate now depends on the outcome of the Fiji versus Scotland match, leaving their campaign hanging by a thread.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $950 million, the sixth-largest in the game's history, after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant taxation. A mandatory 24% federal withholding is taken immediately, with winners likely owing more at tax time due to being in the top 37% tax bracket. State taxes also apply in most jurisdictions, though eight states, including California, Florida, and Texas, do not tax lottery winnings at all. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic quality, and post-graduation earnings. Despite high tuition, students at top-ranked schools like Princeton, Caltech, and MIT often pay a lower average net price due to generous financial aid and go on to earn high median incomes a decade after attendance. Many of these elite institutions have 'no-loan' policies or cover full tuition for families below certain income thresholds, significantly boosting their value proposition.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management has announced a significant investment in Rexford Industrial Realty, an industrial REIT focused on the Southern California market. The article suggests that while Rexford holds a prime portfolio, its stock has underperformed due to issues like poor corporate governance, misaligned management interests, and bloated expenses. Elliott, known for its activist approach, is expected to push for changes in governance and capital allocation to unlock shareholder value. The move also positions Rexford as a potential acquisition target, as Elliott has a history of catalyzing strategic mergers and sales within the REIT sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pastor diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, a rare and serious condition that caused his heart to become 'hard like cement,' survived a major cardiac arrest thanks to the CPR training his family had received from his doctor.

AL amyloidosis involves abnormal proteins accumulating on organs, and is often diagnosed late. Eighteen months after his transplants, the pastor has made a remarkable recovery, returning to his pulpit and even participating in a 5K run with the hospital staff who saved his life.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that despite recent studies on guaranteed income pilots showing lackluster results on metrics like mental health and employment, the fundamental effectiveness of cash transfers is well-established. The author contends that these recent pilots were conducted during unique economic circumstances, including a pandemic and high inflation, which may have muted their impact. Decades of research on programs like Social Security and food stamps consistently show that giving money to people in poverty is the most direct and effective way to reduce poverty. The article concludes that while cash is not a panacea for systemic issues like housing shortages, it remains a proven and powerful tool. (not investment advice)</p>
