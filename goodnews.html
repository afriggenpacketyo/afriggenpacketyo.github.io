          <p>Cooper Flagg, the first overall pick in the NBA draft, recently made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks in the Las Vegas Summer League. Despite a self-described poor first game, he demonstrated significant playmaking and defensive skills, following up with a 31-point performance in his second appearance. The 18-year-old phenom from Maine is widely considered one of the most complete teenage prospects in decades, drawing comparisons to NBA legends for his intense work ethic and focus. His reserved, professional demeanor off the court further highlights his singular dedication to basketball and continuous improvement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has utilized generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original series for the first time, signaling a significant shift in production techniques. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that AI was used to generate a building collapse scene in the Argentine show "The Eternauts," completing the sequence ten times faster and at a much lower cost than traditional methods. This development comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry, where unions and creators have raised concerns about AI replacing human jobs and potential copyright issues. The announcement coincided with Netflix reporting strong quarterly revenue and profit growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The space technology sector saw a significant increase in investment during the second quarter, reaching $3.1 billion, largely driven by interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment. U.S. firms captured the majority of this funding, with year-to-date investment already surpassing the total for all of 2024. The report highlights strong momentum for ventures in crewed space stations, on-orbit servicing, and energy solutions, with venture capital firms being the most active investors. This trend is bolstered by new public listings, like Firefly Aerospace, indicating sustained confidence in the commercial space industry's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect capable of detecting faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This biomimetic technology is reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering a significant leap in detection capabilities. Infrared sensing is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate smoke, fog, and dust to provide clear imaging. The fire beetle's unique thoracic pit organ, which evolved to find cooling wildfires for reproduction, provided the biological blueprint for this technological advancement, which could enhance China's defense systems.</p>

          <p>Despite engaging in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the war's outbreak, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded, driven by strong foreign investment, a resilient tech sector, and renewed investor confidence. The country's GDP has shown modest growth, with the OECD forecasting a 4.9% expansion in 2026. This economic buoyancy is attributed to the dynamism of its high-tech industry, which constitutes 20% of GDP, and increased foreign interest in its defense sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a $9 billion spending cuts package, sending the legislation to President Trump for his signature. The bill, approved by the House in a narrow 216-213 vote, rescinds previously allocated funds, including $8 billion for the U.S. Agency for International Development and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans framed the passage as a key victory for fiscal responsibility and a step toward controlling government spending. The vote followed intense partisan debate, with Democrats criticizing the cuts to foreign aid and public media services.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood expectation that adults have everything figured out. The piece explores the idea that most people are 'winging it' through a continuous process of becoming. Drawing a parallel to the French comedy show "Bref," the author discusses themes of aging, regret, and identity, particularly as an immigrant who feels neither fully American nor fully French. Ultimately, the author embraces the uncertainty of life, finding value in relationships, self-acceptance, and remaining open to the unexpected, even amidst a turbulent world.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream by successfully building and piloting his own 7-meter-long submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, was fascinated by machines since childhood but was inspired to build an underwater vessel after seeing one on a television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the submarine. His creation has since become a local spectacle, drawing stares from villagers as he navigates it through a quiet river near his home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and meeting economists' expectations. The slowdown was partly driven by an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent inflationary pressures and the risk of a depreciating yen could still pose challenges to the country's economic landscape.
