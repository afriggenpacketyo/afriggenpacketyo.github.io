          <p>Coinbase has become the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its inclusion in the index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may still have significant growth potential, partly due to its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with the recently listed and surging Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. The company has also expanded its services by partnering with American Express, Shopify, and JPMorgan, bolstering its utility beyond simple crypto trading. Despite concerns over declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is optimistic about future legislative clarity driving further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has unveiled a $961 billion budget proposal that prioritizes funding for President Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense system and next-generation F-47 fighter jets. The request, split between discretionary spending and a larger reconciliation bill, signals a shift by reducing the procurement of F-35 jets. The budget also allocates increased funding for the Space Force, boosts spending on low-cost drones, and includes a 3.8% pay raise for military personnel while planning to cut over 7,000 civilian employee positions. The administration is pushing Congress to pass the comprehensive funding package before the July 4th holiday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision limits the power of individual federal judges to issue universal injunctions, which are court orders that block the government from enforcing a policy nationwide. The ruling, which arose from challenges to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, found that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority Congress has granted to federal courts. While seen as a victory for the Trump administration, the decision does not eliminate challenges to executive orders. Instead, legal experts suggest future litigation will likely shift toward other methods, such as class-action lawsuits, to achieve widespread relief against federal policies.</p>

          <p>Honduran experimental pop artist Isabella Lovestory is releasing her second album, "Vanity," a project inspired by folkloric vampires and a mood board of mid-2000s club hits. The record blends electroclash and reggaeton, moving away from the grittier sound of her debut to explore themes of self-image, beauty, and vulnerability. As a self-sustaining artist who handles everything from her music videos to album art, she views her persona as a form of performance art. The album reflects her journey as an immigrant and an artist, creating a unique, post-genre sound that is both personal and evocative.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have finalized an agreement to accelerate the shipment of rare-earth minerals to America, a move that provided a temporary boost to U.S. stock markets. The deal aims to resolve supply chain disruptions caused by China's earlier suspension of critical mineral exports, which were part of its retaliation against U.S. tariffs. These materials are vital for numerous industries, including automotive, aerospace, and defense manufacturing. While the agreement marks potential progress in the ongoing trade disputes, the White House has signaled flexibility on its broader tariff deadlines as it continues complex negotiations with multiple nations.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is abuzz with speculation about Max Verstappen potentially leaving Red Bull for Mercedes, fueled by comments from current Mercedes driver George Russell. While Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028, the team's recent performance dip and questions about its new engine for 2026 have made a move seem plausible. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has not denied talks are occurring, though he called the signing "not realistic at this stage." A potential move creates a complex situation for Mercedes, involving driver salaries, team dynamics, and the future of their own young drivers, George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.</p>

Coach Andy Farrell has selected a formidable backline, with Scottish fly-half Finn Russell poised to be a central figure in the team's creative attack.

          <p>Nearly three decades ago, an 8-year-old gorilla named Binti Jua became an international hero at the Brookfield Zoo near Chicago. When a 3-year-old boy fell 24 feet into her enclosure and was knocked unconscious, Binti Jua gently picked him up, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers to retrieve him. Her actions, which stunned onlookers, were widely attributed to her maternal instincts, as she had her own baby on her back at the time. The incident stands in stark contrast to the 2016 Harambe case and cemented Binti Jua's legacy; now 37, she still resides at the zoo.</p>

Tarvet, who will earn at least ¬£66,000 for reaching the first round, expressed his belief that he deserves the money he has worked hard to earn and hopes to see a change in the rules.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," marks a deliberate return to the electronic sounds and youthful confusion of her earlier work, moving away from the relaxed vibe of "Solar Power." The album is set in downtown Manhattan and explores themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-obsession through a lens of almost religious reverence for the self. While the production by Jim-E Stack incorporates modern, distorted textures, the review suggests the album's potential thrill is often muted by a sense of creative compromise. The article argues that while Lorde's influence on pop is undeniable, her intense inward focus on this record reflects a broader cultural trend where self-obsession can feel redundant.</p>
