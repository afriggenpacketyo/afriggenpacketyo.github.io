          <p>Following the death of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan at age 71, fellow WWE icon Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson shared a heartfelt tribute on social media. Johnson recalled a personal childhood memory of Hogan and reflected on their historic WrestleMania X8 match, which he described as a symbolic "passing of the torch." He praised Hogan as a childhood hero and credited him with selling out arenas across the country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest of all time. WWE also honored Hogan with a 10-bell salute and a video tribute during its "SmackDown!" broadcast.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a two-day visit to the Maldives, aiming to reinforce relations with the nation amid its increasing alignment with China. The visit comes after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, elected on a pro-China platform, requested the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. In a move to mend ties, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line, reduced repayment terms on a previous loan, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic effort underscores the geopolitical significance of the Maldives, located on key Indian Ocean shipping lanes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:25:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, according to director Gurinder Chadha. The 2002 movie, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is celebrated for inspiring a generation of female soccer players. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the current momentum in women's sports make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup, hoping to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Arsenal has officially signed Sweden international striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a fee of €73 million. The 27-year-old, who signed a five-year contract, was a top scorer in Portugal, netting 54 goals in 52 games last season. Gyokeres stated that his decision was influenced by Arsenal's impressive performance when they played against his former team in the Champions League. The acquisition is a key part of Arsenal's summer spending spree as the club aims to strengthen its squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting six types of 'longevity foods' she wishes were more available in American stores. She was impressed by the incredible variety of traditional Japanese items, including a wide selection of seaweeds like mozuku and nori, and numerous soy-based products such as freeze-dried tofu. The store also offered a diverse range of seasonal Japanese produce, healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a vast assortment of green tea, all staples of a diet associated with longevity.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an effort to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative majority it lost in the last election. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups concerned that the KMT, which advocates for closer ties with Beijing, was obstructing key legislation and undermining Taiwan's democracy. The KMT framed the result as a public choice for stability over political infighting.</p>

          <p>The health impacts of daily coffee consumption remain a complex topic, with experts advising that the right amount varies for each individual. While some research links one to three cups a day to heart health benefits, other studies suggest high consumption can increase dementia risk. The FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine daily, but tolerance differs, and some people may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Experts stress the importance of moderation, being mindful of personal reactions, and not replacing meals with caffeine, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has discovered that a family of "junk" DNA sequences, known as MER11, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression. These sequences, called transposable elements, were previously thought to be non-functional remnants of ancient viral infections. The study, published in Science Advances, found that younger versions of these elements can act like genetic switches, influencing which genes are turned on or off without altering the underlying DNA code. This finding suggests that a vast portion of the human genome, once considered clutter, has evolved to perform important regulatory functions.</p>

          <p>A routine pre-surgery X-ray led to a life-saving diagnosis for Christopher Kennedy, who was found to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease with no known cause. Initially asymptomatic, Kennedy's condition progressed until he had less than a year to live, prompting doctors to suggest a double-lung transplant. Despite initial reluctance, the 74-year-old was approved and successfully underwent the procedure. Now 75, Kennedy has recovered to 98% lung capacity and is training a new Bernese Mountain dog, named Encore, to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>More employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits, a trend encouraged by a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that made a key tax exclusion permanent. The law allows employers to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans on a tax-free basis, with the amount now set to be adjusted for inflation. As the federal government alters its own loan repayment systems, workplace benefits are becoming an increasingly vital lifeline for workers burdened with debt, serving as a powerful tool for companies to attract and retain talent.
