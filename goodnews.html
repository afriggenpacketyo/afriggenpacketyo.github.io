          <p>A New York Times article reports that new clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Federal officials are questioning the necessity of Covid vaccines for children under 12, and some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines. Some public health experts agree that annual booster shots might offer only marginal benefits to younger, healthy Americans, while others emphasize the importance of vaccines for high-risk groups. The article highlights the ongoing debate about vaccine recommendations and the potential impact on public health. </p>

          <p>A New York Times article details the experience of the Langton family, who were among the first group of white South Africans to arrive in the United States after President Trump created an expedited path to citizenship. The family, who are Afrikaners, said they had been threatened in South Africa because they were white farmers and their business had suffered due to racial hatred. The family is settling in Birmingham, Alabama, and expressed gratitude to President Trump for the opportunity to leave South Africa. The situation has sparked debate over refugee status and the treatment of different groups seeking refuge in the United States.</p>
