          <p>Shares of Core Scientific, a bitcoin mining company, surged over 30% following reports that AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave is in talks to acquire it.

The company's market capitalization has now reached nearly $5 billion, reflecting a significant turnaround driven by the AI boom.

          <p>The market for stablecoins is attracting significant interest from Wall Street, with experts predicting it could grow into a multi-trillion dollar industry, comparable to the advent of credit cards. Companies like Fiserv and Mastercard are already integrating stablecoin technology, while major private firms such as ScaleAI and SpaceX use them for global payments. As regulatory clarity improves, traditional financial institutions are expected to enter the space, which is currently dominated by Circle and Tether.

Nike's finance chief stated that this quarter represents the "largest financial impact" from its ongoing turnaround plan.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, signaling a broader move toward deregulation under the Trump administration. The proposal would alter the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, allowing major banks to lend more freely and potentially boosting their profitability and shareholder returns. While bank investors have welcomed the move, some Fed governors dissented, warning that reducing capital cushions could increase systemic risk in the financial system. This is seen as the first step in a wider rollback of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the deadlines are "not critical," suggesting flexibility for nations engaged in good-faith trade negotiations with the U.S. This softens the administration's previous hardline stance, which had set a 90-day window for nearly 90 countries to strike new trade deals or face significant tariffs. The potential extension signals a more pragmatic approach as the deadlines near with few new agreements finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have risen recently, there are three key dates this summer when they could potentially fall. Analysts point to the release of the June inflation report on July 15 and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17 as potential catalysts for a rate reduction. A cooling inflation report or a formal rate cut by the Fed would likely lead to lower variable rates for HELOC borrowers. The September meeting is considered the most probable time for a cut.

          <p>This financial analysis compares the interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. With current rates, 3-month and 6-month CDs slightly outperform high-yield savings accounts, while a 9-month CD earns slightly less. Because the earnings are very similar, the best choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate changes. Locking in a CD rate may be wise if rates are expected to fall, whereas a savings account offers more flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

The court upheld a civil conviction against de Llano for moral damages and established a crucial precedent that the statute of limitations does not apply in civil cases involving the sexual assault of a minor. Sokol celebrated the decision, stating it "transcends my personal case" and opens a path to justice for other victims. De Llano must issue a public apology and pay damages.</p>
