        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Democrats have cast their votes in the mayoral primary, but the race remains undecided due to ranked-choice voting. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in initial tallies. Mamdani secured endorsements from prominent progressives, while Cuomo, despite past scandals, is considered a frontrunner. Ranked-choice voting will determine the winner as the process involves eliminating candidates with the least votes in each round until one candidate secures over 50% of the vote, with the final outcome expected in early July. The outcome of the election may have implications for the future direction of the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of dying stars to study star formation in the Milky Way's past. They found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. The extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study, based on data from the Gaia space telescope, provides direct evidence that star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. The research offers a new way to study the galaxy's evolution.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission has approved a new policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls. The drones will be used in situations such as high-risk incidents, investigations, large-scale events, and natural disasters. The LAPD said the technology offers crucial real-time information to responding officers. The pilot program will launch next month in four police divisions. Critics have expressed concerns about the potential for unconstitutional use and disproportionate deployment against communities of color.</p>
