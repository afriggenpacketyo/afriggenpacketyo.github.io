          <p>Researchers in the UK are analyzing the DNA of the "Druids Oak," an 800-year-old tree, to understand its remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other environmental stressors. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify specific genes responsible for the longevity and hardiness of ancient oaks. Scientists hope this genetic information will help them select the most robust trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands and the diverse ecosystems they support. The study will encompass about 50 of the UK's most famous ancient oak trees.</p>

          <p>Bev Johnson is marking her 42nd year as a host at WDIA in Memphis, the first radio station in the United States to feature all-Black programming. Since its inception in 1947, WDIA has served as a vital community resource, providing news, music, and information often ignored by mainstream outlets, including stories on civil rights and police brutality. Johnson, known as "your girlfriend" to her listeners, continues this legacy by offering a platform for community leaders and experts to provide essential advice. The station also played a crucial role in preserving the Lorraine Motel, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum.</p>

          <p>Beginning in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the National Health Service. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Officials hope the move will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work, estimated to cost the UK £24 million annually in lost productivity.</p>

          <p>Zhao Changpeng, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, believes Hong Kong has the potential to rival the U.S. and UAE as a major hub for virtual assets. In an exclusive interview, he emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed at which its regulators adapt and embrace the Web3 industry. Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to support the sector but needs to act quickly to capitalize on its potential. One key recommendation he made was to expand the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges in the city.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a wide range of critical reactions. Directed by Noah Baumbach, the movie features Clooney as an aging movie star grappling with a midlife crisis, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. Some critics have hailed it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece" with a knockout performance from Clooney, while others have dismissed it as "dire" and "self-indulgent." The film, which also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private reality, potentially positioning Clooney for awards consideration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to auto research firm Edmunds, the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a prime opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is largely due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for leased EVs that is set to expire on September 30. Leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows consumers to try the technology without committing to a long-term purchase amid rapid advancements. The IRS has also clarified that customers who sign a contract and make a down payment before the deadline are eligible for the credit, even if the vehicle is delivered later.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as a major consumer of palm oil, China can play a crucial role in promoting sustainability within Indonesia's palm oil industry. The article contextualizes this by noting Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's recent crackdown on illegal plantations that have led to widespread deforestation, with 3.7 million hectares confirmed as illegal. The author posits that global demand, particularly from markets like China, drives the industry's expansion. Therefore, by leveraging its market power to demand more sustainable and transparent sourcing, China could significantly influence Indonesia's efforts to balance economic growth with environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to work with local law enforcement in major cities across the state. While touting data showing that overall crime is down in California, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The announcement comes amid criticism from President Trump about crime in blue states. Newsom contrasted his collaborative, data-driven approach with what he called the President's "militarizing" of American cities, emphasizing that his plan is a response to community desires, not political pressure.</p>
