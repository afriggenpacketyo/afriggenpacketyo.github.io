          <p>President Trump announced that the United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed on a path for the UAE to purchase advanced American-made semiconductors for AI development, potentially involving a large contract for Nvidia's H100 chips. This move aims to boost the UAE's AI infrastructure and its goal of becoming a global technology hub. However, concerns remain among security professionals and lawmakers that easing export controls could allow sensitive American technology to reach rivals like China, despite the Trump administration's plan to rescind the 'AI diffusion rule.'</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, totaling 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion), as investors moved away from U.S. markets following trade actions by President Trump. These inflows, the largest since 1996, were driven primarily by institutional investors such as pension funds and asset managers seeking safe-haven assets. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the exceptional inflows in April highlight a shift in global investor sentiment towards diversifying away from U.S. assets due to tariff-related economic concerns.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying efforts to strengthen its domestic market to reduce vulnerability to external tariff shocks, even with a tentative ceasefire in the trade war with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of bolstering 'domestic circulation' to enhance economic self-reliance and offset global uncertainties. This strategy involves creating a robust, unified domestic market and reducing the economy‚Äôs dependence on overseas trade, as China recognizes it can no longer rely solely on exports for growth.</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment, offering hope for thousands with uncommon genetic diseases. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to fix the baby's precise mutation, leading to significant improvements in his condition. This breakthrough builds on decades of federally funded research and offers a new path for developing personalized treatments without extensive testing, potentially transforming healthcare for rare genetic disorders.</p>
