          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed what Trump described as a lengthy phone call between the two leaders and comes as he seeks to resolve the conflict, a key promise of his 2024 campaign. The planned summit reflects a recent shift in Trump's tone, who has expressed more frustration with Putin for prolonging the war. The meeting will be preceded by discussions between high-level advisers from both nations.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Formula 1 United States Grand Prix has been officially declared a "heat hazard" race due to forecasted temperatures exceeding 31°C (88°F) in Austin, Texas. This new designation is triggered when a heat index indicates potentially dangerous conditions for the drivers. As a result of the declaration, drivers will have the option to use in-car cooling vests to mitigate the effects of the heat. If a driver chooses not to use the vest, their car must carry an equivalent amount of ballast weight to ensure competitive fairness.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues its campaign of interest rate cuts, the earnings potential of high-yield savings accounts is diminishing, making it crucial for savers to avoid common errors. This article advises against using local bank branches, which typically offer lower rates than online-only banks. It also suggests diversifying savings by placing some funds in a fixed-rate Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in current rates. Finally, it notes that despite lower returns, these accounts remain significantly more profitable than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>
