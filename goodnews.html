        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson discusses the recently passed tax and border bill, emphasizing its potential to stimulate the U.S. economy through tax reductions and deregulation. He argues that the bill, estimated to cost between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade, includes significant savings for the American people and investments in American energy and military infrastructure. Johnson defends the bill against criticisms from Senate Republicans, who express concerns about its impact on the national debt, and addresses concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food stamps by asserting that the bill targets fraud, waste, and abuse in these programs. He maintains that the bill will benefit all Americans and that concerns about tariffs are subsiding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on creating a secure environment for children to express their emotions freely. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, who are encouraged to accept their child's emotions without judgment and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents set boundaries with empathy rather than control, preventing shame by reconnecting after conflicts and modeling healthy repair. The framework involves parents doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after overcoming a recent incident where his truck was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had switched banks and forgot to update his automatic payment settings for his Ford F-150, resulting in the repossession. He discovered the truck was gone when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage, which revealed a tow truck taking the vehicle. Fortunately, Paul was able to recover his truck, adding a humorous touch by posting the repossession footage with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Julie Moore, an Army wife, significantly changed military protocol for casualty notifications after experiencing the impersonal nature of telegrams during the Vietnam War. Outraged by the cold and cruel delivery of death notices, she made a deal with the local Western Union office to be notified of telegrams so she could comfort the widows. Her efforts led to a fundamental change in the Army, with service members now personally notifying families and offering additional support. Her legacy is honored at Ft. Moore, which was renamed in her and her husband's honor, marking the first time an American military base was named for a civilian.</p>

Not only did the pair once have the longest undefended border in the world, spanning roughly 9,000 kilometres, they shared books too.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured victory at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race win. The race began amid uncertainty as to how the new rule imposed to increase jeopardy would play out, and amid predictions of wild strategies and potential chaos. Norris converted his excellent pole position - his first since the season-opener in Australia - into a lead at the first corner as the top 10 moved off in grid order. Verstappen went into the race at a disadvantage in having only one set each of the medium and hard tyres available, which required him to use the softs.</p>

          <p>Hikers exploring the Krkono≈°e Mountains in the Czech Republic discovered a mysterious cache of gold bracelets, cigar cases, a powder compact, and hundreds of coins. The trove was found inside an aluminum box jutting from a stony wall. Experts at the Museum of Eastern Bohemia are studying the pieces, speculating on their origin, with hypotheses ranging from pre-World War II departures of Czech and Jewish populations to the post-war German exodus in 1945. However, the most recent coin is dated 1921, adding to the mystery.</p>
