        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic data shows UK wage growth cooled to 4.7% in the three months to August, a slight decrease from the previous period. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate edged up to 4.8%, with the increase primarily driven by younger individuals. Despite a 39th consecutive drop in job vacancies, analysts see these figures as a sign of the labor market stabilizing after significant volatility. The Bank of England may delay interest rate cuts due to persistent wage growth, although economists anticipate a future easing as the market loosens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen-year-old Cameron McGerr is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both of his parents to heart conditions. He believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father, who died from a cardiac arrest earlier this year. Motivated by his loss, he successfully persuaded his own school to introduce the life-saving training and has now taken his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament. His powerful testimony has garnered support, and he is now scheduled to meet with the Education Secretary to discuss a nationwide rollout.</p>

          <h2>England Football Grapples with Lack of Striker Depth Behind Captain Harry Kane</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The England national football team is facing a shortage of traditional center-forwards to serve as backup for its captain, Harry Kane. With Kane's usual deputy, Ollie Watkins, injured, the lack of depth in the number nine position has become more apparent. Only seven English out-and-out strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, a trend noted with concern by the Under-21s manager. As England nears qualification for the next World Cup, the debate intensifies over who can reliably fill the crucial role if the prolific Bayern Munich star is unavailable.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is strongly advocating for the urgent implementation of a national screening program for prostate cancer. As an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, he argues that a targeted program focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men, would be affordable and save many lives. The charity estimates the program would cost £25 million annually and utilize more reliable MRI scans alongside traditional tests. This call comes as the UK National Screening Committee re-evaluates its current stance against routine screening.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a 1,600-year-old masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," using a combination of artificial intelligence and expert analysis. The original work by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi had survived only in fragments, with just a quarter of its verses intact. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving 250 characters, the team used AI to generate the remaining text, creating a complete 919-character scroll. This project showcases the potential of AI to preserve and revitalize ancient cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A new campaign in the UK will encourage people applying for a driving licence to also register as blood donors. The initiative, a partnership between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant, will add a registration link to emails sent to millions of applicants each year. The goal is to appeal directly to younger people, as over half of current regular donors are over 45, and address a persistent blood shortage. Officials hope to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the driving licence application since 1994.</p>
