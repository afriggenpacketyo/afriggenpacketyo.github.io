Pugh, who has swum in extreme conditions around the world, described this swim as one of his most challenging due to the cold water, strong winds, and the mental strain of swimming in shark-inhabited waters. He aims to change public perceptions of sharks, which he says have been unfairly vilified, and to promote their protection.

          <p>England secured a clean sweep in the T20 series against the West Indies, winning the third and final match by 17 runs despite an outstanding performance from West Indies' Hayley Matthews. Matthews scored a brilliant 71, but a rain delay disrupted the chase, leading to a collapse in the West Indies' batting order. Lauren Bell's exceptional bowling, along with contributions from Em Arlott, Linsey Smith, and Charlie Dean, helped England seal the victory. Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 in England's innings set the stage for the win, though she suffered a hamstring injury.</p>

          <p>George Lucas's Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles is experiencing turbulence as it approaches completion, including the departure of its director and staff reductions. Lucas has assumed the role of head of "content direction," raising questions about the museum's mission and vision. The museum, plagued by construction delays and high costs, aims to explore how narrative art influences societies, but its scope and focus remain unclear. The changes reflect Lucas's desire to ensure the museum reflects his vision and legacy, but some worry about the impact of his direct control on the institution's curatorial expertise.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which is associated with a large surge in China, have been detected in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say the symptoms are similar to earlier strains and the variant appears to be more transmissible but not more severe. The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to some groups, prompting concerns about public health impacts.

          <h2>EU Seeks Swift Trade Deal with US After Tariff Delay</h2>

          <p>EU leaders are hopeful for a quick resolution to the trade war with the US after President Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs on the bloc until July 9. The delay followed a call between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to fast-track trade negotiations. While European markets responded positively, businesses remain uncertain amid the flip-flopping on border taxes. The EU has reiterated its offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods, but key issues such as the US trade deficit in goods remain unresolved.</p>
