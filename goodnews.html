          <p>Former President Trump, alongside major technology and energy executives, announced over $90 billion in new investments for Pennsylvania at a summit at Carnegie Mellon University. The initiative aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy in the state by leveraging its energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear power. Key projects include the construction of energy-intensive data centers for AI and a new worker training innovation center. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers across the state, signaling a major push for technological and economic development in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghan nationals. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court has paused the move for one week to review legal briefs. This decision provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans who rely on TPS for deportation protection and work authorization. Advocacy groups praised the ruling as a critical, though temporary, measure, while the White House criticized it as judicial overreach into immigration policy.</p>

In a notable moment, 15-year-old British actor Owen Cooper made history as one of the youngest nominees ever for his role in "Adolescence." The nominations also recognized Harrison Ford with his first-ever Emmy nod at age 83 for his work in "Shrinking." The awards ceremony will celebrate achievements in television and honor the winners in Los Angeles on September 14.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced it will expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles by moving the manufacturing of its Cadillac Escalade SUV to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. The facility will also add production of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickup trucks, starting in early 2027, to meet strong consumer demand. This decision builds on GM's previously announced $4 billion investment in its U.S. facilities. The move is notable as the Orion plant was originally slated to be an electric vehicle-exclusive facility, indicating a strategic adjustment to continue supporting its popular internal combustion engine models.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon is set to use a Falcon 9 rocket from rival SpaceX to launch its next batch of 24 Kuiper internet satellites. This move highlights the intense pressure on Amazon to deploy its satellite constellation and compete with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service. Amazon must have approximately 1,600 satellites in orbit by July 2026 to meet FCC requirements, necessitating a massive number of launches. The partnership underscores the high-stakes competition in the satellite internet market between two of the world's wealthiest individuals, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Indonesia, stating he has agreed to lower a planned 32% tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump claimed the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has committed to purchasing billions in American energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. The agreement, which has not yet been confirmed by Indonesia, comes after the White House renewed tariff threats against numerous countries. This pact is one of only a few reached since the administration initiated a broad campaign of trade negotiations this spring.</p>
