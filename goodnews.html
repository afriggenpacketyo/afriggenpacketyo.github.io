          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly significantly increased its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by massive demand for its drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from Mounjaro reached nearly $5.2 billion, while Zepbound sales hit $3.38 billion, both exceeding analyst predictions. Despite this strong performance, the company's stock saw a premarket drop following trial results for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which showed slightly less weight loss than anticipated. The company's updated guidance reflects existing tariffs but not potential future levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight in a late-stage clinical trial, a result that fell slightly below some Wall Street expectations of around 15%. The data caused the company's shares to drop, while shares of rival Novo Nordisk rose. Despite the market reaction, some medical experts praised the result as a significant and clinically meaningful outcome for an oral medication, which could expand access for patients hesitant about injections. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Despite economic challenges like high interest rates and President Trump's tariff policies, the U.S. stock market continues to show remarkable growth, baffling many analysts. Traditional explanations, such as economic fundamentals or Federal Reserve liquidity, no longer seem to fully account for the market's resilience and record highs. Newer theories point to a speculative bubble driven by hype around artificial intelligence, or a structural shift caused by the dominance of passive investment funds. This analytical piece from The Atlantic explores how each prevailing theory has been undermined by recent events, leaving the market's trajectory largely unexplained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the current average interest rates for mortgages and refinancing, providing guidance for homebuyers and homeowners in a market characterized by high rates and limited inventory. As of August 6, 2025, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.75%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.88%. The report suggests that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure good rates and that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief. It advises consumers to strengthen their credit and shop around with different lenders to find the best possible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 7, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,387.35 per ounce, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset for investors during periods of economic uncertainty. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by multiple factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, and geopolitical instability. Because gold is priced in U.S. dollars, its cost is also inversely affected by currency fluctuations. The piece serves as a guide for potential investors, explaining the dynamics that cause short-term price fluctuations in the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly set to visit China at the end of August for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. This potential visit signifies a continued thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which had deteriorated significantly after a deadly border clash in 2020. The meeting comes as India's relationship with the United States faces strain over trade issues, including newly announced tariffs, prompting speculation that New Delhi may be recalibrating its strategic approach toward Beijing. Neither government has officially confirmed the visit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut its key interest rate to 4% will have varied effects on UK households, as explained in this article. For those with variable-rate mortgages, the cut could lead to lower monthly payments, though most homeowners on fixed-rate deals will not see an immediate change. Conversely, the lower rate is expected to further reduce already falling interest rates on savings accounts, diminishing returns for savers. The central bank's move is part of a strategy to manage inflation and a cooling jobs market, balancing the need to stimulate economic activity against price stability.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter results that missed earnings estimates but beat revenue expectations. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and a 3.4% same-store sales increase at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes was a weak spot, with same-store sales declining by 1.4%. Burger King's U.S. division saw a modest 1.5% sales increase as its restaurant renovation program continues. The company reiterated its full-year forecast, maintaining its long-term growth targets through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a closely divided decision, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%. The move reflects the central bank's challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which rose to 3.6% in June, against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The committee was initially split, with some members favoring a hold and one advocating for a larger cut, before a second vote secured the majority for the reduction. The bank reiterated that its approach to further monetary easing will remain "gradual and careful." (not investment advice)</p>

This diplomatic outreach is seen as a pragmatic move by New Delhi to secure its strategic interests in the region, including trade routes and stability, and to ensure it is not sidelined in post-war reconstruction.
