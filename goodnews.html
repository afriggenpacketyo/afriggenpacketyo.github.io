          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole during a gust of wind. The pole went through her armpit but miraculously missed all major arteries, nerves, and tendons. She remained remarkably calm throughout the ordeal as first responders used a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport to the hospital. After a successful recovery, she expressed gratitude to her rescuers and plans to return to her lifeguarding duties in six weeks.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first direct images of a potential exoplanet, a significant milestone for the observatory. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, is a gas giant estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits the young star TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, revealing the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet.</p>

          <p>The victory of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist, in New York's mayoral primary has intensified the debate within the Democratic Party about its ideological direction. Mamdani's win over the more established Andrew Cuomo highlights a generational and progressive shift, with his campaign focusing on affordability issues like free child care and rent freezes. While progressive leaders celebrated the win, some moderate Democrats and conservative opponents have criticized his platform as extreme and unrealistic, raising questions about whether his playbook is a viable national strategy for the party.</p>

NASA confirmed the object was an asteroidal fragment about three feet in diameter that first appeared 48 miles above Oxford, Georgia. It disintegrated approximately 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT and causing a loud boom that was heard and felt across the region.

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial tax provision from President Trump's major spending bill at the request of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The provision, known as Section 899, would have allowed taxes on companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have 'unfair' tax policies, a measure critics warned would cost U.S. jobs and investment. The removal follows an agreement Bessent reached with G7 countries on a global tax deal, but it complicates Republican efforts to find ways to offset the cost of the massive legislative package.

Teran was accused of improperly downloading confidential police records while at the Sheriff's Department and using them in her role at the D.A.'s office. The court ruled that her actions were not criminal, as the documents in question were publicly available court records.
