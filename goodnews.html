          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has announced a new action plan to manage its strategic non-ferrous metals sector. The plan aims to curb rampant competition by reducing the projected output growth from 4.3% to 1.5% this year. Instead of focusing on volume, the government will prioritize optimizing the industrial structure and increasing value-added output. The initiative also calls for advancements in exploring key resources like copper and lithium, developing advanced materials, and enhancing recycling efforts for items such as batteries and solar panels.

The match, his first in charge, featured continued fan protests against the club's board. After Jarrod Bowen secured a point with a second-half equalizer, Nuno led his players to acknowledge the traveling supporters in a gesture of togetherness. He stated that his initial approach involves making simple, incremental improvements rather than drastic tactical changes to help the team compete better.</p>

This move into "agentic commerce," developed with payment processor Stripe, marks a significant step for ChatGPT into the e-commerce space.</p>

          <p>Despite a spirited final-day effort from the U.S. team, Europe's 15-13 victory in the Ryder Cup underscores fundamental differences in preparation and team culture. The article suggests that Europe's win was effectively secured in the first two days due to superior planning, data-driven strategy, and a collective ethos championed by Captain Luke Donald. In contrast, the U.S. approach under Captain Keegan Bradley was criticized as being more individualistic and emotionally driven. Europe's dominance in the foursomes format, a traditional American strength, is cited as a key indicator of their strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 53, a landmark piece of legislation creating new transparency and safety requirements for large artificial intelligence companies. The new law mandates that AI developers publicly disclose their safety protocols and report critical incidents, such as cyberattacks or unsafe system behaviors, to the state. Authored by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill aims to establish "commonsense guardrails" for the rapidly advancing technology. The law, which strengthens whistleblower protections, was opposed by some tech industry groups who argued it focuses on hypothetical rather than actual harms.</p>

          <p>A year after devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged eastern Tennessee, whitewater raft guides are leading a major cleanup effort on the Nolichucky River. The 2024 storm caused massive debris flows that made the popular rafting river unsafe, forcing most outfitters to close for the season. Through state-funded grants, many out-of-work guides have been hired for cleanup missions, removing debris like car parts and sheet metal from the riverbanks. Officials are optimistic that the restoration work will allow the river, informally dubbed the "New-lichucky," to reopen for the 2026 season.</p>
