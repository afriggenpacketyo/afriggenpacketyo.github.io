          <p>Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI to support the construction of massive data centers powered by its AI processors. The ambitious project aims to build and deploy systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to four to five million of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This monumental partnership deepens the ties between two of the main drivers of the current AI boom, highlighting the immense infrastructure required to develop next-generation artificial intelligence. The investment signals confidence in future AI advancements and is expected to be deployed progressively as the infrastructure is built.</p>

          <p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 occurred early Monday morning in the San Francisco Bay Area, with its epicenter located near Berkeley. The shaking was felt widely across the region, waking many residents just before 3 a.m. and prompting thousands to report the event to the U.S. Geological Survey. While the quake caused some initial alarm and minor transit delays for safety inspections, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The event serves as a reminder of the seismic risks inherent to the region.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup in England has been a resounding success, setting a new record for the largest crowd in women's rugby history with a sold-out 82,000-capacity final at Twickenham. The tournament has sold over 440,000 tickets in total, more than triple the amount from the previous event three years ago, running at nearly 94% capacity. Organizers attribute the success to strategic initiatives such as competitive ticket pricing, family-friendly weekend scheduling, and promoting the personalities of players from various teams, not just the host nation.

          <p>An elk nicknamed Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. The young male traveled through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, covering nearly 500 kilometers. Austrian wildlife officials tranquilized the elk after he strayed too close to a motorway. He was then fitted with a GPS tracking tag and released near the Czech border in the Sumava forest, where it is hoped he will join the region's small resident elk population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial, which is distributed by Constellation Brands. The shift marks a significant change in the beer market, reversing a trend from two years ago when Modelo had unseated Bud Light from the top spot. Bud Light's sales had fallen following conservative backlash to a marketing partnership. Modelo's recent decline in popularity is attributed to broader challenges for Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker demand among some consumer groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok involves creating a new U.S.-based joint venture to control the app's American operations. According to a White House official, the new entity will have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to oversee data and content recommendations. The deal is structured as a compromise to satisfy both U.S. national security laws and Chinese domestic regulations. The U.S. government will not take an equity stake or have a seat on the board of the new venture.</p>

          <p>As a central component of the deal to secure TikTok's future in the U.S., the app's powerful recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained using only American user data. A White House official confirmed that this new U.S.-specific algorithm will be operated by a new joint venture and audited by tech giant Oracle. This measure is designed to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate the algorithm or access U.S. user data through TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. The move aims to bring the core technology that drives the app's user experience under U.S. oversight.</p>

          <p>Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent British-Egyptian activist and a leading figure in the country's 2011 pro-democracy uprising. Abdel Fattah, who had been imprisoned for six years on charges of "spreading false news," was one of Egypt's most well-known political prisoners. His detention had drawn widespread international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign governments. The pardon followed a formal request from Egypt's National Council for Human Rights, and his family expressed immense relief upon hearing the news of his impending release.</p>

          <p>This article provides scientific context regarding the causes of autism, countering claims that it can be linked to a single factor like a common painkiller. Experts explain that autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with a strong polygenetic basis, meaning hundreds or thousands of gene variants contribute to the risk, rather than one specific cause. The rise in diagnoses over recent decades is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better screening methods. The scientific consensus remains that there is no link between vaccines and autism.</p>

          <p>Members of the blind and visually impaired community are finding new and empowering uses for Meta's AI-powered smart glasses. By connecting the glasses to the "Be My Eyes" app, users can receive real-time assistance from volunteers to help with everyday tasks like reading mail, identifying objects, or navigating grocery stores. The technology's optical character recognition can also read text from signs and menus aloud. While still a work in progress, users and advocates say the glasses are a significant step forward in enhancing daily autonomy and independence for visually impaired individuals.</p>
