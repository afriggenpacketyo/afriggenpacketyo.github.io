          <p>China is hosting an aviation management workshop for eight Southeast Asian countries to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, like the C919 jet. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to challenge the market dominance of Western manufacturers Airbus and Boeing in a region that is already a key recipient of Chinese planes. Analysts see this as a timely move for China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, to leverage growing economic cooperation and establish a stronger foothold in the global aviation industry.</p>

This significant increase highlights strong investor demand for Chinese tech startups, especially as the government signals renewed support for private enterprise. The platform, known as RedNote in the US, is gaining traction as a potential competitor to TikTok amid regulatory challenges faced by the latter in Western markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Sununu is seriously considering a run for his old New Hampshire Senate seat in 2026, following Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen's decision not to seek reelection.

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, that was looted by the Nazis during World War II has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork was part of the collection of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose holdings were seized by senior Nazi official Hermann Göring after Goudstikker's death in 1940. The painting was discovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing for a home linked to the descendants of a high-ranking Nazi lawyer who fled to Argentina after the war.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze $2.2 billion in research grant funding for Harvard University. The judge described the administration's action as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and vacated the orders, barring their enforcement. The funding was halted after Harvard rejected demands to reform its diversity programs and screen international students for ideological biases, which the university argued violated its First Amendment rights. The White House has stated its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. The court's majority opinion found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that mass illegal migration constitutes such an event. This ruling is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure wartime statute to expedite removals, which civil liberties groups have argued is an overreach of executive power.</p>

The deal settles a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to provide the necessary information using a provisional ballot at their polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them.</p>
