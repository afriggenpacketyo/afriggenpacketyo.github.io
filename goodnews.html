          <h2>TSA Quietly Ends Requirement for Passengers to Remove Shoes at Some U.S. Airports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has reportedly allowed the rule requiring passengers to remove shoes during standard security screening to expire at several U.S. airports. While the change appears to be a phased rollout, sources confirmed its implementation at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia. Travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt from this requirement. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security, but has not made a formal nationwide announcement.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he has nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in the ongoing Gaza war, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas resuming in Qatar. When asked about the potential forcible removal of Palestinians from Gaza, Netanyahu stated it would be a matter of "free choice." Trump also indicated the U.S. would resume sending more defensive weapons to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following a class-action lawsuit, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has announced it will sever ties with e-learning company Simplilearn. The lawsuit alleged that the university and its partner misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp, misleading students by implying it had close ties to Caltech faculty when the connection was minimal. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to 263 students and implement more transparent practices, representing a significant outcome for critics of university-third party online program partnerships.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russia's ongoing assault. The statement comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. During a White House event, Trump emphasized the necessity of the aid, stating Ukraine is "getting hit very hard." The U.S. has provided tens of billions in assistance since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct large-scale layoffs, which could have affected tens of thousands of employees in August. The VA stated that staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, attrition, and deferred resignations have eliminated the need for a formal reduction-in-force (RIF). The department is on pace to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year, a smaller number than the initially considered 80,000 cuts. Critics argue the high attrition rate is due to a toxic work environment.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there was no so-called "client list" related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The review also found no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals and reaffirmed that his death in federal custody was a suicide. This memo was released to address years of public speculation and conspiracy theories. Officials stated that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no purpose and that no further disclosure of materials, some containing graphic content, is warranted.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw received his 11th career All-Star selection, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The 37-year-old, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery, expressed surprise and gratitude for the honor. While he acknowledged he didn't feel he deserved the selection based on his 2025 performance, he called it a "tremendous honor" and a "weird but cool" way to be recognized. This selection ties him for the most among active players.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a planned $2.2 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones in conflicts like the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must instead invest in future-focused capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. Authorities stated that organizers, including Budapest's mayor, created public uncertainty about the event's legal status, leading participants to believe the march was lawful. This decision comes amid a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which passed a law in March allowing for the ban of such marches.</p>

Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system.

A second report, which will assign blame for the miscarriage of justice, is not expected until a later date.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests King Charles III is playing a crucial role in reinvigorating the UK-France relationship, as highlighted by French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit. The King's fluency in French and decades of diplomatic experience have helped reset relations that were strained by Brexit. His 2023 state visit to France was warmly received and laid the groundwork for the current summit. This royal diplomacy provides a soft power backdrop for critical discussions on defense, migration, and support for Ukraine between the two governments.</p>
