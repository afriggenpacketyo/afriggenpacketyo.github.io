          <p>Bank of America strategists report that investors are moving capital out of U.S. equities into European and Japanese markets, triggered by volatility stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. U.S. equities experienced an $8.9 billion outflow in one week, while European equities saw a $3.4 billion inflow, and Japanese equities saw their biggest week of inflows since April 2024 at $4.4 billion. This shift indicates a risk-taking mood among investors, as cryptocurrencies and high-yield bonds also saw inflows, while gold and U.S. Treasury bonds experienced outflows.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its full-year sales growth forecast downward due to the impact of copycat drug compounders on Wegovy sales, despite reporting a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. While sales of Wegovy rose 83%, they fell slightly short of analyst expectations, leading the company to project sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. First-quarter sales of Ozempic, another key diabetes treatment, exceeded expectations, but the overall adjustment reflects challenges in the competitive weight loss drug market.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal designed to reduce costs and simplify trade between the two nations, with the UK reducing taxes on goods imported from India, such as clothing, food products, and jewelry, while India has cut taxes on UK goods like cosmetics, scotch whisky, and medical devices. The UK government anticipates that this agreement will increase trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040 and boost the UK economy by ¬£4.8 billion over time. While the deal is not expected to have immediate effects, it could provide significant advantages for UK businesses in industries like car manufacturing and whisky distilling.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a $1.5 billion reduction in revenue this year, despite an otherwise optimistic outlook for 2025. The guidance is a direct result of an export restriction imposed in April that targeted AMD‚Äôs MI308 chips, causing a predicted $700 million decline in data center revenue for the current period. CEO Lisa Su remains confident about overall demand for AI infrastructure and expects new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year, though investors remain concerned about trade restrictions and competition with Nvidia.</p>
