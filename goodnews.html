          <p>The European Union is preparing to announce additional countermeasures in response to U.S. tariffs, according to European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic. These steps include possible rebalancing measures and areas for further discussions, as the EU continues to prepare for all scenarios if trade talks fail. While negotiations remain the priority, the EU is consulting with member states and industry stakeholders to ensure readiness for any outcome. Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU goods, later paused and lowered to 10% for negotiations, while tariffs on foreign cars, steel, and aluminum remain.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will cause inflation while also hindering economic growth. Fed officials are closely monitoring data for signs of rising consumer prices or a weakening labor market, seeking clarity on Trump's economic policies. The central bank's decision hinges on whether tariff-induced price increases are temporary or lead to persistent inflation. The article notes that the Fed faces tricky trade-offs, as sweeping tariffs, spending cuts, and mass deportations risk both stoking inflation and damaging growth.</p>

          <p>As the REAL ID Act goes into effect, travelers are expressing confusion and concern, despite TSA efforts to inform the public. While the TSA states personal identification "must be a REAL ID to travel," some passengers have noted recent messaging suggests additional screening may be an option. Passengers without REAL ID-compliant documents may face extra screening, but will still be allowed to fly, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Travelers are advised to arrive early for potential additional screenings and to have alternative forms of identification available.</p>

Those without Real ID-compliant documents were generally allowed to fly after additional screening, but received a warning notice for future travel.
