          <p>United Airlines flights across the United States were temporarily grounded due to a significant technology issue, leading to widespread passenger delays. The ground stop affected the airline's mainline flights at major hubs, including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, causing over 700 delays. The company confirmed the underlying technology problem was resolved later in the evening but warned of residual disruptions as normal operations were restored. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that the glitch was internal to the airline and not related to the broader U.S. air traffic control system.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires intensify globally due to climate change, experts are emphasizing the need for proactive forest management to build resilience against blazes. Strategies include converting flammable monocultures, like eucalyptus or pine, into more fire-resistant natural deciduous forests, though this is a long-term solution. In the short term, methods such as removing combustible ground material, creating wide firebreaks, and employing prescribed burning during cooler months are crucial. Experts also stress the importance of early detection systems and ensuring firefighters have adequate access to water resources to combat fires effectively before they spread uncontrollably.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group reported its second straight quarterly profit, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Fund technology investment arm. The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The positive performance of the Vision Fund was attributed to value increases in public holdings like Grab and private investments in Indian firms. This result comes as SoftBank continues its aggressive spending on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and the pending acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing.

The suspects are accused of being part of a terrorist organization that planned to violently overthrow the government. The arrests followed raids on four properties across Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia, where investigators believe the group held weapons training and planning meetings. This operation is part of an ongoing crackdown on the network, whose alleged ringleaders were arrested in 2022 for plotting an armed assault on the German parliament.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues for 'Letting Go' of Control in an Uncertain World</h2>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the tendency of political leaders to seek tight control is ill-suited for tackling the modern world's complex crises, such as climate change and economic instability. The author argues that this control-oriented mindset, whether in government or bureaucratic institutions, stifles the creative and collaborative thinking necessary for real change. Drawing on neuroscience and psychology, the piece suggests that while the human brain is wired for certainty, embracing uncertainty is crucial. The author advocates for a shift away from authoritarian control towards co-creation and pluralist thinking to renew democracies and address systemic challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, citing a strong harvest in Spain and improving market conditions. After a period of extreme price volatility caused by poor yields and high inflation, a bumper harvest has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices. This has allowed the maker of brands like Bertolli to lower shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. The company anticipates a more balanced and normalized market landscape for the remainder of 2025, a significant shift from the historic challenges faced recently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's trade performance in July surpassed market expectations, with exports growing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% year-over-year, the biggest jump in a year. The strong export data suggests resilience amid ongoing trade tensions and a ticking clock on a tariff truce with the U.S. However, exports to the U.S. continued to fall, a decline offset by increased shipments to alternative markets like Southeast Asia. The data also showed a significant recovery in imports, driven by increased purchases of soybeans and crude oil, indicating a potential rebound in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging nine-month mission in space. Wilmore co-piloted the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner, which was intended to be a short trip but was extended after the spacecraft experienced multiple technical issues. Due to safety concerns, he and his crewmate Suni Williams ultimately returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule. NASA praised Wilmore's dedication and legacy of fortitude, which follows a pattern of test pilots retiring after completing such inaugural, high-risk missions.</p>

          <p>Some financial experts contend that China is making progress in controlling its significant local government debt risks through a sweeping restructuring campaign. This perspective contrasts with long-held international fears of a "ticking time bomb" of hidden Chinese debt. Finance professor Zhao Xijun argues that China's debt is primarily held at the local level, allowing the central government to manage it, whereas the U.S. faces a more concerning situation with its debt concentrated at the federal level. China's debt-swap initiatives have successfully extended repayment maturities, a sign of stabilization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British athletics great Jonathan Edwards is marking the 30th anniversary of his triple jump world record of 18.29m, set on August 7, 1995. Edwards expresses surprise that the record still stands, suggesting it may not be a healthy sign for the sport given advances in science and training. He believes part of the reason is that track and field, particularly field events, does not offer the same financial rewards as other sports, deterring young talent. While proud of his achievement, which only seven other men have come within 29cm of, he reflects on its remarkable longevity.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and primates and are not evolved from older genes. These novel genes are believed to play a key role in advanced human traits like cognitive ability but may also act as "dormant bombs" that fuel cancer. The research, published in Cell Genomics, found that the expression of these genes was significantly higher in tumors. Furthermore, the study showed that deleting some of these specific genes could inhibit the growth of tumor cells, opening new avenues for understanding cancer.</p>
