          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden was 29 and serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk by Japanese forces, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crewmates. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Through modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis of remains exhumed in 2018, Bowden was officially accounted for, and his family has been notified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at UCLA have found that a new treatment strategy significantly delays the progression of recurrent prostate cancer. The study combined a targeted radioactive drug with standard stereotactic body radiation therapy for men whose cancer had returned in a few isolated spots. Results presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology meeting showed this combination more than doubled the time patients remained disease-free, from seven months to nearly eighteen months. A key benefit of this approach is its potential to delay the need for hormone therapy, which often carries burdensome side effects for patients.</p>

          <p>Mariah Carey has revealed the existence of a duet she recorded with Michael Jackson, but its release is currently prevented by his estate. Carey described the track as a reinterpretation of one of Jackson's classic songs, for which she recorded new vocals. She expressed her disappointment that the song could not be included on her latest album, stating that the estate is holding it for a future, larger project. The singer conveyed her excitement for the collaboration, noting that everyone she has played the unreleased track for has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the duet.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have created significant savings for homebuyers, particularly for substantial loans. For a $700,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351. This is about $273 less per month compared to the 6.93% average rate seen in January, translating to over $3,200 in annual savings. Over the full 30-year term of the loan, this rate difference could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments, highlighting the financial impact of recent market shifts.

          <p>After facing nearly a year of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, Marissa Chase sought help from a fertility clinic and was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The condition, which affects about one in ten women of reproductive age, is a leading but often underdiagnosed cause of infertility because it can prevent regular ovulation. With treatment, Chase was able to have two children and is now sharing her story to raise awareness and encourage others experiencing similar difficulties to seek medical advice. Her journey highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for managing the condition effectively.</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, surged over 20% after the company announced a new pricing model that will allow it to license credit scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, which saw their stock prices fall following the news. Fair Isaac stated the move is designed to eliminate unnecessary markups on FICO scores and give lenders more choice. The new plan offers two pricing models and is seen by analysts as a strategic move to improve FICO's own economics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla reported delivering 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. This rise in sales was partly attributed to a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to secure a federal EV tax credit before its expiration. However, the company's vehicle production for the quarter saw a slight decline from the previous year, down to 447,450 units. The sales growth was also tempered by a continuing slump in Europe, where Tesla faces increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activism.

It is crucial to strategically compare offers from online lenders, traditional banks, and credit unions, as interest rates can vary significantly.

This object, named Cha 1107-7626, is five to ten times the mass of Jupiter and is growing through a process called accretion. The intensity of this growth spurt, along with the detection of magnetic activity and water vapor typically associated with star formation, blurs the conventional line between planets and stars. The discovery offers new insights into how planetary-mass objects can form and evolve in the universe.</p>
