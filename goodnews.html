          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the COVID-19 vaccine would be removed from the childhood immunization schedule; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contradicted this policy. The CDC continues to advise that children may receive COVID shots, creating a conflict between the health secretary's policy and the agency's recommendations. This divergence highlights ongoing debates and differing perspectives on COVID-19 vaccination for children.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a special government employee, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with President Trump praising his efforts. While Musk promised to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, DOGE achieved roughly $170 billion in savings, although some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work and predicted it would achieve its $1 trillion goal over time. He also publicly disagreed with Trump's domestic policy package, stating it increases the budget deficit and undermines DOGE's work.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Elon Musk is "not really leaving" the administration despite the end of his 130-day tenure as a special government employee. During an Oval Office news conference, both Trump and Musk defended the work of DOGE, emphasizing that it would continue. Trump credited Musk with leading a sweeping government reform program and changing the mindsets of federal officials to detect fraud and reduce waste. Musk insisted that DOGE would continue to seek $1 trillion in reductions, even as he expressed disappointment in Trump's "big, beautiful" bill.</p>
