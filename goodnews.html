          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that both Thailand and Cambodia are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly border clashes. During a visit to Scotland, Trump announced on social media that he had spoken with leaders from both nations, suggesting peace was a "natural" outcome. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the Preah Vihear temple, has recently intensified, resulting in at least 33 deaths and displacing over 130,000 people. While officials from the involved countries have not confirmed Trump's direct role, they have expressed willingness to engage in dialogue to de-escalate the violence.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha revealed that the success and influence of England's Lionesses in women's soccer made this the right time to revisit the characters. The 2002 movie, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is celebrated for inspiring a generation of female athletes. Chadha is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast for the new project.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Wearable Sensor to Monitor Hydration and Help Prevent Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have created a new wearable sensor designed to continuously monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The non-invasive device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the skin to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology aims to provide a simple and effective way for individuals, especially athletes or those with certain medical conditions, to avoid the dangers of dehydration. The developers believe the sensor offers a practical alternative to traditional methods like blood or urine tests and could be crucial in preventing serious health issues like heatstroke.</p>

          <p>India mounted a strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early setback losing two wickets for no runs, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English bowlers. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with former U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss a potential transatlantic trade agreement. Trump has indicated there is a "50-50 chance" of reaching a framework pact, which he claims the EU is eager to secure. EU officials have also suggested a negotiated solution is within reach, potentially involving a broad 15% tariff on EU goods, mirroring a recent U.S.-Japan deal. The meeting comes as the EU has approved counter-tariffs on U.S. goods as a contingency if the high-stakes talks fail. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts agreeing that the right amount depends heavily on the individual. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, and some studies link moderate consumption to health benefits, tolerance varies widely. Factors such as genetics, overall health, and pregnancy can influence how the body reacts to caffeine. Health experts advise people to be mindful of their own body's response, such as anxiety or poor sleep, and to adjust their intake accordingly rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all rule.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic challenges the notion that reading is a strictly indoor pursuit, advocating for the simple pleasures of reading a book outside. Author Bekah Waalkes argues that reading outdoors should be considered a form of play and a practice in sustained attention that can sharpen one's perception of the surrounding natural world. The piece suggests that combining the act of reading with being in nature, whether in a park or a beer garden, enhances both experiences. It frames the activity not as an escape from the world, but as a deeper engagement with it.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant gave him a new lease on life, following a grim terminal diagnosis that was discovered by chance. Christopher Kennedy, a retired Air Force technician, had no symptoms when a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and fatal lung disease. After medications failed and his condition worsened, he received the life-saving transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. Now recovering well, he is back to training therapy dogs, with plans to name his next puppy "Encore" to celebrate his remarkable second chance.</p>
