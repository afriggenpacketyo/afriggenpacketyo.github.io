        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from the career site Indeed suggests that generative artificial intelligence is set to "radically transform" approximately 26% of jobs in the U.S. market. The roles most exposed to this disruption are white-collar positions in sectors like technology and finance, where AI can supplant cognitive reasoning tasks. In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as nursing and construction, are considered more insulated from the current capabilities of gen AI. While some companies have already announced AI-related workforce reductions, experts note the overall impact on the labor market remains limited for now, with most applications augmenting rather than fully automating human roles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend known as "locking in" is gaining popularity among Gen Z, characterized by periods of intense focus on personal goals, often documented on social media platforms like TikTok. This phenomenon, rooted in sports and gaming culture, involves eliminating distractions to achieve self-improvement in areas like fitness, finance, or personal projects. Analysts view it as a reaction against the constant digital stimulation of the pandemic era and a coping mechanism for navigating economic anxieties, such as the rise of AI and a competitive job market. While it reflects a desire for productivity and control, some critics question if this endless cycle of self-improvement comes at the expense of genuine social connection and fun.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has approved a proposal to prohibit the use of terms like "burger," "sausage," or "steak" for marketing plant-based food alternatives. Proponents, primarily from the center-right EPP group, argue this measure prevents consumer confusion and protects Europe's culinary traditions and farmers. However, the move has faced significant backlash from Green party members, consumer protection groups, and major supermarkets, who contend that labels like "veggie burger" are clear and help shoppers navigate their choices. The final decision on whether the ban will be implemented now rests with the EU's heads of state and government.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is scheduled for his arraignment in a Northern Virginia federal court, where he will face charges of lying to Congress and obstruction. During the proceeding, he is expected to be formally informed of the charges and enter a plea, which will likely be not guilty. The hearing will also address the terms of his pre-trial release and may set a date for future motions or a trial. The case is being overseen by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, and will be heard by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, a Biden appointee, in a jurisdiction that has historically been unfavorable to the former president.</p>

The incident occurred on September 14 while Jordan was playing a game at the Caesars Superdome. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office tracked the suspects to Georgia, where Conyers Police apprehended two individuals, while two others remain at large. Investigators have recovered most of the stolen items. In a social media post, Jordan expressed relief that his family, who were not home at the time, was safe.</p>

          <p>England batsman Joe Root has responded to criticism from former Australian players regarding his lack of a century in Test matches played in Australia, stating that such comments will be forgotten in five years. Ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, Root emphasized that his focus is on the team's success rather than personal milestones, though he acknowledged that his scoring heavily would contribute to England's chances of winning. Now free from the burden of captaincy, which he held on the two previous tours, Root feels he has a better understanding of his game for Australian conditions. He expressed excitement about England's different approach this year, particularly the prospect of a potent fast-bowling attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Preordering a book provides a significant and disproportionate benefit to authors, influencing the book's entire launch trajectory. Strong preorder numbers signal to booksellers that a title has high demand, which can lead to better placement in stores and online, as well as larger initial stock orders. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which dramatically increases the likelihood of a book debuting on a bestseller list. This initial success creates a snowball effect, generating more visibility and subsequent sales. This dynamic highlights how early consumer support can be a crucial factor in the competitive publishing landscape.</p>

          <p>As former FBI Director James Comey faces charges of perjury and obstruction, this article provides context on his career and the events leading to his indictment. The charges stem from his 2020 congressional testimony regarding the FBI's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton and Russian election interference. The indictment, which came shortly after public pressure from President Donald Trump, accuses Comey of misleading Congress about authorizing leaks to the media. The case revisits a contentious period, including Comey's controversial handling of the Clinton email probe and his subsequent firing by Trump, which led to the appointment of a special counsel for the Russia investigation.</p>

Speaking at a CNBC summit, Mollick emphasized that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects. He urged business leaders, particularly in human resources, to move beyond theoretical task forces and instead encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT. His primary advice is for individuals and leaders to actively use the technology themselves to understand its capabilities and limitations, arguing that this direct experience is the only way to discover practical applications.</p>

The law aims to alleviate the financial burden on tenants, who often have to purchase these costly appliances themselves on top of paying first month's rent and a security deposit. The new requirement will apply to all new leases starting on or after January 1, 2026.</p>

The style, which flourished in the early 20th century as a reaction against industrial mass production, is finding new relevance today as people seek well-made, authentic, and nature-connected living spaces. The event celebrates both iconic works by architects like Greene and Greene and the more modest, bespoke bungalows that define many of the city's neighborhoods.</p>
