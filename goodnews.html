          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, keeping a lower court's order in place. The ruling upholds an injunction issued by a California judge, who questioned the legality of the administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce, spearheaded by Elon Musk through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The court stated that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration has sought to remake the federal government, resulting in the termination or resignation of tens of thousands of federal workers, but this ruling maintains the pause on these actions, pending further legal proceedings. The Optimism score reflects the stability of the legal process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has praised a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the U.S. steelmaker will remain "controlled by the USA" despite the merger. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump announced Nippon Steel would invest $14 billion in the company, including significant investments in Pittsburgh and other states. He also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, promising no layoffs or outsourcing and a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. The President's support for the deal marks a shift from his previous opposition to the acquisition, and he portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, while also celebrating a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. He declared the tariff increase would further secure the steel industry in the United States. The announcement comes after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect, staying a decision by a US trade court that blocked the president from imposing the duties. The precise relationship between Nippon Steel and US Steel raised questions, even for some of Trump‚Äôs allies, as the president has thrown his full support behind the deal months after opposing it.</p>

The review will recommend the deployment of new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and to control the army's own, future, unmanned weapons. New money for defence will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%.</p>
