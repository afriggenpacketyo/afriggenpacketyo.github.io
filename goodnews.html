          <h2>Amateur Baseball Player's Clever Interference Play Sparks Rules Debate</h2>

          <p>An amateur baseball player for the Duluth Huskies made a highly unusual play by intentionally fielding a ground ball while he was a baserunner to prevent a potential double play. The umpires on the field allowed the play, ruling it a fielder's choice that kept the bases loaded. However, baseball rules experts later clarified that the play was illegal interference, and both the runner and the batter should have been called out. The quick-thinking but ultimately incorrect maneuver did not end up affecting the game's outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain observed the changes to the river towns and landscape he had once known intimately as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its independence. The passage highlights Twain's nostalgic longing for his youth and the profound sense of freedom he associated with his time on the river, a period he considered the happiest of his life.</p>

          <p>In accordance with his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his unfiltered thoughts on politics, society, and personal matters. The work was dictated by Twain over four years and is intentionally non-linear, which he saw as a way to speak freely without the constraints of public opinion or the fear of hurting living individuals. Curators describe it as a highly unconventional and modern-feeling memoir, and its century-long embargo has been hailed as a brilliant, self-devised marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, thanks to a masterful century from captain Shubman Gill.

In response, England's top order crumbled, losing key wickets including Zak Crawley and Joe Root, to end the day at 72-3.

          <p>In a detailed interview, filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, calling it the most significant event in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." He argues that understanding the nation's founding—including its violence, divisions, and the founders' flaws—is essential for navigating today's political polarization. Burns suggests that America is held together by its founding ideas and that by engaging with this complex history, citizens can find optimism and a path toward unity, seeing the present struggles as familiar echoes of the past.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT about how billionaires are taxed reveals that their primary advantage is not necessarily lower rates but the way their income is structured. While the wealthiest pay an average federal income tax rate around 16%, most of their wealth comes from unrealized capital gains on investments, which are not taxed until sold. This enables strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they live off tax-free loans against their assets, a deferral option unavailable to middle-class workers whose wages are taxed immediately.

          <p>The widespread adoption of digital payment systems has given rise to "tipflation," a phenomenon where customers are prompted to tip more frequently and at higher, pre-set percentages. This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, is causing confusion and social pressure, as opting out often requires an awkward extra step in front of service staff. While beneficial for workers' incomes, experts note that this guilt-driven tipping can irritate customers and negatively impact their perception of a business.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has become a viral trend on TikTok, with proponents claiming the drink can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically contains ingredients like coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can meaningfully impact cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can help with hydration, doctors recommend proven stress-reduction methods like quality sleep, exercise, and therapy.</p>
