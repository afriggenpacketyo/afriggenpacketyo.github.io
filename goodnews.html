          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases to Avoid for Better Communication with Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding phrases like "Because I said so" and "Stop crying" to foster better communication. Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, acknowledge children's feelings, and invite problem-solving. The expert emphasizes creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, and responding with empathy and leadership. These shifts in language represent a deeper change in how parenting is viewed, moving from control and criticism to connection and emotional support.

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro weight loss injections will be available through NHS GPs in England, but only for those meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. This phased approach aims to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. Some GP practices are warning patients not meeting the criteria to avoid booking appointments. The treatment includes wrap-around care, like exercise and diet support, but availability will vary by region. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

Despite facing detention and the denial of seeing his newborn child, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. The Chinese government invested heavily in the EV industry, providing subsidies to consumers and carmakers. This long-term planning and government funding allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. China now has a thriving EV start-up sector, driven by fierce competition and a culture of innovation. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

          <h2>NHS Considers Ketamine Clinics for Treatment-Resistant Depression</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian in Scotland is considering setting up a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has previously urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.
