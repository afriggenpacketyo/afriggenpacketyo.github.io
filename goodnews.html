          <p>After being closed due to the Palisades Fire in January, the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend, much to the relief of residents and businesses. The fire had isolated Malibu, impacting local commerce significantly, with businesses like the Malibu Country Mart experiencing a severe downturn in customer traffic. While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, others are hopeful that the reopening will bring much-needed economic recovery to the area. The reopening marks a step toward healing for the community, even as visible reminders of the devastation remain. Optimism is cautiously high as residents anticipate a return to normalcy and a bustling summer season.</p>

          <p>Trygroup Inc., a major Japanese tutoring company, has issued an apology for incorrectly describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, prompting strong criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning, affecting thousands who consumed contaminated seafood near Minamata Bay in Kumamoto Prefecture. The company has taken the lesson video offline and issued a statement correcting the misinformation, emphasizing that the disease is not inherited but caused by mercury exposure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railways in the UK has become the first private operator to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the move as a "watershed moment" to improve services and end 30 years of fragmentation. Rail unions welcomed the takeover, citing the poor reputation of privatized rail services, while the government anticipates savings of up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators. Other services like Southeastern and Eastern are slated for nationalization by the end of 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their canine companions. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, even when accounting for other stressors in the home. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that dogs are highly sensitive to their owners' moods and can pick up on subtle cues of stress, ultimately affecting their well-being. The study highlights the importance of separating work from home life to protect the mental health of both owners and their pets.</p>

The Dodgers' pitching staff, already strained from a recent extra-inning game, faced further challenges as starter Tony Gonsolin struggled with command. With limited bullpen options, Gonsolin's inability to limit damage in the fourth inning proved costly, while Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, going deep into the game.
