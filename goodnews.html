However, the new review identified only about 20 books that needed to be removed pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel.

Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to the rise. The price increase is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and positive regulatory developments are also supporting the market.</p>

          <h2>Teachers and Doctors in England Receive 4% Pay Rise Amid Union Concerns</h2>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise after the government accepted salary recommendations from pay review bodies. Education unions have broadly welcomed the decision but warn of potential budget cuts to schools without extra funding. Health unions have reacted negatively to a smaller rise of 3.6% for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association said the rise for resident doctors was "woefully inadequate" and will ballot them over possible strike action.</p>

          <p>The House Republicans have advanced a multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package that could significantly impact household finances, with sweeping implications for student borrowing, health savings accounts, and car ownership. The bill aims to make President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and includes provisions to raise the SALT deduction limit, increase the child tax credit, and cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits. It also proposes a new savings account for children and a tax deduction for car loan interest, while reducing benefits for student loan borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's attempted dismantling of the Department of Education. Judge Myong Joun, a Biden appointee, blocked the administration from carrying out its reduction-in-force (RIF) and transferring management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the department. The judge ordered all fired federal employees to be reinstated. The ruling is a response to lawsuits challenging the administration's efforts to eliminate bureaucratic bloat at the Education Department.</p>
