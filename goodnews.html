          <p>Former Democratic Representative and NFL player Colin Allred has officially launched his 2026 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas. This sets the stage for a high-profile race, with Allred potentially facing the winner of a contentious Republican primary between incumbent John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton. In his announcement, Allred positioned himself as a candidate focused on lowering costs and combating political corruption. The race is a key target for Democrats aiming to expand their Senate map, though the party has not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.</p>

          <p>Philip Lane, the chief economist for the European Central Bank, has stated that the institution's recent cycle of monetary policy interventions aimed at controlling inflation is now "done." He noted that the primary goal of reducing inflation from its peak back toward the 2% target has been accomplished, with the May rate at 1.9%. While this phase is over, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared to address new economic shocks and ensure price stability in the medium term. Other officials suggested that any future rate adjustments are more likely to be cuts to support Europe's slow growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Huawei has open-sourced two of its Pangu series artificial intelligence models, a strategic move to foster a broader AI ecosystem and expand its international presence despite U.S. sanctions. This strategy aligns with other Chinese tech companies and is expected to encourage the adoption of Huawei's wider range of products, especially its Ascend AI chips. By making the models available for developers to customize, Huawei aims to solidify its position across the entire AI value chain, from hardware to software. Experts note this approach could particularly resonate in price-sensitive developing countries.</p>

          <p>Key opposition figures in Nigeria, including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Labour Party's Peter Obi, have formed a new coalition called the All Democratic Alliance (ADA). The coalition aims to eventually become a political party and challenge President Bola Tinubu's government in the 2027 general election. Proponents cite worsening economic conditions, hunger, and insecurity as the primary motivation for uniting against the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).

          <p>Panelists at the East Tech West conference in Bangkok argued that emerging economies should develop their own "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and address unique cultural and linguistic needs. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's ability to control its own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure, rather than relying on English-centric models from major global companies. Experts suggested that using open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This approach allows countries, particularly in digitally savvy regions like Southeast Asia, to create localized systems that reflect their own languages and priorities.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly offered to refund a "significant" portion of temporary tariffs to major French cognac makers, including Hennessy, Martell, and R√©my Martin. This development comes as Beijing's anti-dumping investigation into European brandy, which is mainly produced in France, nears its conclusion. According to a source, producers must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices to qualify for the refund. The move is seen as an attempt to resolve the trade dispute before the temporary tariffs of up to 39% potentially become permanent after the July 5 deadline.</p>

The 18-month review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds described as confusing and ungenerous compared to other countries. The announcement follows a parliamentary committee report that labeled the UK's system as one of the worst in the developed world.

The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, demonstrated a method that could provide a standardized, high-precision way to conduct global carbon inventories, a capability currently lacking. The researchers stated that their optimized model has significant potential for tracking emissions from various industrial sources, not just power plants.

          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money is needed for retirement, noting that the answer varies significantly based on individual goals and pre-retirement lifestyles. It discusses the challenge for UK government pension policy in setting appropriate savings benchmarks, as targets that are too high can discourage lower earners, while low targets can mislead higher earners. The analysis reviews different adequacy measures, from "pounds and pence" benchmarks like those from the PLSA to relative measures like target replacement rates. It concludes that no single measure is perfect, and individuals must consider their own specific circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while French cinema has been slow to confront the nation's history of slavery and colonialism, a new wave of films is finally addressing these subjects. The author contrasts the historical absence of such stories in French media with the prevalence of American films like "12 Years a Slave." The article highlights recent films like "No Chains No Masters," "Fanon," and "Zion" for their powerful portrayals of enslavement, anti-colonial struggle, and the modern-day legacy of colonialism in French territories. Despite finding audiences, these films struggle for mainstream recognition, suggesting the French establishment is not ready to fully embrace these narratives.</p>
