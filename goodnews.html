          <p>This article summarizes findings from a decade-long study on parenting styles that foster success in children, emphasizing optimism, tailored motivation, and love for learning. The study highlights the importance of instilling a sense of possibility and adapting motivational approaches to match each child's unique interests. It also underscores the value of learning and empowerment through everyday activities, fostering a love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than acting as a coach or critic. The research suggests a shift towards encouraging curiosity and a deep love for learning over sheer hard work. The author, Susan Dominus, emphasizes the significance of supporting children's growth with love and joy, allowing their desires to drive them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the match against Andorra, with coach Thomas Tuchel expected to test an experimental starting lineup. Tuchel is considering deploying Reece James in an unfamiliar left-back position, while Curtis Jones is an option on the right side. Cole Palmer is anticipated to make his debut after a strong training week, and Declan Rice may rest, potentially allowing Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham to play centrally. Saka's omission is likely due to fitness concerns, as he completed only one full training session during the week.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy advises young professionals to explore various career paths to discover their strengths and preferences, rather than feeling pressured to have a defined plan early on. Jassy emphasizes the importance of learning what one doesn't want to do as much as what one does, drawing from his own diverse experiences before joining Amazon. He credits his success to adaptability, reliability, and a strong learning attitude, noting that these qualities are more crucial than excelling at every task.

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family" has overhauled its security protocols following a surge in kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives, opting for a hybrid analog-digital system to safeguard their assets. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, detailed how they've decentralized their holdings by splitting seed phrases, encrypting them, and hiding them across four continents. The family has also abandoned hardware wallets due to security concerns, instead relying on blockchain-based encryption and steel plates. These measures reflect growing concerns about the safety of crypto holders and the need for decentralized security solutions.</p>

          <p>A US Navy warship captain contrasts the Red Sea conflict with the potential challenges of a maritime war with China, emphasizing China's advanced weaponry, surveillance, and intelligence capabilities. The captain describes the Red Sea conflict as a 'knife fight in a phone booth' compared to the longer-distance engagements expected in a China conflict. Lessons learned from the Red Sea, including the performance of the Aegis Combat System and considerations for magazine capacity and rearming, are informing planning for future naval operations. The Navy is working to drive down the cost ratio for air defense missions and improve reloading capabilities.</p>
