          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with net income surpassing expectations while overall revenues fell short of forecasts. A key highlight was the performance of its cloud computing division, which saw revenue grow by 26% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter. This growth is crucial as the company seeks to monetize its significant investments in artificial intelligence. Despite the strong performance in its cloud unit, the company continues to navigate economic uncertainty in China. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the country's top economic planning agency has urged a rational and scientific approach, advising regions to build on their unique strengths to avoid "disorderly competition and blind expansion." To support this rollout, the government plans to offer AI vouchers to subsidize computing power for companies and pilot consumer subsidies for AI-powered products.</p>
