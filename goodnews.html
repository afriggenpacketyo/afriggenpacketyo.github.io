          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 12:19:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos is set to challenge traditional car dealerships by allowing the rental giant to sell its used fleet directly to consumers through Amazon's platform. While Hertz already sells vehicles directly, leveraging Amazon's vast e-commerce infrastructure could significantly amplify its reach and sales volume. Industry analysts worry that because rental companies can purchase cars in bulk at a discount, they can resell them at prices that traditional dealerships cannot match, potentially disrupting a major profit source for dealers.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure revealed that a filmmaker's suggestion to digitally alter her neck for a movie flashback scene negatively impacted her mental health, sending her "back to therapy." In a recent podcast episode, the 49-year-old star discussed the immense pressure to maintain a youthful appearance in Hollywood, contrasting it with fan appreciation for her aging naturally. While she has not used Botox or fillers, Bure admitted she is considering them due to the industry standard set by her peers and the visual disparity in how male and female actors age on screen.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced confidence in Nike's long-term recovery, anticipating that once the company clears its excess inventory, new product introductions under CEO Elliot Hill will drive significant growth. He characterized his investment as a longer-term play on the company's turnaround rather than a bet on the upcoming quarterly report. Additionally, Cramer described Costco's recent stock decline as an "absurd" situation, presenting a rare opportunity to buy shares in the retail giant at a valuation below 50 times earnings, which he considers a bargain.

          <p>This article outlines key pitfalls to avoid during debt repayment to ensure long-term financial stability. It advises against using predatory debt relief services, tapping into retirement funds which incurs penalties and sacrifices future growth, and ignoring smaller debts while focusing only on large ones. Additionally, it cautions against over-relying on balance transfer cards without a clear payoff plan and neglecting to build at least a small emergency fund, as unexpected expenses can derail progress and force a return to borrowing.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, announced that maintenance grants will be reinstated for some university students in England by 2029, a decade after they were abolished. The non-repayable grants will be targeted at tens of thousands of students from lower-income households who are enrolled in "priority courses" aligned with the country's industrial strategy. The new program is set to be funded by a tax levied on international student fees, a move that has drawn criticism from university representative bodies who argue it unfairly burdens international students.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is strengthening in the Atlantic and is forecast to reach hurricane status on Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, where a tropical storm warning is in effect. However, forecast maps show Imelda is expected to turn east-northeastward, moving away from the southeastern U.S. coast. Despite its trajectory away from the mainland, swells from the storm will still contribute to life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast this week.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has officially listed the Bishnoi gang, a transnational criminal organization operating from India, as a terrorist entity. This designation allows authorities to freeze the group's assets and prosecute offenses such as financing and recruitment. The move comes after Canadian police alleged that Indian government agents were using the gang to carry out violence and extortion against diaspora communities, particularly targeting supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement. The action is intended to provide law enforcement with more effective tools to combat the group's intimidation tactics in Canada.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Argentina have announced the discovery of a new dinosaur species, named Joaquinraptor, which lived approximately 70 million years ago. The fossil, found in Patagonia, belongs to the megaraptoran group, known for their large claws and powerful forelimbs. This particular specimen was about 23 feet long and weighed over 2,000 pounds, and interestingly, was found with a crocodile's arm bone in its mouth, offering a rare glimpse into its diet. The discovery adds to the rich fossil record of the region and provides new insights into the ecosystems of the late Cretaceous Period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the early Premier League season suggests that none of the top title contenders—Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea—are without significant weaknesses. Liverpool has appeared defensively vulnerable despite their wins, while Arsenal has shown a concerning tendency to struggle with adversity. Manchester City is still finding its form under a new tactical approach, and Chelsea seems far from a cohesive title-challenging unit. While it is still early, the weekend's results highlighted these emerging patterns, indicating that the race for the title may be defined by which team can resolve its flaws most effectively.</p>

          <p>Moldova's ruling pro-European Action and Solidarity (PAS) party has won a clear victory in the country's parliamentary election, securing over 50% of the vote and defying polls that predicted a tighter race. The result is being interpreted as a resounding rejection of Russian influence and a strong mandate for the country's continued path toward the European Union. The pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc received a much lower-than-expected 24% of the vote, marking a significant political defeat for the Kremlin despite its extensive pro-Russian disinformation campaigns in the country.</p>
