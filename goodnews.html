          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon title in a remarkably one-sided final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This "double bagel" victory marks the first time a woman has won the Wimbledon final without conceding a game since 1911. For the 24-year-old Polish star, this is her sixth Grand Slam title, maintaining a perfect record in major finals. Anisimova, appearing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves, committing numerous unforced errors throughout the match.</p>

          <p>In a swift 57-minute match, Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship by defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0. The article provides deep context on both players, noting Swiatek's previous Grand Slam wins on other surfaces and a past doping ban from a contaminated supplement. It also highlights Anisimova's remarkable journey to the final, including her 2023 career break for mental health and her stunning semifinal victory over the world's number one player. Despite the loss, Anisimova is set to break into the top 10 rankings for the first time.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for approximately 883 loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" due to the presence of undeclared hazelnuts. The recall, announced via the FDA, warns that individuals with a nut allergy face a risk of serious or life-threatening reactions. The affected products were distributed to retailers like Kroger and Walmart across 12 states, including Illinois, Ohio, and Tennessee. While no major injuries have been reported, the company is removing all affected lots from shelves and offering full refunds to consumers.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called up to the British and Irish Lions squad for their tour in Australia. The move comes after fellow hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie suffered a suspected concussion during a match against the AUNZ Invitational XV, making him a doubt for the first Test against Australia. George, a two-time Lions tourist, was in Argentina preparing for an England match but will now join the Lions in Brisbane. His Saracens teammate, Theo Dan, will replace him in England's starting lineup for their upcoming game.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons smuggling charges. Macias, head of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His escape and the subsequent government crackdown highlighted the deep influence of drug cartels in the country. Macias's agreement marks a significant moment, as he is set to become the first Ecuadorian citizen extradited under a new law aimed at combating organized crime.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified the U.S. states with the strongest economies, positioning them to better withstand a potential recession. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina ranked as the top three, respectively, based on factors like GDP growth, job creation, fiscal health, and insulation from trade wars and federal budget cuts. The study considered how reliant each state is on international trade, particularly with China, and on federal government spending. States like South Carolina and Utah were noted for strong growth but also higher vulnerability to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs and trade war uncertainty, businesses are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. FTZs allow companies to import components duty-free, assemble them, and only pay tariffs when the final product enters U.S. commerce, which helps preserve cash flow. However, a recent executive order by President Trump eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product. This change has increased costs for some manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

The regulator, Ofcom, will enforce age verification measures, with non-compliant companies facing heavy fines. However, critics and even government sources acknowledge the rules may already be outdated, as they do not fully address risks from AI chatbots or in-app purchases. The government is already considering further measures to address addictive algorithms and screen time as technology continues to evolve.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, have successfully used genetic genealogy to solve a cold case from 1997 involving the sexual assault of a nine-year-old boy. The assailant, identified only as John Doe #147, remained at large for nearly three decades. With the help of researcher Barbara Rae-Venter, a pioneer in the field, prosecutors were able to build a family tree using DNA evidence, ultimately leading them to the perpetrator. This breakthrough showcases the growing power of genetic genealogy as a crucial tool for resolving long-unsolved violent crimes.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program officially targets a 2027 crewed landing, it faces significant technical challenges, such as the need for in-orbit refueling.
