          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the European Union is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing high-tech products like smartphones and electric vehicles. The move is a response to recent export license requirements and curbs imposed by Beijing, which the EU claims have damaged European industries. Von der Leyen emphasized that while short-term solutions with China are being explored, the EU is prepared to use all available tools to respond. The long-term strategy involves boosting recycling, forming partnerships with other producer nations, and achieving greater material independence.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological healing, inspiring global conservation efforts. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the restored riverbanks. The restoration was marked by a historic 310-mile kayak journey by Indigenous youth, who were the first to navigate the full length of the free-flowing river in more than 100 years. This successful project now serves as a powerful model for Indigenous-led environmental movements worldwide, demonstrating that large-scale river restoration is achievable.</p>

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest and most storied residences, renowned for its unique architecture and historical significance. The home briefly served as the executive mansion for President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned by the British in 1814; it was here that Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812. Over its 200-year history, the house has also gained a reputation for being haunted, with numerous reports of unexplained phenomena like flickering lights and the scent of lilacs, Dolley Madison's favorite flower. The building is now a museum undergoing renovations for America's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a comfortable 26-6 victory over England at Wembley in the first Rugby League Ashes match in 22 years, continuing their historical dominance in the rivalry. Despite a hard-fought effort from England, the Australian Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half. Full-back Reece Walsh was the standout player, scoring the opening try and adding another later in the game to seal the win. England's only score was a late consolation try from Daryl Clark. The loss puts England in a difficult position as they seek their first Ashes series triumph in 55 years, with the second Test scheduled for next week in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly, a left-wing independent lawmaker, is poised to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While votes were still being counted, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms. The role of president in Ireland is largely ceremonial, but Connolly's victory is seen as a significant moment for the country's left-leaning parties, who backed her candidacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, humorously dubbed 'VOO and chill,' is reportedly losing its appeal among some investors. Financial experts suggest that the S&P 500 has become imbalanced, with the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index, which reduces diversification. In contrast, defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities are at an all-time low weighting. Consequently, traders are showing renewed interest in other areas of the market, particularly small-cap stocks, as tracked by the Russell 2000 index, which recently hit an all-time high and has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past six months.

This portrayal underscores the highly centralized nature of power under Xi, who has placed his personal stamp on the nation's key economic and social blueprint.

          <p>In a new interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating that her career in public service is "not done." While not officially confirming a decision, she dismissed current polls that show her with low support, noting that she has defied polling expectations throughout her political career. In the interview, Harris also sharply criticized Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" with "thin skin" who has weaponized the justice system and pressured business leaders to capitulate to his demands.

This incident sheds light on the booming sleep-tech industry, now valued at over $29 billion, which offers everything from smart eye masks to neurotech headbands. While some technologies can help those with medical conditions like PTSD, the increasing reliance on complex gadgets for a basic biological function introduces new points of failure into the quest for a good night's sleep.</p>

Bezos originally purchased the Hunts Point property for $37.5 million in 2019, realizing a profit of over $25 million from the sale. This major real estate transaction comes as Bezos continues to divest his holdings in Amazon, with his ownership stake in the company now falling below 10%.

          <p>A certified child life specialist advises that setting boundaries for children should involve more than just the word "no." To foster connection rather than conflict, parents should turn "no" into a teachable moment by explaining the reasoning behind the limit, especially concerning safety and kindness. Offering children choices within established boundaries helps them feel a sense of autonomy and control, making them more likely to cooperate. The expert also stresses the importance of consistency in enforcing rules and repairing the relationship with an explanation or apology after an instinctive, emotional reaction, which teaches accountability and empathy.</p>

This fosters resilience and self-starting traits that are valuable in adulthood.
