          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:44:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Ellison's newly formed Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that could create a media giant. While no formal offer has been made, news of the potential bid caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge nearly 30%. Acquiring WBD would give Paramount access to a massive library of valuable franchises, including DC superheroes, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, in addition to significant sports broadcasting rights. This consolidation would dramatically expand Paramount's content arsenal to better compete in the streaming and theatrical markets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident when his ball was apparently stolen by spectators after an errant tee shot. The event occurred just before play was suspended due to weather. Because the ball could not be found, Fitzpatrick was allowed a penalty drop when play resumed, a situation he believes was more advantageous than playing his provisional ball. He ultimately scored a six-under-par 66, suggesting the unusual circumstance may have inadvertently helped his performance.</p>

          <p>Adobe announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed analyst predictions, with both revenue and earnings per share beating estimates. The design software company reported revenue of $5.99 billion, an 11% increase from the previous year, driven by strong performance in its digital media business. Following the positive report, Adobe provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, projecting continued growth that also topped market expectations.

          <p>Manchester United's goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has officially joined Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the rest of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the closing of the Turkish transfer window. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan in 2023 for £47.2 million, had not featured in United's first three Premier League matches this season. His only appearance was in a Carabao Cup game, prompting the move to secure more consistent playing time.</p>

Among those interviewed are former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. The meetings are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to not only select a successor to Jerome Powell but also to implement a reform agenda for the central bank. This agenda includes reducing the Fed's large bond portfolio and diminishing its overall economic footprint.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Fall to Lowest Level in Nearly a Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:12:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average mortgage rates for 30-year terms have dropped to 6.35%, their lowest point in almost a year, creating a potentially favorable window for homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance. This decline is largely attributed to market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate, along with a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential borrowers to assess their financial situations and consider whether to act now or wait for potentially lower rates, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has outlined the financial structure of a new deal where Japan will invest $550 billion into U.S.-based projects. According to the agreement, the U.S. and Japan will split the profits from these projects evenly until Japan's initial investment is fully paid back. After that point, the profit-sharing model will shift dramatically, with the United States receiving 90% and Japan receiving 10%.

          <p>A debate is unfolding in Germany over the content of the nation's high school curriculum, with a growing movement advocating for a shift away from classic literary works by authors like Goethe. Proponents of reform, including student representatives, argue that the current reading lists are dominated by historical male authors and are not relevant to the diverse student population of today. They call for the inclusion of more contemporary books by female and minority authors to better engage young people and reflect modern society.</p>

Jackson later expressed regret for his actions, stating his emotions got the best of him in the moment.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has experienced a surprising commercial success with its latest product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras. The palm-sized cameras, sold in blind-box packaging, sold out almost immediately upon release, striking a chord with consumers drawn to vintage aesthetics. This success provides a positive development for Kodak, a company that has recently faced significant financial struggles. The product's popularity highlights a growing Gen Z trend for nostalgic, pre-digital technology, which the company has successfully capitalized on.</p>
