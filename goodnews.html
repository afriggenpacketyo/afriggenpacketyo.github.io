          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard filed a lawsuit arguing the revocation was a violation of the First Amendment and retaliation for rejecting government demands regarding governance and curriculum. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the move was due to Harvard fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. The university's president condemned the action, warning of the impact on international students and scholars across the country.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a significant choreographer of the 20th century and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98. He was best known for his 1968 production of "Spartacus," which was a turning point in Soviet ballet, streamlined and simplified compared to earlier productions. Grigorovich's choreography departed from the dominant style of Soviet ballet, dramatic ballet, by emphasizing dancing and athletic spectacle. He also created ballets such as "Ivan the Terrible," which were popular nearly everywhere.</p>

          <p>Dave Nadig, an ETF expert, predicts the ETF market will soon see a massive influx of new products, potentially doubling from 4,000 to over 7,000 due to SEC rule changes allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes. This surge will create challenges for investors and advisors in navigating the expanded market. While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, Nadig advises caution with new, complex strategies, noting that some, like private credit ETFs, have seen limited demand. He suggests investors carefully evaluate the structure and capacity constraints of ETFs, especially those in illiquid markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet reveals that contrast-enhanced mammography identifies three times as many invasive cancers as ultrasound in women with dense breast tissue, which often obscures tumors in standard mammograms. The study found that contrast-enhanced mammography detects smaller tumors than regular mammography, though MRI scans are slightly better at detecting more tumors overall. Contrast-enhanced mammography involves using an iodine-based dye to highlight tumors. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become the standard of care for high-risk women with dense breasts, though its use for screening has not been approved by the FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily allowing President Trump to fire officials protected from summary termination, but the order included language suggesting the Court will not permit Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve. While the Republican justices have signaled a willingness to grant the president broad authority over independent agencies, this order indicates a limit to that authority when it comes to the Fed. The Court's explanation for treating Federal Reserve leaders differently is complex and likely to reassure investors that the Fed's ability to make decisions about interest rates will not be disrupted.</p>
