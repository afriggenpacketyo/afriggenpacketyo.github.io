          <p>Amid rising economic concerns fueled by tariffs and inflation, a significant majority of Americans are considering cutting back on non-essential spending. Popular money-saving trends like "no buy," "low buy," and "slow buy" are gaining traction on social media, particularly among young adults. These challenges aim to break overspending habits and promote mindful purchasing decisions. Financial experts emphasize the importance of long-term financial habits over short-term trends, advising individuals to focus on their own financial goals and avoid being swayed by social media influences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved three new color additives from natural sources for use in food manufacturing, driven by growing health concerns surrounding artificial food dyes. These approvals include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, with expanded uses across various food and beverage products. The move follows calls from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for companies to phase out petroleum-based dyes and a West Virginia law banning seven artificial food dyes. While the FDA is not imposing an outright ban, it is accelerating the review and approval process for natural color alternatives.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Nvidia's primary chip supplier, reported strong April sales, indicating a continued ramp-up in AI infrastructure. The sales figures were up 22.2% month-over-month and 48.1% year-over-year, though it remains unclear if tariff concerns impacted these figures. Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of its H20 AI chips for China to comply with U.S. export restrictions, but it is uncertain how these chips will compete with local alternatives. The broader market is experiencing a pause after a historic comeback, with upcoming inflation data and retail sales figures providing further insights into the economy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Vermont has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, from ICE custody on bail. Ozturk's visa was revoked by the Trump administration, and her lawyers argued that she was targeted due to a column she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ozturk testified about her humanitarian work and involvement in school groups, and her lawyers raised concerns about her health and the conditions at the detention facility.

The discovery was made after four years of searching, with parts of the ship, including the winch and iron components, found on the seabed of Guichen Bay. The Australian National Maritime Museum and the Silentworld Foundation collaborated on the project, with future monitoring planned to uncover more of the ship's history.

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt ruling. The game was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees. The recent ruling prohibits Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject the submission, but the outcome has already shifted the economics of app development for iPhones, with other developers updating their apps to avoid Apple's fees.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges women face in balancing personal desires with societal expectations, drawing on Mavis Gallant's stories and the concept of being "perfectly free." While women today have more choices than in Gallant's era, achieving complete independence can still mean sacrificing traditional attachments such as marriage, children, and a steady career. The author questions whether attaining total independence is attainable for all women. The piece discusses the balance of multiple kinds of fulfillment may find that dedicating themselves to one over the other is less simple than it was decades ago.</p>
