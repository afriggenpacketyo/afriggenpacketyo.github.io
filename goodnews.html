          <p>The Israeli military fired warning shots at a group of diplomats, including Japanese officials, in the occupied West Bank, prompting a formal protest from Japan. According to the Israeli troops, the shots were fired after the diplomats entered a restricted area in Jenin while assessing the humanitarian situation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed regret and demanded an explanation and measures to prevent similar incidents, while the Israeli military stated that it regrets the incident and will report its findings to the concerned nations. The group consisted of diplomats from over 30 countries, visiting the city to assess the humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Shares of Xpeng, the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong following positive earnings reports and an optimistic revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts anticipate that Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled compared to the previous year, fueled by robust sales figures, and its net loss narrowed substantially. This financial performance has led brokerages to maintain a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers mounted an improbable comeback, overcoming a double-digit fourth-quarter lead to defeat the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers fueled the Pacers' rally, while Tyrese Haliburton hit a game-tying shot to send the game into overtime. Despite a strong performance from Jalen Brunson, the Knicks ultimately fell short as Obi Toppin's late dunk secured the victory for Indiana. The Pacers' win marks a rare occurrence, as teams leading by nine or more points in the final minute of a playoff game had been undefeated since 1998.</p>

          <p>One year after winning the general election, the Labour government is attempting to deflect criticism by blaming the Conservatives for current challenges. Government sources are highlighting issues such as the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review as examples of Conservative failures. Labour claims the previous government did not adequately address these issues, leading to current problems. The strategy raises questions about the effectiveness of continually criticizing the predecessor government as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office.</p>

          <p>India's trade negotiations with the United States have become more complex after President Trump demanded that Apple move production back to the U.S., despite the company's shift towards manufacturing in India. This demand creates a challenge for India, which has been working to attract businesses seeking to reduce reliance on China. Despite the challenges, Indian officials are hopeful for a trade agreement, viewing it as a series of tranches. The article highlights the factors that have made India competitive in manufacturing, including government support and lower labor costs.</p>

The subsidy provides a fixed sum to wholesalers, regardless of current prices, which have recently fallen below the previous benchmark. The program aims to reduce wholesale gasoline prices by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned weekly until mid-June.</p>
