          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with China's Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, during a recent visit to Beijing, signaling ongoing high-level engagement between the tech giant and the Chinese government. During his trip, Huang also met with other senior officials and praised Chinese firms' "world class" AI models. He noted high demand for Nvidia's H20 AI chip, which is designed to comply with U.S. export controls, though sales are pending U.S. government approval. The discussions occur as Nvidia navigates complex U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China while trying to maintain its presence in the critical market.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June as Rice Prices Cool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs could reintroduce inflationary pressures. The economic data arrives amid concerns over slowing growth and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>German Chancellor Acknowledges Past European Defense Underfunding Amid US Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:29:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically underfunded their own defense, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview, Merz stated that his government understands the U.S. demand for Europe to contribute more and is now increasing its defense spending in response to the threat posed by Russia. Despite past tensions and President Trump's tariff threats, Merz indicated that he and Trump are now "on the same page" regarding the war in Ukraine and are coordinating efforts. This signals a pragmatic shift in German policy aimed at strengthening European security.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, a design that enhances its operational flexibility. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. The design allows for high-speed flight comparable to fixed-wing models but eliminates the need for a runway, making it ideal for deployment in rugged or remote areas. This new technology showcases China's advancements in unmanned aerial systems and its focus on developing sophisticated military capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Confirms First Use of Generative AI for Visual Effects in Original Series</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:55:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity and make advanced effects accessible for productions with smaller budgets, stating it was not just about cutting costs. The move is significant as the use of AI in entertainment is highly controversial and was a central issue in the 2023 Hollywood strikes. Sarandos claimed the AI-generated sequence was completed ten times faster than with traditional methods.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a common and benign vein condition, particularly for individuals over 70, and stated that tests ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement aims to address public speculation fueled by images showing Trump with swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter of which was attributed to frequent handshaking. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:52:00 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to "REAL Cane Sugar" in its soda, a move he framed as a victory for taste and health. This article analyzes the announcement, noting that while Mexican Coke made with cane sugar has a cult following, the health benefits are negligible as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The author suggests the move is a political gesture, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement but having little substantive impact on public health. It's seen as a way for Trump to score an easy political win amid other, more complex controversies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size limit "may be the next big announcement." This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners in airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially easing passenger inconvenience.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, as female members of Congress from both parties played together on a single team. The game, which pits "Team Congress" against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the event sets aside political divisions to focus on a common cause. Participants emphasized the positive experience of coming together as women to support a cause that has personally affected many of them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 1.5-million-year-old ice core, the oldest ever retrieved, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Scientists will carefully melt the ice to study the ancient dust, ash, and air bubbles trapped within, which hold vital information about Earth's climate history. This research aims to unlock secrets about a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's ice age cycles suddenly changed. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
