          <p>Economists anticipate a cooling in hiring for May, with expectations set at a gain of 125,000 nonfarm payrolls, a decrease from April's 177,000. This potential slowdown is attributed to companies and consumers bracing for higher tariffs and economic uncertainty. The report's significance lies in its potential to influence Federal Reserve policy, as a substantial dip could prompt quicker interest rate action. The article highlights conflicting data, with sentiment indicators suggesting flagging optimism due to tariff worries and recent ADP data showing minimal private payroll growth.
