        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As bankruptcy filings rise amid economic pressures, it is crucial for individuals to understand the factors that could disqualify them from seeking this form of debt relief. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, disqualifiers include failing the income-based means test, having a recent bankruptcy discharge, and failing to complete mandatory credit counseling. Fraudulent behavior, such as concealing assets or lying on forms, will also lead to rejection and potential criminal charges. If disqualified, alternative options for managing debt include debt consolidation loans, negotiating debt settlements with creditors, or enrolling in a formal debt management program with a credit counseling agency.

          <p>Investments in artificial intelligence are significantly boosting the digital advertising businesses of tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, both of which reported strong quarterly sales that surpassed expectations. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, credited AI with improving the efficiency of the company's ad system, contributing to a 22% year-over-year sales increase. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap's growth hampered by a botched ad platform update. The trend suggests that during times of economic uncertainty, advertisers are gravitating toward the larger, more stable platforms whose AI-driven tools offer more reliable returns.

          <p>Gold futures pulled back from a record high after the White House announced it would issue an executive order to clarify "misinformation" regarding tariffs on gold bullion. The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association raised concerns that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss exports was being applied to 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars, potentially disrupting the international flow of physical gold. Following the White House statement, gold prices fell from an all-time closing high of over $3,491 per ounce, settling lower. The clarification is expected to address whether these specific gold products are exempt from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The permit, valid until 2026, formalizes the limited robotaxi service the company has been running for select riders in Austin since June. The current fleet uses Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor present, but the new state permit does not require one. This development marks a significant step for Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions, though it comes amid federal scrutiny of its technology following several reported traffic violations.</p>

          <p>Disney and actress Gina Carano have settled a lawsuit she filed alleging wrongful termination and discrimination after being fired from the series 'The Mandalorian.' Carano, who was dismissed in 2021 over controversial social media posts, had sought over $75,000 in damages and reinstatement, with her legal fees funded by Elon Musk. In a statement, Carano called the settlement the "best outcome for all parties involved." A Lucasfilm spokesperson confirmed the resolution and stated the company looked forward to identifying future opportunities to work with Carano, noting she was always well-respected by her colleagues on set.</p>

          <h2>Chelsea and Striker Nicolas Jackson Mutually Agree He Can Leave the Club</h2>

          <p>Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson and the club have mutually agreed that he can pursue a transfer, with the 24-year-old training alone amid interest from Newcastle. The decision suits both parties, as Chelsea has reinforced its attack by signing two new strikers, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The club reportedly hopes to receive a transfer fee of at least double the £32 million they paid for the Senegal international in 2023. If Chelsea's valuation is not met, the plan is to reintegrate Jackson back into the squad, where he has scored 30 goals in 80 matches.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant weekly gain, rising about 13% after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing investor fears over potential tariffs from the Trump administration. This reversal of fortune has pushed the stock to its highest level since April. In other market news, The Wall Street Journal reports the Trump administration is planning a historic stock offering for government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The potential deal, which could value the companies at over $500 billion, is being discussed with leaders of major banks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is unlikely to derail long-delayed free trade negotiations between the EU and India, according to experts. The EU's move targets Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, as part of its effort to cut funding for the war in Ukraine. However, analysts argue the designation is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from the U.S. threat of high tariffs. This American pressure may paradoxically increase India's desire to secure a stable trade agreement with the EU, strengthening Brussels' negotiating position.</p>

The new store will honor the brand's legacy by accepting old 20% off coupons, regardless of their expiration date.

          <h2>England Cricketer Chris Woakes Considers Rehab Over Surgery to Be Fit for Ashes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 13:20:07 EDT</div>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes is considering forgoing surgery on his injured shoulder in favor of rehabilitation to ensure his fitness for the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. The 36-year-old suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder during the recent Test against India but still bravely came out to bat in a sling during England's narrow run chase. While surgery would likely mean a three-to-four-month recovery that clashes with the Ashes timeline, a rehab-focused approach could have him ready in about eight weeks. Woakes stated that avoiding surgery could be a risk he is willing to take for the team.</p>
