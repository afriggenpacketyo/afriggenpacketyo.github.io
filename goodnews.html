          <p>A privately-built Japanese moon lander, the Resilience, is positioned for a landing attempt near the center of Mare Frigoris, with the mission marking the second attempt by ispace to achieve a lunar touchdown. The lander carries cameras, scientific instruments, and a tiny rover called Tenacious, which will explore the lunar surface and deploy a customer payload consisting of a small model of a Swedish house. The project aims to provide non-government transportation services to the moon, however, previous attempts by ispace and other companies have faced challenges. Only one company, Firefly Aerospace, has successfully touched down and carried out its mission prior to this attempt.</p>

          <p>The original Herm√®s Birkin bag, inspired by the late Jane Birkin, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's this summer, with the bag differing slightly from the models sold today. Birkin, known for her artistry and style, inspired the bag's creation after complaining to then-Herm√®s head Jean-Louis Dumas about the lack of suitable bags for daily use. The bag is part of Sotheby's Fashion Icons auction, and will be on display in New York before the Paris auction. Herm√®s artistic director Pierre-Alexis Dumas has said the company's leather goods are costly due to the uncompromising quality and craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent travel ban has raised concerns about its potential impact on international sporting events, however, the proclamation said exemptions could be made for athletes and coaches participating in ‚Äúmajor‚Äù competitions in the United States. The ban, which affects nationals from several countries, has already drawn criticism and could face legal challenges. The inclusion of exemptions for athletes aims to mitigate disruptions to events like the World Cup and the Olympics. The situation remains fluid, and further clarifications may be needed to fully understand the scope of the exemptions.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone, claiming they discussed and agreed to a trade deal, however, this follows accusations from Trump that China violated a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates. Trump said the call resulted in a positive conclusion for both countries, and that negotiating teams will meet soon, while Xi invited Trump to visit China. China has pushed back on U.S. accusations, citing concerns about restrictions on tech exports and student visas. Trump believes the call resolved complexities regarding rare earths and magnets.</p>

          <p>Brock Heger, a 25-year-old from California, has transitioned from driving tractors on his family's farm to becoming a top off-road racer, recently winning his category at the Dakar Rally.

He was a last-minute entrant to the Dakar Rally, finishing on his 25th birthday, with his father, Joe Heger, being his biggest fan.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income, potentially benefiting 500,000 more pupils. The changes aim to save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty, however, the Conservative party claims the policy would mean less money for schools' budgets. While Sir Keir Starmer called the measure a "down payment" on child poverty, he declined to scrap the two-child benefit cap, emphasizing the importance of focusing on attainment and cost of living. The government has set aside ¬£1bn to fund the change up to 2029, and will review standards so that school meals are healthy.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its popular V-8 Hemi engine for its Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision made last year amid tightening fuel economy regulations, with Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitting the cancellation was a mistake. The Hemi will be a $1,200 option on most models, while the more efficient Hurricane engine will also continue to be offered, with Kuniskis expecting Hemi to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. This announcement is part of a new product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over an 18-month period, and marks the latest reversal in automakers' plans amid slower-than-expected EV adoption.
