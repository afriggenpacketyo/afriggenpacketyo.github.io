          <p>The UK is experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber heat-health alert for England, which will remain in force until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters are also deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires, with a 717% surge compared to the same period in 2024, urging the public to be careful with barbecues and flammable objects. The heatwave is expected to continue, but some relief is anticipated on Sunday, with cooler air gradually sweeping in from the west. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are launching "trial living" schemes to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The initiative offers free stays for up to four weeks, aiming to encourage long-term relocation by highlighting affordable accommodation, reduced traffic, and a strong sense of community. Guben, one of the participating cities, has seen some success, with a portion of participants choosing to move there permanently, leading to similar projects in nearby towns. The effort is a response to significant demographic changes since German reunification, including declining birth rates, emigration of young people, and an aging population, as the city seeks to fill job vacancies and revitalize its economy. The project aims to create a welcoming culture and social interaction to encourage more people to settle in the city long-term. </p>

A joint venture was launched between companies from Japan, Britain, and Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet by 2035. A Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurant in Lima was named the world's best, recognizing the blending of Japanese techniques with Peruvian ingredients. Japanese restaurants and food companies are switching to noodles from rice due to rising rice prices, and regions are benefiting from Japan's anime and manga soft power reach, boosting local economies. The U.S. reportedly asked Japan to raise defense spending to 3.5% of GDP. </p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, who spent months in custody as the Trump administration attempted to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after leaving the facility, stating that the administration chose the wrong person to target. A judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child while he was in custody. </p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation to ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons, sending the bill to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports such a ban. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions, though this bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and will only punish law-abiding citizens, while some gun control advocates have described the proposed law as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country". The Supreme Court may soon take up the issue, with some justices indicating skepticism about the constitutionality of such bans. </p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, with a federal judge ruling he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested on March 8, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. The government argued his activism impeded on US foreign policy and moved to have him deported. Speaking before heading to New York from Louisiana, he said he was eager to see his wife and son, who was born during his detention. </p>
