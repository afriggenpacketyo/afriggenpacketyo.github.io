          <p>The town of Clarksdale, Mississippi, hosted a three-day festival called Clarksdale Cultural Capital to celebrate the release of Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*, a thriller set in the town during the 1930s. The festival included free screenings of the movie for residents, many of whom had no prior access to a movie theater in their community. Coogler and his wife, along with other members of the film's cast and crew, attended the event, expressing their gratitude to the town for inspiring the film. The festival also featured panels, music performances, and other events highlighting the culture and history of Clarksdale and the Mississippi Delta.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 11:00:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water supplies in the US would lead to an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years. This represents a 7.5% increase in cavities and an added cost of $9.8 billion, disproportionately affecting children on public health insurance or lacking insurance. The study contradicts claims made in a recent report led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which downplayed the protective effects of fluoride. The research highlights the significant public health benefits of water fluoridation in preventing tooth decay.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, stating that kids with no underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccines, replacing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. The agency has also deleted a statement that the guidance had been recommended by a committee, approved by the CDC, and backed by outside medical groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel is finalized. The agreement, which was initially blocked by former President Biden, will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania and is characterized by Trump as an investment controlled by the United States. The deal includes a golden share provision, requiring U.S. government approval for certain board members to ensure production levels are maintained. The United Steelworkers union has expressed opposition to the sale, citing concerns about potential job losses.</p>

          <p>U.S. airlines are competing for dominance in international business-class travel by offering enhanced amenities such as caviar, Bang & Olufsen headphones, and private suites with sliding doors. American Airlines is introducing upgraded business-class "suites" with features like a "trinket tray" and wireless charging pad, while United Airlines is creating a new "Polaris Studio" with an ottoman and larger screens. These upgrades aim to attract more customers to pay for pricier seats, which is key for an industry with high costs and thin margins. The airlines are betting that consumers will continue to splurge on better travel experiences despite weaker demand for lower-priced tickets.</p>

          <p>HMS Lancaster, a Royal Navy warship based in Portsmouth, has seized ¬£30m worth of illegal drugs while at sea in the Middle East. The ship secretly shadowed a suspect vessel for over 24 hours before intercepting it, discovering one and a half tonnes of narcotics. The operation involved a Royal Marines sniper in a Wildcat helicopter and a boarding team of 42 Commando. This is the second bust in three months for the British frigate, which is deployed to the Middle East as part of efforts to provide regional maritime security and stability.</p>
