Furness shared an emotional statement emphasizing compassion for those who have experienced betrayal and expressing her belief in a higher power. Jackman's friend mentioned that the actor is "moving on with his life," while Foster had previously filed for divorce from her husband in October. </p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie at the French Open to advance to the quarter-finals, continuing his dominance over the British player. Despite Norrie's improved performance this year, he struggled to convert key opportunities against Djokovic, who needed medical treatment for foot blisters during the match. Djokovic's victory extends his winning streak against Norrie and demonstrates his strong form at Roland Garros. Norrie will move back into the top 60, concluding a successful clay-court swing after facing challenges with form and fitness earlier in the year. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that following the MIND diet, which combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, can significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, even when started later in life. Participants who closely adhered to the MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over 10 years had a 25% lower risk. The diet emphasizes brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil. This research supports previous findings highlighting the benefits of plant-focused diets in preventing the progressive brain disorder. </p>

          <p>The U.S. office market has reached an inflection point, with more office space being removed through demolitions and conversions than added through new construction for the first time in at least 25 years. CBRE Group data indicates that 23.3 million square feet of office space is slated for demolition or conversion, while only 12.7 million square feet of new space is projected to be completed. This net reduction is expected to lower the vacancy rate and benefit building owners. The shift is driven by the rise in remote work, but the market is starting to recover with increased office-leasing activity and stabilizing rents. (not investment advice)</p>
