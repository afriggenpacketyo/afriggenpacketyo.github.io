          <h2>Weak Yen Fuels Surge in Chinese Tourism and Spending in Japan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant increase in Chinese tourists visiting Japan has been recorded this year, driven largely by the weakening of the Japanese yen, which makes travel and luxury goods more affordable. Data from the Japan National Tourism Organisation shows a substantial rise in visitors from China, with many identified as middle-class and wealthy individuals seeking high-quality Japanese products and cultural experiences. Tourists are reportedly spending generously on items ranging from high-end fashion to unique local merchandise and cuisine. This trend is providing a welcome boost to Japan's tourism sector as it continues its post-pandemic recovery and navigates economic shifts in the region.</p>

          <p>Actress Julia Roberts recently revealed that she felt both intimidated and scared before her first meeting with fellow actress and "After the Hunt" co-star Chloë Sevigny. In a group interview, Roberts described becoming flustered at her home when Sevigny was scheduled to arrive for a rehearsal, a feeling shared by co-star Ayo Edebiri. For her part, Sevigny expressed that she felt an immediate closeness to Roberts and praised her generosity during the film's production. The exchange highlighted the mutual respect and admiration among the cast of the upcoming film, which centers on a university professor caught in the middle of a sexual assault accusation involving a colleague.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that by 2030, advancements in AI and robotics will eliminate most jobs, leading to a society of "sustainable abundance." He suggests this future will necessitate not just a universal basic income, but a "universal high income," where everyone will have access to the best housing, healthcare, and other necessities. This optimistic vision contrasts with widespread anxiety about job displacement due to automation. However, critics question the feasibility of such a system, pointing to current government debt and the political challenges of funding large-scale universal programs, raising concerns about how this transition would be practically and financially managed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theatrical adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" is bringing the story into the modern era, trading Regency-era society balls for the world of nightclubs and dating apps. Staged at London's Rose Theatre, this version portrays the meddling protagonist Emma Woodhouse as a university student who returns home and begins interfering in her friends' online dating lives. Writer Ava Pickett drew from her own experiences to explore themes of social pressure, friendship, and self-discovery in a contemporary setting. The production reflects a continued cultural fascination with Austen's work, examining how her timeless social commentary on love and relationships translates to the complexities of modern life.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Creatine's Potential to Combat Brain Fog and Enhance Cognitive Function</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The supplement creatine, long popular among athletes for boosting muscle performance, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating brain fog. While extensively researched for its physical effects, a growing body of evidence suggests creatine may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus by helping brain cells produce energy. This has drawn interest from individuals experiencing cognitive slowness, including women in perimenopause. Experts caution that while the research is promising, more studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness for brain function, and it may only provide benefits for individuals under specific kinds of stress, such as sleep deprivation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has outlined a potential deal for TikTok's U.S. operations that would place the app's powerful algorithm under the control of American companies. Under the proposed agreement, U.S. entities would also hold six of the seven board seats for the new U.S.-based company. The deal aims to address national security concerns related to the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its access to American user data. Tech giant Oracle is set to lead data and privacy management for the app in the U.S. While President Trump has indicated his approval, the deal has not yet been finalized and is still awaiting comment from Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have made a significant breakthrough by successfully observing shock-induced amorphization in diamond capsules for the first time, a discovery with major implications for nuclear fusion energy. By using powerful lasers to compress the diamond, scientists were able to collapse its atomic structure, helping them better understand the material's behavior under extreme pressure. This knowledge is crucial for achieving the symmetrical implosion needed to generate fusion energy, a clean and virtually limitless power source. The findings will aid further research at facilities like the National Ignition Facility, bringing the world one step closer to harnessing this transformative green energy technology.</p>
