          <h2>Study Challenges Beliefs About Healthier Food Choices: Homemade vs. Processed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 07:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in *Food Science* challenges the notion that homemade foods are inherently healthier than their industrially processed counterparts, finding no significant nutritional superiority or fewer harmful compounds in homemade versions of common foods. Experts suggest that both at-home and manufactured foods can contribute to a healthy lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of monitoring nutritional parameters such as sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats regardless of the food's origin. The article highlights that food processing is essentially a larger-scale version of home cooking techniques, often with tighter controls and hygiene standards, but also notes that at-home preparation allows for more control over ingredient quality and selection. Michelle Patidar, a health nutrition coach, supports making food at home with whole ingredients to avoid unwanted additives. </p>

          <p>A taskforce of experts is working to save Florida's coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient and fast-growing species. The reefs have suffered significant decline due to record ocean heat and climate change, losing 90% of their healthy coral cover in the last 40 years. The project, a collaboration between the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium, aims to restore the reefs and create a habitat for marine life. Biologists are carefully selecting and spawning genetically diverse corals to enhance their resilience to future stressors, hoping to contribute to a broader effort involving various organizations to restore lost coral. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the U.S. mortgage market. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, aims to release the firms from conservatorship, benefiting investors but raising concerns about mortgage market disruption. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn of potential risks to homebuyers. The Trump administration is evaluating the proposal carefully to strengthen the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and restore homeownership, with changes expected to be implemented deliberately to avoid immediate impacts on mortgage prices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts recommend that new homeowners review the accuracy of their property tax assessments, as inaccuracies can lead to overpayment. Sal Cataldo, a real estate lawyer, suggests that essential documents from the home purchase, such as the title report and home inspection report, can aid in appealing an inaccurate assessment. A home sale typically triggers a property tax reassessment, with the new market value applied, though specific rules vary by area. Reviewing the assessment can help homeowners ensure they are paying the correct amount in property taxes. (not investment advice) </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues have discovered that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Initially, Haridy sought to understand how vertebrate skeletons first came to be, studying fragments of Anatolepis, an ancient organism thought to be the earliest vertebrate. Upon closer examination, she discovered that Anatolepis was actually an invertebrate, resembling the teeth of vertebrates and suggesting a shared purpose related to sensitivity. This research explains why humans experience toothaches and links the ability to sense pain and temperature to the evolutionary history of teeth. </p>
