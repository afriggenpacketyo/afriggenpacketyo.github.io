        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine, is reportedly in late-stage discussions to raise $500 million at a $14 billion valuation, with Accel leading the round. This funding comes amidst a generative AI boom, driven by the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Perplexity is focusing on its upcoming AI agent web browser, Comet, but faces increasing competition from Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI, all of whom are developing their own AI-driven search capabilities. The funding is expected to help Perplexity compete in the rapidly evolving AI search market, where it aims to differentiate itself from traditional search engines. </p>

          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, with Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt ordering the federal police to turn away non-EU citizens without a visa, including asylum seekers who have already applied in another EU country. This move, based on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's election pledge, aims to curb irregular immigration and motivate EU neighbors to prevent migrants from passing through to Germany. Exceptions will be made for vulnerable individuals like pregnant women and unaccompanied minors. The policy is controversial, with left-wing politicians criticizing it as a breach of European law, while the far-right AfD seeks even stricter measures. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party has announced its plans to reduce immigration to the UK, focusing on a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements, generally requiring degree-level qualifications for skilled workers, but loosening them for graduates of elite universities outside the UK. Immigrants will typically need to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for indefinite leave to remain, with a potential reduction through an "earned settlement" system. The dedicated visa for social care workers will be scrapped, and stricter rules will be applied to overseas graduates and their dependents. </p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a step towards de-escalating the trade war between the two largest economies.

Under the agreement, the U.S. would reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, while China would lower import duties on American goods.

The order aims to end U.S. subsidization of foreign healthcare. The plan includes a "most favored nation" pricing model, and a mechanism for Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the lowest international price. This is intended to reduce drug prices by 50% to 90%. </p>

          <p>President Trump praised Qatar for offering the U.S. a 747 jet to serve as Air Force One, attributing the need for the donation to delays at Boeing. Trump expressed disappointment in the time it has taken Boeing to build a new Air Force One. A White House official clarified that no aircraft "gift" will be presented or accepted during Trump's visit to Qatar this week. Qatar confirmed that the "transfer of an aircraft for temporary use" to the U.S. Department of Defense was under consideration. </p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, crashed back to Earth after over 50 years in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. The spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere and landed in the Indian Ocean, with multiple space agencies confirming the reentry time and location. Because of the vehicle's robust design, it was possible that some of it survived the reentry. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce prices in the United States, but it lacked clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The order called on federal agencies to investigate lower prices in Europe and push them to pay more. The pharmaceutical industry viewed it as a win, as they had been bracing for a more damaging policy. The order does not link U.S. drug prices to those in peer countries. </p>
