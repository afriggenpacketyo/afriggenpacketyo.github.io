          <p>Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University in Beijing has achieved a breakthrough in computing by initiating mass production of a non-binary AI chip. This innovation merges binary and stochastic logic, leading to enhanced fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications such as touch displays and flight systems. This development also circumvents US chip restrictions, presenting a significant advancement in China's technological capabilities. The team's Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, addressing challenges related to power consumption and communication with traditional systems. The implications of this technology could be far-reaching, influencing various sectors reliant on AI and computing power.</p>

          <p>The NHS is urgently seeking 200,000 new blood donors to address a challenging blood shortage and maintain a safe and reliable supply. The number of regular donors needs to increase to over one million to avoid a "red alert" situation, where demand exceeds capacity. There is a particular need for donors with O negative blood and more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types that can help treat sickle cell disease. The appeal comes after the NHS issued an amber alert last year due to low blood stocks.</p>
