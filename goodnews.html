        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data indicates a significant drop in U.S. usage for e-commerce giants Temu and Shein following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' loophole, which previously allowed tariff-free shipments of low-cost goods under $800. Temu's daily active users (DAUs) in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%. These declines are also reflected in lower rankings on the Apple App Store and reduced U.S. advertising spending by both companies in recent months. The impact of these changes highlights the sensitivity of these businesses to trade policies and regulations.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected 'winter fuel U-turn,' restoring payments to pensioners but recouping funds from wealthier recipients through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential 'chaos' as tax officials may pursue bereaved families of deceased pensioners to recover the payments. Immigration policies are also a key focus, with contrasting approaches from Labour and Conservative leaders highlighted. Other stories include potential side effects of weight-loss jabs, Trump's economic policies increasing US debt, and expanded free school meals for children. </p>

          <p>A charity, Thin Blue Paw, is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complex medical needs and vet costs. These dogs risk their lives in the line of duty, apprehending suspects and dealing with public disorder, and often retire with chronic health issues and injuries. Adopters face significant expenses, averaging ¬£3,000 more per year compared to other dogs, and insurance can be difficult to obtain. The charity argues that providing pensions is a responsibility to these animals who have served and protected the community.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting solar power, potentially creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report highlights that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants financed by China, leading to stranded assets. It advocates for developing indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. A Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is economically viable, initiating a debate about the role of Chinese solar technology in developing nations.</p>

This referendum is considered a rare chance to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent, as the Italian state has been tightening its citizenship rules for the past three decades. The vote also has cultural implications, asking citizens to make a statement about their own identity and whether they prioritize inclusivity and diversity over ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Prime Minister Meloni and several high-profile ministers have been encouraging people to skip the vote, hoping the referendum will not reach quorum.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school. The venue provided a special setting for the 740 graduating seniors, though students expressed sadness at not being able to graduate at their beloved Stadium by the Sea. The ceremony featured remarks from Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors, and comedian Billy Crystal, whose home burned down in January. Perseverance in the face of tragedy was a key theme of the event.</p>
