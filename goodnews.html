          <p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda affiliate leader previously designated a U.S. terrorist, faces immense challenges in stabilizing and rebuilding a fractured Syria after ending 54 years of Assad rule. His journey from militant to president involves addressing the psychological trauma of war, rebuilding devastated communities, and protecting minorities. Al-Sharaa seeks international aid and the lifting of harsh economic sanctions, which he argues are crucial for Syria's recovery. He also navigates complex geopolitical relationships, including with Russia and Israel, while promising a transition to an elected government and a future where every Syrian gets a vote.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes challenging amidst life's demands, leading to a phenomenon dubbed "ghosting" where connections fade. Research indicates individuals lose about half their friends every seven years as life stages shift, making friendships "collateral damage." Relationship experts emphasize honest communication, vulnerability, and creative approaches to spending time together, even through mundane activities. Psychologist Julia Samuels advises embracing "mess" and integrating friends into daily life rather than waiting for perfect moments. Experts stress the importance of in-person connection over virtual messaging and encourage individuals to trust that their friends value them more than they might perceive, advocating for proactive effort to combat "relational loneliness."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test involving impromptu public speaking and mental arithmetic, a BBC reporter's nose temperature dropped by two degrees, a physical reaction where blood flow shifts from the nose to eyes and ears in response to perceived danger. This non-invasive technique, which saw similar results in 29 volunteers, could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in humans, including babies, and even non-human apes, potentially identifying risk markers for anxiety or depression.</p>

Downing Street stated the summit marks a historic turning point, aiming to secure the ceasefire, deliver humanitarian aid, and establish lasting peace and security. However, UK claims of a key role have been criticized by US and Israeli officials, who credit Trump and suggest UK actions emboldened Hamas.</p>

          <p>Renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau shares his personal views on China's strategy for achieving global leadership in science and technology, particularly amid the tech race with the US. Yau emphasizes the critical importance of domestically groomed talent, acknowledging China's significant strides in manufacturing due to its vast pool of skilled labor. He suggests that while the workforce may not always be highly qualified, it is competent enough to drive industrial success and compete with the United States in various domains. The article touches on Hong Kong's potential role as a science and tech hub and its opportunity to host a top-tier mathematics conference.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, has opened bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, proposing a merger that could significantly reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. David Ellison, leading Skydance Media, aims for an audacious acquisition that could consolidate CNN with CBS News and provide Paramount with much-needed content to compete with streaming giants. The move comes as Warner Bros. Discovery plans to split its assets, and despite its recent box office successes, it carries substantial debt, making the sale a complex but potentially strategic move for both entities.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met, agreeing that the two Asian powers should be "partners" rather than "rivals" and committed to settling their border dispute. Modi emphasized the need for "strategic autonomy" and not viewing bilateral relations through a "third country lens," subtly referencing the U.S. Both leaders envision strong Sino-Indian ties as crucial for a multipolar world and a new Asian century. This move, including the resumption of direct flights, signals India's intent to reset historically fraught relations with China and potentially forge an Eastern coalition against an increasingly hostile West.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has secured at least a play-off spot for the 2026 World Cup finals, with their qualification path becoming clearer. Following a victory against Belarus and Denmark's win over Greece, Scotland will now contend with Denmark for an automatic qualification spot, or face the tension of March's play-offs. Both teams are tied on points, but Denmark holds a goal difference advantage, which is the primary tie-breaker. Scotland faces Greece away and then a potential winner-takes-all encounter against Denmark at Hampden, making the upcoming matches crucial for their hopes of reaching their first men's World Cup in 28 years.</p>

          <p>Despite securing a World Cup qualifying win over Belarus, Scotland's coach Steve Clarke expressed extreme anger over his team's "really, really poor" and lacklustre performance. The victory, which guaranteed at least a play-off spot, was met with boos from fans and fury from Clarke at half-time, as described by midfielder John McGinn. The team's subdued lap of honor reflected widespread frustration over their failure to meet expected performance levels, particularly after struggling against Greece earlier. While acknowledging their strong position in the group, players and coach agree they need to significantly improve to achieve automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup.</p>
