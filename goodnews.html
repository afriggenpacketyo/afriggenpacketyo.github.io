          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule ahead of the August 1st deadline. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet celebrated a significant reduction in duties from 49% to 19%, viewing it as positive for the nation's economy. Similarly, Thailand's finance minister expressed that the new 19% rate reflects a strong partnership with the U.S., though the government is preparing support for affected businesses. Meanwhile, Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff, a reduction from the previously announced 32%, with its president noting that negotiations are ongoing for further decreases.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to build a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a $200 million project President Trump intends to complete before the end of his term. Trump stated the new facility is needed to host large-scale events, which currently require using tents on the South Lawn. The construction will be funded by Trump himself and other "patriot donors," with the president describing it as "his gift to the country." This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, replacing the current East Wing.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with its stock price soaring 250% on the first day of trading. This blockbuster IPO has created approximately $24 billion in paper wealth for its four main venture capital backers: Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. The successful offering is a bright spot in the tech IPO market, which has been largely dormant since late 2021. Figma's market capitalization reached nearly $68 billion, more than triple the $20 billion Adobe had offered to acquire it for in a deal that was ultimately blocked by regulators.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the termination, which was set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson stated that the administration's actions appeared to be based on a "preordained determination to end the TPS program" rather than an objective review of country conditions. Most of the affected individuals have been living legally in the U.S. for over two decades.</p>

          <p>Researchers have solved a long-standing botanical mystery, discovering that the modern potato evolved from an ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the potato was created through a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. The tomato parent provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form starchy tubers, while the other parent contributed a gene that helps control their growth. This finding demonstrates how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations. The impressive performance was driven by record sales for the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, along with a new all-time high for its installed base of active devices. Despite the positive numbers, the company offered little new information regarding its artificial intelligence strategy, a key area of focus for investors. This leaves Apple as an AI "show me" story in a market that is heavily prioritizing developments in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery to become a Civil War hero and U.S. congressman, is being created for the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This monument will be the first to honor an individual African American at the state capitol, which is currently surrounded by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The bipartisan-backed project is seen by historians as a step toward completing the state's historical narrative. The sculpture, designed by artist Basil Watson, will depict Smalls' journey and legacy as a pioneering champion of civil rights and equality.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed expectations for both revenue and profit, with sales growing 13% to $167.7 billion. The company's high-margin advertising and e-commerce segments showed particular strength. However, investors were disappointed by the relatively modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a mixed forecast for the upcoming quarter. Despite the strong overall performance, the stock fell in after-hours trading, reflecting market concerns about AWS's competitive position in the AI race and the slightly cautious operating income guidance.

          <p>The UK government has announced a policy change that will restrict its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The move, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves and harness a broader range of talent. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program, as part of a wider effort to diversify the traditionally privileged institution.</p>
