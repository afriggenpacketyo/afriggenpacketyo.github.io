        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The skull-and-straw-hat flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has been adopted as a symbol of resistance by youth-led protest movements around the world. The flag, representing freedom and rebellion against corrupt authority in the series, first gained prominence in Indonesia and was later seen during anti-government demonstrations in Nepal. Its use has now spread to countries like the Philippines, Kenya, and Madagascar, uniting Gen Z activists who resonate with the story's themes. This follows a trend of pop culture symbols being repurposed for real-world political expression.</p>

          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a major move to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence. The acquisition is central to founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI," which aims to integrate advanced artificial intelligence with robotics. This deal adds a world-class robotics technology portfolio to SoftBank's existing AI-related assets, which include chip designer Arm and a significant stake in OpenAI. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to shareholders and finalizes the strategic separation of its robotics business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with total payouts estimated at £8.2 billion. The scheme addresses unfair commission arrangements and inaccurate information provided in approximately 14 million motor finance agreements between 2007 and 2024, with the average payout expected to be around £700 per claim. The FCA's chief executive stated it is time for customers to receive fair compensation. While consumer advocates welcomed the move, the lending industry suggested the scale of compensation may be excessive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford is set to break a 7-consecutive-clean-sheet record for England, cementing his status as the nation's undisputed number one goalkeeper. Despite occasional criticism of his on-pitch temperament, former players and experts praise his technical skills, particularly his long-range distribution and improved consistency. Now 31, Pickford has matured, reducing the errors that marked his early career while maintaining his crucial reflex saves and penalty shootout prowess. His reliability for both club and country has silenced most debates about his position, making him an indispensable part of the national team.</p>

          <p>Around 900 individuals, including 580 hikers and over 300 local guides and staff, have been safely evacuated after a severe weekend snowstorm on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The storm trapped them in tents at an altitude above 16,000 feet, cutting off access. While the rescue operation was successful, related weather events in the Himalayas have been deadly, with one person dying of hypothermia in a neighboring Chinese province and a South Korean climber perishing on a peak in Nepal. The Everest scenic area in Tibet has been temporarily closed to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fred Ramsdell, an American immunologist, discovered he had won the Nobel Prize in Medicine while on a remote hiking trip in Montana's grizzly bear country. With his phone on airplane mode, the Nobel committee was unable to reach him, and he only learned of the honor when his wife received a flood of congratulatory text messages. Dr. Ramsdell, who won for his research into the immune system, was one of the most difficult laureates to contact in recent history. The amusing incident adds to a history of Nobel winners learning of their prize in unusual circumstances.</p>

          <h2>New Technique May Allow Kidney Transplants Across Blood Types, Expanding Donor Pool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully demonstrated a new technique that converts the blood type of a donor kidney, potentially revolutionizing organ transplantation by expanding the pool of available organs. By using enzymes to remove the blood type antigens from a donor kidney, scientists were able to transplant it into a recipient of a different blood type without immediate rejection. The procedure, tested on a brain-dead recipient, functioned for two days and could significantly reduce wait times and improve allocation equality. This breakthrough offers a more immediate solution than animal-to-human transplants, which have recently faced significant setbacks.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has addressed his decision to initially hold back relief pitcher Roki Sasaki from a save situation in Game 2 of the National League Division Series. Roberts explained he was trying to manage the workload of the 23-year-old rookie, who has only recently transitioned to the bullpen after a shoulder injury. The initial plan to use another reliever almost backfired, forcing Sasaki to enter the game anyway to secure the final out. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the primary option for save situations, but the team will remain cautious about overusing him.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the celebrated author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his follow-up book was significantly delayed after his iPad containing many ideas and drawings was stolen. The device, which had not been backed up, was taken from his unlocked car, forcing him to recreate much of the work from memory. Mackesy also faced profound personal grief during the book's creation, including the loss of his mother and his dog, who inspired the Mole character. Despite these setbacks, he persevered to complete his new book, "Always Remember."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Herschel Walker, the former football great and 2022 Georgia Senate candidate, to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.

His nomination was approved along with over 100 other Trump appointees in a single en bloc vote, a procedural change implemented by Senate Republicans to expedite confirmations. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner, was a prominent supporter of Trump and ran for Senate with his backing, losing in a runoff.</p>
