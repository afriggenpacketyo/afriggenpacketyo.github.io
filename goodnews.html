        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker SMIC experienced a nearly 7% drop after the company's first-quarter earnings fell short of anticipated figures. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-over-year to $2.24 billion and profits attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these numbers did not meet LSEG's estimates. A company representative attributed the shortfall to production fluctuations that led to lower average selling prices, which is expected to continue into the second quarter. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical shifts and increased demand due to government policies.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs as Shipments to Southeast Asia Increase</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently implemented tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, exports to ASEAN surged by 20.8%. Analysts suggest that the overall export growth may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs. The Chinese government has been encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs, potentially leading to deeper deflation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-3, in what manager Dave Roberts called a sign of the competitive nature of the National League West, which he believes is the best division in baseball. Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled, allowing five runs, while Arizona's Brandon Pfaadt pitched well. Shohei Ohtani hit a solo home run in the ninth, but the Dodgers couldn't complete the comeback. The loss highlighted the challenges the Dodgers may face in their division, with multiple teams posing a significant threat.</p>

          <p>Newspaper front pages are dominated by the new trade agreement between the US and the UK, with many outlets highlighting its potential to save the British car industry from American tariffs. The agreement, described as "historic" by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, has drawn varied reactions, with some noting its limited scope. The selection of a new Pope, Leo XIV, also features prominently, with reports focusing on his message of building bridges and his past criticism of the Trump administration. The papers also reflect on the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day and King's VE Day message.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Show Resilience in April Despite US Tariff War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 23:12:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1 per cent year on year in April, defying US President Donald Trump‚Äôs unprecedented tariff increases. The figure beat market expectations and followed a rise in March. Analysts suggest that the damage of the US tariffs has not yet shown up in the trade data, possibly due to transshipment through other countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145 per cent on a wide range of Chinese imports this year, prompting retaliation from China.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, a victim's impact statement in a manslaughter case featured an AI-generated likeness of the deceased, Christopher Pelkey. His sister, Stacey Wales, used AI to recreate his voice and image, allowing him to "speak" at the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The judge praised the video, but the use of AI in legal proceedings has sparked debate, with concerns about manipulation and deception. This article explores the ethical and legal implications of using AI in courtrooms.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering a trade deal with the U.S. that includes zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a potential shift away from its protectionist policies. This move comes in response to pressure from U.S. President Trump's tariffs. Experts suggest that a trade deal could boost India's economic growth and attract foreign investment, while others caution against harming domestic industries. The article analyzes the potential winners and losers in the Indian stock market based on the outcome of the trade negotiations.</p>
