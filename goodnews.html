          <h2>UK Government Defends National Insurance Exemption in Trade Agreement with India</h2>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties claim this could undercut British workers, but Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds argues the UK has similar agreements with over 50 countries, including the US and EU. The deal aims to boost trade between the two countries by an additional ¬£25.5bn a year by 2040, lowering tariffs on UK exports like whisky and cars, and Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a ¬£1bn increase in Scotch exports to India over the next five years.</p>

          <p>While AI models are increasingly used for forecasting, they have not yet surpassed human superforecasters in accuracy. Metaculus, a prediction website, hosts tournaments where human and AI forecasters compete, and humans consistently outperform machines. However, the gap is narrowing, and simpler AI models using recent news articles have shown surprising effectiveness. Despite advancements, AI faces challenges in quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills, limiting their ability to make consistent and accurate predictions. The article suggests that AI could eventually outperform humans due to their capacity for objectivity and continuous learning, but trust and understanding of AI forecasts remain key hurdles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian markets have largely shrugged off recent military strikes against Pakistan, with investors remaining optimistic about India's growth prospects. Analysts attribute this resilience to structural reforms, strong domestic demand, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals. The progress in India's trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the UK, is also contributing to market confidence. While some short-term volatility is expected, investors are hopeful for a swift de-escalation of tensions, limiting any significant market fallout.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares have increased following the company's announcement that sales of its weight loss drug Wegovy are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025 due to the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical company reported higher-than-expected first-quarter net profit, despite lower-than-anticipated sales of Wegovy. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen stated that the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA would allow sales to rebound. The company also highlighted new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy services and partnerships with telehealth providers to lower costs and offer a safe alternative to compounded drugs.</p>

          <p>The Real ID Act deadline has arrived, requiring Americans to have Real ID-compliant identification to board domestic flights, although a soft launch allows travelers without Real IDs to undergo additional screening. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that those without Real IDs will still be able to fly, but may face extra verification steps. The law, passed in 2005, aims to enhance security by establishing national standards for identification, but some states have faced challenges in implementation, leading to multiple deadline extensions. While some worry about potential delays, TSA officials anticipate minimal disruptions, especially for those with compliant IDs or passports.</p>
