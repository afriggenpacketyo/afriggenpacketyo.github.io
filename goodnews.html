        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has rejected Erik and Lyle Menendez's petition for a new trial, asserting that the new evidence presented, including a letter from Erik detailing alleged abuse and a declaration from Roy Rossello claiming sexual assault by their father, was not compelling enough to alter the original verdict. The brothers, convicted in 1996 for the murders of their parents, argued self-defense due to alleged abuse. The judge stated that the evidence did not add significantly to allegations already considered by the jury. The brothers were resentenced in May 2024, making them eligible for parole, but were denied by a state parole board in August, and their clemency petitions to Gov. Gavin Newsom are pending. The optimism score is based on the stability of the legal process and the lack of new information that would change the verdict. The judge's decision was applauded by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who deemed the habeas motion meritless. </p>

          <p>NPR is planning to trim $5 million from its budget this year without layoffs or major programming shifts, as public radio stations grapple with financial challenges following congressional defunding. Listener contributions have increased, helping to offset cuts, but the long-term financial stability of the public radio system remains uncertain. NPR CEO Katherine Maher is offering $8 million in relief to struggling stations, though some officials argue more support is needed. NPR is exploring new revenue streams, such as a "donate now" button on Tiny Desk Concerts, and collaborating with stations on reporting initiatives. The article indicates the optimism score based on the measures NPR is taking to address the funding challenges. </p>

          <p>Indiana Fever stars Caitlin Clark and Sophie Cunningham, sidelined due to season-ending injuries, protested a traveling call during a playoff game against the Atlanta Dream. Their demonstrative gesture went viral on social media, and Clark playfully repeated it when officials later called a travel on Atlanta. The Fever won the game, evening the series, but will have to continue without Clark and Cunningham. The optimism score is based on the team's victory and the players' continued engagement despite their injuries. </p>
