          <p>Southern California is expected to experience a significant drop in temperatures and light rain after a record-breaking heat wave over the weekend. The National Weather Service predicts temperatures will decrease by more than 20 degrees, with coastal areas hovering in the mid-60s. A heavy marine layer will bring low clouds and drizzle, potentially affecting the morning commute. This respite follows a surge in temperatures that led to numerous heat-related rescues on hiking trails, with downtown Los Angeles setting a new record high of 103 degrees.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of "substantial progress" in US-China trade talks, analysts are offering cautious optimism. Christopher Hodge of Natixis suggests a de-escalation was inevitable but expects limited durable outcomes beyond tariff reductions and agricultural purchase agreements. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital views the news as slightly better than expected, potentially removing the threat of a full-blown trade war. Eric Kuby of North Star Investment Management describes it as a step in the right direction, but not likely to trigger a dramatic market rally.</p>
