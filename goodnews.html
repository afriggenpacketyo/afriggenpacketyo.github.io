          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the return of standalone physical stores, years after its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, recently hosted its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling its intent to reclaim its former status as a fashion powerhouse. While nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials and Gen Z, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting new, younger shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. Topshop's management states the relaunch will focus on high-quality, fashionable products that offer good value.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant from Aberdeen, Scotland, earned Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 attack on a German U-boat. Despite sustaining 72 injuries, including wounds to his lungs, he successfully destroyed the submarine before returning his crew to base. Remembered as a stoic and humble man, Flt Lt Cruickshank rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his heroic actions simply as his duty.</p>

          <p>During the recent summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the plight of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred to Russia since the 2022 invasion, an act the International Criminal Court has classified as a war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the First Lady's efforts to highlight the issue. This diplomatic gesture brings renewed attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis involving the children, which U.S. lawmakers have condemned as "state-sponsored child trafficking."</p>

          <p>Quantum computing company IonQ is being presented as a significant investment opportunity, with one Wall Street analyst setting a price target suggesting a 70% potential increase in its stock value. The company's CEO has projected that IonQ will achieve profitability and generate nearly $1 billion in sales by 2030, anticipating massive market growth in the following years. With $1.6 billion in cash and investments, IonQ appears well-capitalized to fund its research and development until it reaches profitability. The article suggests that momentum in the quantum computing sector could continue to drive the stock's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes achieved multiple record closes this week, driven by speculation over the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. Market optimism was initially fueled by a cooler-than-expected July consumer price index, which raised hopes for a rate cut in September. However, momentum slowed after a subsequent report showed wholesale inflation rose more than anticipated, though expectations for a rate cut remained high. The week also saw strong earnings from Cisco, despite a revenue miss in its security division, and record highs for several major companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are reportedly moving to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, along with their three children. The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included the Princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. According to a royal source, the move represents a "fresh start" and an opportunity to create a long-term family home away from some difficult memories. The relocation and any associated renovations will be funded privately by the couple, who will pay market rent on the property.</p>

          <p>An architecture-driven startup in Phoenix is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers joined in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The design prioritizes environmental benefits by using existing materials and can be constructed in just one week, offering a cost-effective solution to the affordable housing crisis. The project's creator is now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same innovative method.</p>

          <p>An in-depth profile explores the unconventional leadership of Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old billionaire CEO who founded healthcare software giant Epic Systems in 1979. The article details her steadfast refusal to take the company public or engage in acquisitions, guided by principles she calls her "10 commandments." From its whimsical, themed campus in Wisconsin, Epic has grown to dominate the electronic health record market, with its software used by a majority of top U.S. hospitals. Faulkner has established a complex trust to ensure the company remains privately held and true to her vision long after she steps down.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows a 13% decrease in immigration arrests nationwide during July compared to the previous month. While ICE has not commented on the decline, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts may be a contributing factor. In places like Oregon, a combination of nightly protests, a "rapid-response" hotline to provide immediate legal aid, and a state "sanctuary" law that limits local cooperation with federal agents creates significant challenges for large-scale enforcement operations. The lack of an ICE detention facility within Oregon further complicates the agency's ability to process arrests in the state.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds for the victory, with Lyles finishing second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles remained positive, viewing the sub-10-second performance as a crucial step in building confidence ahead of the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of Tulare County, California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States in the new energy sector. The technology involves orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The academic, Ge Changchun, argued for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current fragmented research efforts led by universities. He noted that China's development in this area lags behind the U.S., which has been experimenting with the concept since the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate had placed as a deposit for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court granted the forfeiture order after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, an order which Tate and his brother did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million in other funds taken from the brothers by the same police force in December 2024 for tax evasion. The police stated the seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives.</p>

Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of the basic necessities they will need, from bedding and towels to lamps and toolkits. The non-profit, founded after hearing of a student who arrived with only a trash bag, aims to level the playing field by kitting out over 140 students annually. The initiative ensures they can start their college experience feeling prepared and equal to their peers.</p>
