          <p>At least ten people sustained minor injuries when a yacht carrying approximately 400 passengers struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City. The New York City Fire Department's marine units escorted the vessel to a dock where passengers disembarked, and the injured were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation by authorities. This incident follows a similar event last month involving a Mexican navy training ship hitting the Brooklyn Bridge. The optimism score reflects the minor nature of the injuries reported.</p>

          <p>The appearance of a senior Taiwanese officer at a US military exercise in Alaska has sparked discussions about closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States.
