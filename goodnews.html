          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, who represents the moderate faction, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people, by respecting and reflecting modern Australia. She plans a review of all policies, including nuclear energy and net-zero emissions goals, emphasizing a fresh approach and collaborative decision-making, while Albanese's new cabinet was sworn in, marking significant changes in key portfolios.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a substantial amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings provide the first seismic evidence of liquid water in the Martian upper crust, influencing our understanding of the planet's water cycle and the potential for habitable environments.</p>

          <p>German companies, long-standing investors in the United States, are reassessing their strategies due to recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook among German manufacturers with U.S. factories. While companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have engaged in talks to mitigate the impact of tariffs, many firms are opting to keep investments in Germany, encouraged by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and investing in infrastructure. The article highlights the discrepancy in investment flows, with German companies investing significantly more in the U.S. than vice versa.</p>

          <p>The American perception of China is split between a technological superpower and an economy on the brink of collapse, each reflecting a real aspect of the country. While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei demonstrate innovation, China faces sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Despite these challenges, Chinese tech entrepreneurs express optimism, planning investments in AI and robotics, though they acknowledge that technological advances alone cannot solve China's economic imbalances.

          <p>Australian pension funds, managing A$4.2 trillion, are reconsidering their long-held strategies of investing in U.S. assets and the dollar due to waning confidence in American growth. Volatility from Sino-U.S. trade tensions has prompted a reassessment of U.S. exposure, with the dollar failing to act as a safe haven amid economic policy uncertainty. Currency dealing desks have noted minor changes in hedging demand from some funds, with a reluctance to fully rebalance hedge ratios as U.S. equities fell, indicating a preference for being longer on the Australian dollar. Ben McCaw of MLC Asset Management has been reducing U.S. dollar currency exposure for about three years.</p>

While the collection totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn mid-auction, while a painting by Lucio Fontana sold for nearly half of its previous price in 2017.</p>
