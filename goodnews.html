          <p>Temu and Shein are facing new challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and increased tariffs on Chinese imports, which had previously allowed them to maintain low prices. Experts suggest that these e-commerce giants are implementing contingency plans, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local fulfillment models, to mitigate the impact of these tariffs. While prices have already risen on Shein, both companies remain competitive, with some experts believing they can still offer products at lower prices than Amazon, even after absorbing tariff costs. The article emphasizes the agility and adaptability of these Chinese e-commerce apps in navigating adverse economic conditions, including a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
