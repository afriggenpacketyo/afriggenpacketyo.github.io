          <p>Yang Weimin, a former high-ranking Chinese official, advocates for a strategic focus on significantly increasing household income over the next five years to bolster China's economy through enhanced consumption. His comments come as the Communist Party prepares to outline its next five-year plan, which is expected to emphasize income and GDP growth, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation. Yang specifically highlighted that the primary cause of weak consumer demand is insufficient income, recommending a greater share of national income be allocated to household disposable income and consumer spending. This policy direction aims to rebalance China's economic model towards internal demand, fostering more sustainable and equitable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Mars Public Library in Butler County, Pennsylvania, is actively soliciting community feedback regarding a potential expansion or relocation, prompted by soaring demand and its current space limitations. Rapid population growth in surrounding areas, including Adams and Middlesex Townships, has led to a doubling of summer reading program participation and library card registrations since 2018. The library is at capacity, with all programs having waitlists. Surveys are gauging resident opinions on a new facility, desired improvements, and their openness to a tax increase, revealing divided views. This effort aims to adapt library services to meet the evolving needs of its rapidly expanding community, with a decision expected by late October.</p>

          <p>Costco surpassed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue, propelled by robust double-digit gains in both membership income and its thriving e-commerce operations. CFO Gary Millerchip detailed the company's proactive strategies to mitigate higher tariff costs, including introducing Kirkland Signature private-label alternatives and shifting merchandise assortment towards less tariff-exposed categories. While food inflation remained steady, non-food merchandise experienced renewed inflation, largely due to imported goods, indicating ongoing supply chain pressures. The retailer is successfully attracting a growing and younger membership base, planning to open 35 new warehouses in the coming fiscal year, underscoring its strong market position and ability to adapt to diverse economic challenges.

          <p>A family from Oklahoma visiting Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park made a remarkable discovery, unearthing a nearly 3-carat brown diamond on the park's north side. Raynae Madison, who found the stone, initially thought it was "too big to be a diamond," but park staff confirmed it as a 2.79-carat chocolate brown diamond, notable for its unique inclusions. The park, a popular 37.5-acre diamond search area, explained that brown diamonds result from plastic deformation during their formation, reflecting red and green light. This significant find, named the William Diamond, is the third-largest registered at the park this year, underscoring the park's continued allure for amateur prospectors.</p>

          <p>British energy giant BP has notably stepped out of the takeover spotlight, with its shares rising over 32% since April, surpassing many U.S. and European competitors. This positive shift is intrinsically linked to a comprehensive strategic reset, a significant leadership shake-up, advancements in its cost-cutting initiatives, and a series of recent oil discoveries. Analysts, who initially doubted the takeover speculation, now point to BP's significantly stronger second-quarter results and the appointment of a new chair known for successful corporate turnarounds. The company's renewed focus on hydrocarbon growth, including a promising discovery in Brazil, has effectively repositioned BP and substantially bolstered investor confidence in its independent future.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom enacted Assembly Bill 238, an urgency measure providing victims of the January 7 firestorms up to one year of mortgage relief, effective immediately. The new law allows homeowners to pause mortgage payments for up to 12 months without late fees or penalties, requiring only an attestation of financial hardship due to the fires. It also explicitly prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating foreclosures or damaging credit scores for participants, and bans lump sum repayments if borrowers were current on payments beforehand. This legislation offers crucial support to thousands of survivors still grappling with rebuilding efforts and ongoing insurance claim issues, providing much-needed financial stability during a difficult recovery period.</p>
