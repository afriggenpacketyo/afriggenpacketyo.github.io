          <p>Oleksandr Usyk secured a decisive victory over Daniel Dubois with a fifth-round knockout, becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion for the second time. The fight, held at Wembley Stadium, saw Usyk demonstrate superior skill and power, extending his undefeated record to 24 wins. Usyk joins Muhammad Ali as only the second man to reign as undisputed heavyweight champion on two separate occasions, cementing his legacy as a dominant force in the division. This victory, part of a strategic plan to reclaim the IBF title he had previously vacated, reinforces his status as the standout heavyweight of his generation.</p>

          <p>This article examines several high-yield midstream energy stocks, suggesting they offer stable, fee-based cash flows and growth opportunities at relatively low valuations. It highlights Energy Transfer for its high yield and growth potential, Enterprise Products Partners as a stable, long-term holding with a history of distribution growth, and Genesis Energy as a potential turnaround story following a strategic business shift. The analysis points to secular trends like supplying natural gas for AI data centers and LNG exports as key drivers for the sector's future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 03:02:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, marking the first time a clear goal has been set on this issue. This pledge follows public outrage over rising pollution incidents, with data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution events in 2024. The plan also aims to reduce phosphorus pollution and ban wet wipes containing plastic. While the government's move is a response to scrutiny over water companies' performance and executive bonuses, critics note the target is a political pledge and not legally binding.</p>

          <p>Filipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, 46, made his return to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw. The bout, held in Las Vegas, saw one judge score in favor of Barrios while the other two scored it even, allowing Barrios to retain his title. Despite showing flashes of his former speed, Pacquiao's performance slowed in the later rounds, though he expressed a belief that he won and called for a rematch. The outcome was a testament to his endurance, but also highlighted the challenge of competing at the highest level after a long hiatus.</p>

          <p>Following a new trade agreement, China's exports of rare earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, reaching 353 metric tons. This sharp increase marks a recovery in the trade of these critical minerals, which are essential for products like electric vehicles and wind turbines. The flow had been severely restricted after China added rare earths to its export control list in April, causing disruptions in global supply chains. The resolution reached in June has eased these restrictions, with analysts expecting shipments to continue recovering as more export licenses are approved.</p>

          <p>A Fitbit fitness tracker played a crucial role in clearing a Wisconsin man who was the initial suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 murder. Doug Detrie was arrested after his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found dead, but data from his Fitbit corroborated his story that he was home and mostly inactive during the time of the crime. This technological alibi, along with other digital evidence, shifted the investigation. Police then used DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and charge George Steven Burch, who was ultimately convicted of the murder.</p>
