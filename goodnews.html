          <h2>Potential Pandemic Prevention Through Far-UVC Light Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 08:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the potential of far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light that can kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes, as a tool to combat respiratory diseases and prevent pandemics. The development of solid-state lamps, particularly those using secondary harmonics, promises to make far-UVC disinfection more affordable and widespread. While concerns about ozone production exist, recent research suggests that these effects can be minimized with proper lamp placement and ventilation. Further research is needed to fully understand the air quality impacts, but the article expresses optimism that far-UVC lamps could become ubiquitous in public spaces, significantly reducing the spread of airborne diseases.

          <p>Starting today, the TSA will enforce Real ID requirements, meaning standard driver's licenses may no longer be sufficient for air travel. While 81% of travelers have compliant IDs, those without can use other forms like passports or undergo identity verification, potentially requiring extra time at the airport. Enhanced licenses from Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington are also accepted. The TSA aims to minimize disruptions, but travelers without Real IDs should arrive at least three hours early for domestic flights to allow for the additional screening process.

          <p>A Jewish professor at Northeastern University describes how her academic life has improved since Donald Trump's re-election as president. She recounts incidents of anti-Israel activism and a lack of administrative support, noting that these issues have diminished since Trump's return. The professor suggests that there is a sense that antisemitism will be punished by the government, leading to fewer classroom disruptions and increased recognition for her service to Jewish students. She believes these positive changes are a result of the "Trump effect". Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger is proposing a change to the offside rule in football to benefit the attacking player. The suggested change is that a player should be onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is level with the defender. Wenger compared the change to one made after the 1990 World Cup and believes it will help increase goal scoring in the sport. He believes the introduction of VAR has negated the advantage that strikers used to have when they were marginally offside. Optimism score: 70</p>
