          <p>The UK Parliament engaged in a heated debate over a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. MPs clashed over the role of doctors, safeguards against coercion, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals. Concerns were raised about pressure on individuals feeling like a burden and the possibility of extending the bill to cover degenerative diseases. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs a free vote on the bill, which has undergone intense scrutiny and amendments since its initial passage. A vote on the bill's future is expected no earlier than June 13.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, positioned as a "bonus" to help retirees keep more money. This alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits aims to provide tax relief to seniors. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, experts note that its impact is modest, potentially cutting taxes by less than $500 per year for a median-income retiree.</p>

Ogles points to O'Connell's executive order aimed at tracking interactions with federal immigration authorities.

          <p>Mike Novogratz detailed the arduous four-year, $25 million journey to list Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq, describing the process as "unfair, infuriating, and un-American." The process stretched to 1,320 days and involved nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than those of traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal strengthened Galaxy, which primarily funded its operations through investment gains and trading. The listing signals a potential return of investor appetite for crypto-adjacent firms after years of caution and volatility.</p>

However, many scientists and AI researchers are skeptical, arguing that current technologies are insufficient to achieve AGI. They point out that today's AI systems primarily predict the next likely word or pixel, differing significantly from human cognition. Claims of AGI's imminent arrival are based on statistical extrapolations and wishful thinking, with no hard evidence that machines can perform tasks like recognizing irony or feeling empathy.</p>
