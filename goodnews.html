          <p>Historians cataloging early medieval Latin medical texts have discovered health and beauty practices that bear a striking resemblance to modern trends seen on platforms like TikTok. These ancient "hacks" include a 12-month herbal detox similar to juice cleanses, a vinegar and flour facial mask for radiant skin, and the use of barley water to aid digestion. However, the database also contains more bizarre and dangerous remedies, such as using dead vultures or goat dung for cures, highlighting the pre-scientific understanding of medicine. Modern medical experts advise against trying these historical treatments, noting the lack of scientific basis and potential for harm.</p>

          <p>Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary, with a new 4K restoration highlighting its enduring legacy. The article explores the film's dark, noir themes and its ahead-of-its-time critique of Hollywood's treatment of aging stars, featuring interviews with 97-year-old cast member Nancy Olson. It also covers the film's successful adaptation into an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, including the recent Tony-winning Broadway revival starring Nicole Scherzinger. The piece reflects on how the story's themes of fame, obsession, and the disposability of talent remain relevant in the entertainment industry today.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While smaller, highly speculative stocks like IonQ have gained attention in the quantum computing space, semiconductor giant Nvidia is quietly building a foundational role in the sector. Through its CUDA-Q software platform, an extension of its dominant AI ecosystem, Nvidia aims to integrate classical and quantum computing, potentially creating a strong technological moat. The article argues that while pure-play quantum stocks trade at extremely high, hype-driven valuations, Nvidia presents a more reasonably valued entry point into the emerging field. This positions Nvidia not just as a chipmaker, but as a strategic, long-term investment in the future of advanced AI applications. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert and self-described introvert Goldie Chan advises that building a personal brand is essential for career advancement, especially for introverted professionals who are often underestimated. A personal brand, defined as what you are known for professionally, allows individuals to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. Chan suggests that introverts can overcome their fear of self-promotion by starting with small, consistent actions, such as sending one networking email a month or posting weekly on a professional platform. She emphasizes that branding is not just an online activity but is also built through offline engagement in communities and hobby groups.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark," prompts a re-examination of the novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic wit obscures her identity as a major modern religious writer. A Catholic convert, Spark's work was deeply influenced by the Book of Job, and she often structured her narratives to mimic the relationship between an omniscient, capricious God and humanity. The article explores how her experiences, from working in British psyops during WWII to a nervous breakdown, shaped her obsession with truth, fiction, and control. Her signature use of "auto-spoilers," revealing a character's fate early on, forced readers to focus on theology and free will rather than simple plot.</p>

          <p>South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min made an impactful debut for Los Angeles FC, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-2 draw against the Chicago Fire.

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly deploying autonomous AI agents to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. These AI "teammates" are designed to automate routine and time-consuming tasks like analyzing alerts, investigating potential threats, and combing through logs, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex work. Companies like ReliaQuest are developing role-based AI agents that can handle tasks such as monitoring executive travel for security risks. While not seen as a replacement for human workers, these agents are becoming a crucial asset for security teams trying to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," engages with the long-standing literary trope of strange and mystical sisters who are perceived as a menace to their community. The novel, set in the 18th century, tells the story of five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, exploring why femininity, especially in a collective form, is often seen as unnatural and threatening. The article analyzes how this trope has functioned historically in works from "Macbeth" to fairy tales, where sisters serve as a test for other characters. While "The Hounding" risks predictable conclusions about misogyny, it powerfully illustrates how ancient fears of female power remain relevant.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a distance that would have shattered the current NFL record. However, because the kick occurred in a preseason match, it will not be officially recorded in the NFL's record books. The current record is a 66-yard field goal made by Baltimore's Justin Tucker in 2021. Despite it not counting officially, the successful kick caused a massive celebration among Little's teammates and demonstrates his powerful leg, suggesting he could be a significant weapon for the team.</p>

          <p>According to an expert who helps Americans move abroad, Albania is emerging as a top overlooked destination in Europe due to its affordability, natural beauty, and welcoming visa policies. Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, a rare advantage that allows for a "test drive" of expat life. The country offers a significantly lower cost of living, with apartments available for under $500 a month, and boasts a growing, friendly expat community. While historically isolated, Albania's stunning Adriatic coastline and rugged mountains are now attracting digital nomads, families, and retirees seeking a high quality of life.</p>

          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing shoppers with a temporary break on state and sometimes local taxes for specific purchases. These events are often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, with eligible items and price limits varying by state. While politically popular, some tax experts argue that these holidays primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their large purchases and that they simply shift consumer spending rather than boosting it. However, for many families facing rising costs, they offer a welcome, if limited, opportunity to save money on essential items.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship that was once part of the British Royal Navy. The ship's hull was exposed after a storm, and researchers have since identified it as the Earl of Chatham, a whaling ship that sank in 1788. Historical records revealed it was formerly the HMS Hind, a naval vessel that served during the American Revolution. The local island community rallied to preserve the 12-ton oak timbers, leading to a remarkable historical find.</p>

          <p>Despite measurable progress in many areas, such as historically low murder rates and fewer deaths from extreme weather, news coverage and public perception often focus overwhelmingly on the negative. This phenomenon is driven by both the media's role as a watchdog and a deep-seated human "negativity bias," an evolutionary trait that prioritizes threats. The article argues that this focus can create a distorted view of the world, breeding cynicism and inaction. Cultivating a sense of "realistic optimism" by acknowledging genuine progress is presented as a necessary tool for building resilience and fostering the belief that major problems are solvable.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. The rock was part of a larger fireball that exploded over the state in June, creating hundreds of sightings. Researchers at the University of Georgia analyzed the fragment and identified it as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite, which allowed them to determine its ancient origins. The object is the 27th meteorite to be recovered in Georgia.</p>
