          <p>President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals and rare earths agreement, envisioning projects worth up to $8.5 billion. The pact includes a planned $1 billion investment from both nations over six months, though a White House fact sheet cited over $3 billion. This framework aims to establish a supply chain independent of China, which currently dominates rare earths processing. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will also provide over $2.2 billion in financing, with a Pentagon investment planned for a gallium refinery in Western Australia, bolstering strategic resource security.

This unfortunate development follows his recent return to the show after an earlier absence caused by illness. Despite these challenges, Dennis and his professional partner, Dianne Buswell, had achieved their highest score of the series in their last performance. The 66-year-old expressed deep gratitude for the opportunity, hoping to eventually dance with his wife once he fully recovers from his injury.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate "non-crime hate incidents," shifting focus to matters meeting the threshold for criminal investigations. This policy change aims to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity, following concerns about policing "toxic culture war debates." The announcement coincided with the Met dropping its probe into Father Ted creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence in X posts, a case that sparked public backlash and free speech debates. Linehan and the Free Speech Union plan to sue the Met for wrongful arrest.</p>

Duffy emphasized the urgency of the "second space race" against China, aiming for a moon return by 2028 with potential new competitors like Blue Origin. Musk quickly retorted on X, questioning Blue Origin's orbital delivery capabilities. This move highlights government pressure on private space companies to meet ambitious timelines and secure national space objectives amidst geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman and venture capitalist David Sacks are publicly sparring over artificial intelligence, particularly regarding AI safety and regulation. Hoffman, an OpenAI investor, defended rival AI startup Anthropic, calling it "one of the good guys" committed to deploying AI thoughtfully and safely. Sacks, serving as President Trump's AI czar, criticized Anthropic for allegedly employing a "regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering." This dispute highlights the intense political and ethical divisions within the AI industry, exacerbated by the tech leaders' differing political affiliations and their influence on policy debates.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese formalized a critical minerals deal at the White House, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on China for essential resources like rare earths.

Beyond minerals, Australia is making substantial defense investments, including purchasing $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles and contributing $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base, reinforcing the AUKUS security alliance against China in the Indo-Pacific region.

          <p>As mortgage interest rates cool, homebuyers and those looking to refinance should be aware of common mistakes to avoid. One error is assuming rates will only continue to fall, as historical data shows fluctuations, making waiting potentially costly. Another is overlooking alternative savings like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for better initial rates. Finally, rigidly adhering to the "1% refinancing rule" can be a misstep, as even smaller rate differences can yield significant savings, provided closing costs are recouped.

          <p>Year-end is a popular time for Roth IRA conversions, where pretax funds are moved to a Roth account for future tax-free growth, incurring upfront taxes. This timing is preferred due to the need for precise current-year income estimates and multi-year tax projections. Financial advisors are closely monitoring tax uncertainties, including potential Affordable Care Act subsidy impacts, which can influence conversion eligibility for younger retirees. While early conversions can start tax-free growth sooner, waiting allows for better income assessment, and strategic conversions during market downturns can also be advantageous.
