          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on primary home sales to stimulate the housing market. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to this tax. The proposal, which follows a similar bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aims to help homeowners, especially seniors in high-value areas, but experts suggest it could be costly and that raising the exemption is a more likely outcome.

          <p>Hasbro has surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, with its digital gaming division's strength offsetting weaknesses in its traditional toy business. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share on $980.8 million in revenue, crediting strong demand for "Magic: The Gathering" and "Monopoly Go!" for the positive results. However, the company recorded a significant net loss due to a $1 billion goodwill impairment and the impact of tariffs, which it is addressing through cost reductions and targeted price increases.

          <p>Alphabet is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting significant growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Investor focus remains on the company's competitive standing in the artificial intelligence space, where it has recently rolled out new products, a venture fund, and made key personnel changes. While its self-driving unit Waymo has achieved milestones, concerns about the impact of AI chatbots on Google's core search business and a recent major cloud outage are also notable factors for the quarter.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, who holds a critical seat for the narrow Republican House majority, stated his decision was based on what is best for his family and district. The announcement follows speculation and a not-so-subtle endorsement for reelection from President Trump, potentially clearing the GOP gubernatorial field for Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has yet to announce her final decision.</p>

The plan focuses on accelerating the build-out of infrastructure like data centers and semiconductor plants, removing what it calls "burdensome AI regulations," and establishing guidelines to prevent "ideological bias" in government-contracted AI systems. It also includes initiatives for AI diplomacy, such as providing AI export packages to American allies to counter competitors like China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have announced the first official reissue of their 1973 duo album, "Buckingham Nicks," which has been out of print for decades. The announcement followed cryptic social media posts that fueled reunion speculation among fans. Recorded shortly before they joined Fleetwood Mac, the album was a commercial failure at the time but has since become a fabled cult classic. The newly remastered version, sourced from the original analog tapes, will be released in September with new liner notes featuring interviews with both artists.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including those from historical greenhouse gas emissions. The non-binding decision is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly the Pacific island states that initiated the case. The court affirmed that countries have a legal obligation to protect the environment from climate harm and that failure to do so could lead to claims for compensation for damages, setting a major precedent for future climate litigation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the increasingly elaborate ways Los Angeles residents treat their dogs, blurring the line between pet and child. From private dog park memberships with alcohol bars to curated meals of steamed rice and chicken, many L.A. "pet parents" spare no expense. The piece highlights several examples, including a dog that frequently flies for business, another with a custom wardrobe, and a senior dog for whom its owners are moving to a single-story home. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift where dogs are considered integral family members.</p>

The announcement provided a boost to Japanese markets, with major auto stocks soaring, and could strengthen the political standing of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully used gene-editing technology to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading the malaria parasite. By making a precise tweak to a single gene, they were able to disrupt the parasite's journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, a crucial step for transmission to humans. The study, published in Nature, also demonstrated that this genetic trait could be rapidly spread through a laboratory population using a gene drive. While the technology is still years from field testing and faces controversy, it represents a promising new tool in the fight against malaria.</p>
