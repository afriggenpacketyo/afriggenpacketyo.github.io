          <p>Alexander Dobrindt, the incoming German interior minister, has expressed skepticism about banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, despite its classification as "extremist" by the spy agency. Dobrindt cited the high legal hurdles required to ban a party, stating that the AfD's activities may not meet the constitutional court's requirements for demonstrating aggressive and combative opposition to democracy. The article also includes comments from SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, who believes that governing effectively is a better strategy for diminishing the AfD's influence, and AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, who accused the outgoing interior minister of using the spy agency as a "secret justice system."</p>
