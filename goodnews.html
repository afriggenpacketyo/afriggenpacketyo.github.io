          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with discussions slated to cover oil, trade, investment deals, and potential policy changes regarding semiconductor exports and nuclear programs. The visit occurs amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, including ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas and negotiations concerning Iran's nuclear program. Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders are expected to attend a Saudi-U.S. investment forum in Riyadh during the visit, with potential announcements of investment deals anticipated. Discussions may also address lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria and renaming the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf, a move likely to anger Iran.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter died at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85, according to a statement from the court. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with liberal justices, frustrating Bush and other Republicans. Souter played a key role in upholding the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) and dissented in Bush v. Gore (2000). His retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, marking a shift in the court's ideological balance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the decline of American manufacturing, a significant majority of Americans express a desire to see more citizens employed in factory jobs, fueled by cultural nostalgia and political incentives. While factory work is often romanticized as a source of good, solid jobs, the reality is that manufacturing salaries have fallen in the bottom half of all jobs, and unionization rates have declined. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have advocated for revitalizing American manufacturing, citing national security concerns and the potential for supporting a strong labor base. However, the desire to bring back factory jobs may not align with the reality of American manufacturing today, as automation and productivity growth have reduced the need for human labor in the production process.</p>

          <p>The former SoHo home and studio of conceptual artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, where they lived and worked for approximately 50 years, remains largely unchanged since their deaths. The Christo and Jeanne-Claude Foundation uses the building as its office, but the possibility of opening the home to the public is being explored, which could mean making structural updates. The couple, known for their massive, site-specific installations, never accepted money from sponsors, financing their own projects to remain independent and avoid commercial influence. The foundation wants to find a way to keep their legacy alive, preserving the space where they lived and worked, as the inception of their grand, internationally known works happened humbly in the building.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, could crash anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, encompassing a vast area including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia. While the risk to humans is considered low due to the planet's large water coverage, there is a slight chance that the 1,000-pound object will survive reentry, as it was built to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus' atmosphere.</p>

As the U.S. and China prepare to engage in crucial trade discussions, the Swiss president expressed hope that the talks would lead to a resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apartment renters are showing less inclination to move when their leases expire, with turnover rates significantly lower than the industry norm. This trend is attributed to factors like the unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, and a shift towards suburban apartments. Landlords are benefiting from this situation through better pricing on renewals and reduced turnover costs. Analysts favor multifamily REITs with a strong presence on the West Coast, while remaining neutral on the Sunbelt due to potential recession-related job losses.</p>

          <p>The recent trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. indicates that President Trump's 10% tariffs are likely to remain a standard practice for trading partners. Despite the U.K.'s special relationship with the U.S., it was unable to persuade Trump to eliminate all tariffs. While some sectors, such as British steelmakers and the aluminum industry, will be able to export tariff-free, the 10% baseline tariff will apply to most other goods. Trump suggested that the 10% baseline is a low number and that tariffs could be much higher for countries with significant trade surpluses.</p>
