          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned for his mother, Sally Challen's release from prison after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer, after decades of coercive control. A law passed in 2015, which recognizes psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse, helped secure Mrs. Challen's release from prison after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David has written a book, called 'The Unthinkable', about his family's experiences to help others, highlighting the need for greater awareness and protection for victims of domestic abuse. He described normalizing the coercion and control in his home, as well as the sexual violence his mother endured.</p>

          <p>An international study found that regular exercise during the three years following colon cancer treatment can significantly improve survival rates. Colon cancer patients who participated in a structured exercise program were 28% less likely to experience a recurrence of cancer and had a 37% higher overall survival rate after eight years. The exercise group engaged in moderate-intensity activities for 2 ¬Ω hours per week, guided by coaches. Researchers suggest that exercise should be considered a standard treatment for colon cancer, as it could be remarkably cost-effective compared to new cancer drugs.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial found that blood tests could identify drug-defying breast cancers early, enabling women to switch drugs without waiting for scans showing cancer progression. This approach improved their quality of life by allowing for earlier intervention. The study highlights the potential of blood tests to personalize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes. These findings may lead to more effective and less burdensome treatment strategies for women with breast cancer.</p>
