          <p>SpaceX successfully conducted a crucial test flight of its Starship rocket, the world's largest and most powerful, marking a significant turnaround after a series of prior failures. The 60-minute flight from Texas saw the Super Heavy booster separate and execute a successful "chopstick" catch, while the Starship spacecraft reached nearly 200km altitude, enduring intense stress during descent. This achievement is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship to send humans to the Moon by 2027, and advances Elon Musk's ambitious vision for a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying people to the Moon and Mars, despite the 2027 Moon landing date likely slipping.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Reddit post unveiled a family dispute centered on a grandmother's controversial advice to feed her 6-month-old grandchild a stick of butter, advocating for a "carnivore baby" diet. The mother-in-law expressed disapproval of the baby's fruit consumption, citing concerns about "sugar addiction," and promoted a meat-based nutritionist's views. Health experts acknowledge the crucial role of healthy fats and protein in infant development but emphasize the necessity of a broad, nutrient-dense diet that includes a variety of plant-based foods. They suggest incorporating butter into cooked foods rather than offering it directly, aiming for a balanced approach to infant nutrition.</p>

          <p>The United States, through a collaboration between the RTX Technology Research Centre and Pratt & Whitney, is actively progressing its rotating detonation engine (RDE) program, now entering a practical validation phase after a decade of intensive design and testing. RDEs are considered a "game-changing" technology due to their highly efficient combustion process, which utilizes sustained, high-speed detonation waves to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. This innovative method promises to create more compact, lightweight, and significantly more efficient engines. The ultimate goal is their integration into advanced weapon systems, underscoring a critical and competitive technological race between global powers like the US and China.</p>

          <h2>Gold Prices Poised for Potential Rise in Fall 2025 Amidst Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices, having surged to unprecedented levels earlier this year before a recent pullback, are currently experiencing a holding pattern but are forecast for a potential increase in fall 2025. Experts predict a "bull case" scenario where gold could reach approximately $4,000 per ounce by year-end, primarily driven by expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate reductions, a weakening dollar, and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, all of which historically enhance gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. Conversely, a strengthening economy, a firming dollar, or the maintenance of higher long-term yields could potentially suppress price growth, although a substantial price drop is not widely anticipated by analysts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel experienced substantial public outcry and a subsequent nearly $100 million drop in market value after introducing a new logo that eliminated the familiar "Uncle Herschel" character. In response to the widespread criticism, which notably included a public statement from President Trump, the company promptly reversed its decision, choosing to reinstate its original, beloved design. Branding experts identified the core error as a significant deviation from Cracker Barrel's deeply ingrained "brand story" and the strong emotional ties customers held with its distinctive folksy, homestyle image. This incident underscores the inherent risks associated with altering a legacy brand's fundamental identity without a thorough understanding of consumer and stakeholder sentiment.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth for the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5%, yet the company exceeded Wall Street expectations thanks to a strong 19% surge from its teen-focused Hollister brand. Despite the overall positive performance and raised full-year revenue outlook, shares fell due to a weaker profit outlook and increased tariff costs, nearly doubling to $90 million. The company is actively pursuing new categories and international expansion, alongside strategic partnerships like becoming the NFL's official fashion partner, to sustain growth amidst a challenging retail environment.

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington D.C. crime data reveals a significant nearly 50% reduction in violent crime over the three weeks subsequent to President Trump's deployment of federal troops and law enforcement agents. The study determined that these deployments were strategically placed in areas with higher crime rates, with overall crime incidents near federal locations being almost three times the citywide average. While the White House highlights over 1,000 arrests and numerous firearm seizures, some local leaders, including D.C. Council members, voiced concerns that the substantial federal presence is unsettling residents and negatively impacting local businesses, despite the reported decrease in criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand and interest rates remained largely unchanged last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.69%. While refinance applications saw a slight dip, purchase applications increased by 2%, marking the strongest week for home purchase demand in a month, albeit from a low base. This modest rise is attributed to prospective buyers becoming less rate-sensitive, alongside increased inventory and cooling home price growth. The stability in rates persisted despite President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an event that could potentially lead to more aggressive interest rate cuts in the future.

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose experienced a significant jump of over 15% in premarket trading following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received multiple bids to take the luxury winter-clothing manufacturer private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International are among those who have reportedly submitted verbal offers, which value the company at approximately $1.35 billion based on its 12-month average earnings. Although this potential valuation remains considerably below its 2018 peak, the prospective deal signifies a substantial return for Bain Capital, which initially gained control in 2013, and highlights robust private equity interest in the brand despite recent fluctuations in its public stock performance.

This article illuminates the pervasive trend of "intensive parenting," where even leisure travel transforms into a goal-oriented endeavor, aiming to cultivate empathy and resilience through exposure to diverse cultures and experiences. Despite the considerable financial strain and inherent logistical challenges of traveling with young children, many parents perceive these "micro-adventures" as essential for personal growth and forging enduring family memories, even if they occasionally find themselves needing a vacation from the vacation itself.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the unique inheritance custom of "chiro bash," also known as ultimogeniture, which is observed in Pakistan's remote Chitral district, where the youngest son traditionally inherits the family home. This practice, potentially originating in the seventh century, serves to ensure that parents receive care in their old age and helps to maintain family continuity within the village, with older siblings usually assisted in establishing their own independent households. While some view this tradition as equitable, it can occasionally lead to familial friction, and women within families sometimes contest it by invoking Islamic law, which prescribes a more equal division of estates among siblings. With growing urbanization and the increasing prevalence of formal Shariah-based inheritance laws, the long-term survival of this ancient custom appears uncertain.</p>
