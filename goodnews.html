          <p>China’s domestically built AS700 crewed airship successfully completed a crucial flight test, soaring at an altitude of 1,200 meters over the world’s highest bridge. This significant test verified the airship’s suitability for low-altitude operations, with collected flight data informing future improvements for broader applications. State broadcaster CCTV reported that these positive results lay the groundwork for future deployment in essential missions such as emergency rescue, aerial surveillance, and tailored flight support. The AS700, boasting a maximum altitude of 3,100 meters, represents a notable advancement in China’s developing aviation technology. (not investment advice)</p>

Miraculously, no injuries were reported despite the extensive damage and debris scattered across Alexander Avenue. Initial investigations suggest the blast occurred as the heating system was being activated for the season, sending shockwaves up the chimney. Mayor Eric Adams praised the rapid response, emphasizing the avoidance of a major disaster. Residents of 38 apartments were evacuated, and inspections are ongoing to ensure the building's structural integrity. (not investment advice)</p>
