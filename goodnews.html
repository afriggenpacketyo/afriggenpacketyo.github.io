          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, offers renewed hope in China's drive to reduce its reliance on Dutch giant ASML for crucial chipmaking machines. As a spin-off from state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims to commercialize advanced lithography equipment more swiftly, addressing a significant bottleneck in China's semiconductor ambitions. The country still lags global leaders in this technology and faces restrictions on acquiring top-tier systems due to US export controls, making domestic innovation vital. This strategic move underscores China's persistent efforts towards technological self-sufficiency amidst global tech tensions, potentially reshaping the future of its chip industry.</p>

          <p>China’s biggest airlines have begun offering free Wi-Fi on a growing number of domestic flights, a strategic move to win back business travelers who increasingly prefer high-speed trains for inter-city travel. China Eastern Airlines launched a free "basic" Wi-Fi service on all its widebody aircraft, covering 37 routes connecting major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Competitors Air China and China Southern Airlines also provide free Wi-Fi on a portion of their domestic flights. This enhancement aims to facilitate "work from the air" and has garnered positive customer feedback, reflecting a competitive push to attract and retain passengers with improved in-flight amenities.</p>

          <p>The Spanish town of Terrassa in Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters during the Halloween period, from October 6 to November 10. This precautionary measure aims to protect the felines from potential harm or use as props in "sinister rituals," as adoption requests for black cats typically increase around this time. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque confirmed the decision, taken after warnings from animal welfare groups, despite no recorded cruelty cases in Terrassa itself. The city council emphasizes this is an exceptional, temporary measure to ensure animal welfare, reflecting a broader concern for animals often associated with superstitions.</p>

          <p>The China-Laos railway, dubbed the "potassium railway," has become a critical conduit for China to secure potassium, a strategic resource vital for agricultural production, significantly bolstering its confidence in trade negotiations with Western nations.
