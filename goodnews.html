        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fitness expert emphasizes the importance of strength training for older adults to combat age-related muscle decline, which he calls crucial for longevity and preventing injuries. He outlines six fundamental pillars of movement: push, pull, carry, hinge, overhead press, and squat, which together create a functional fitness routine. The article advises starting slowly, combining strength work with cardiovascular activity and mobility, and notes that exercises like resistance band training can be done at home.</p>

          <p>A couple recounts their decision to sell 90% of their belongings and live a nomadic lifestyle across ten different U.S. cities for two years, breaking free from a monotonous routine. This experience taught them the value of minimalism, the importance of embracing new experiences over static habits, and how to live on a smaller budget, which ultimately allowed them to save money. The journey not only strengthened their relationship by forcing them to navigate challenges together but also deepened their individual sense of self and adventure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals who have accumulated more retirement savings than needed, financial advisors recommend several safe investment strategies to ensure the surplus funds continue to grow. A primary consideration is the tax implication; placing extra money into tax-sheltered accounts like a 401(k), including catch-up contributions, can offset taxes on earnings from taxable accounts like high-yield savings. The choice between taxable and tax-sheltered accounts depends on one's current tax bracket and financial goals, whether for legacy planning, philanthropy, or emergency use.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the narrative, promoted by movements like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again," that the current generation is the "sickest" in U.S. history. It presents evidence of significant public health progress, noting that life expectancy has nearly doubled since the late 19th century due to advances like vaccines, cleaner environments, and safer workplaces. While acknowledging modern health issues like obesity and chronic diseases, the piece argues that past generations faced far worse conditions, such as high infant mortality and rampant infectious diseases, putting today's problems in a broader, more optimistic perspective.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is pressuring Performance Food Group (PFG) to consider a merger with its competitor, US Foods. Sachem Head has nominated four new candidates for PFG's board, arguing that a combination could unlock between $800 million and $1 billion in synergies, based on a previous attempt by Sysco to acquire US Foods. The firm, which has a successful track record of activism at US Foods, believes the current regulatory environment under the Trump administration is more favorable for such a deal than in the past.

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH) have risen nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake in the company in mid-August, but the investment may not yet be profitable. Berkshire purchased over 5 million shares during the second quarter, a period when the stock's price fluctuated significantly. Depending on the exact purchase price within that range, the investment could be either in the red or showing a substantial gain, with analysis of the average price suggesting it may still be slightly down.

          <p>Food-focused convenience store chains like Wawa and Casey's are increasingly winning over breakfast customers from traditional fast-food restaurants. While morning traffic to fast-food chains grew by only 1%, it surged by 9% for these convenience stores in a recent three-month period, according to market research firm Circana. This trend is driven by expanded fresh food offerings, perceived value, and the convenience of grabbing a meal while fueling up, posing a significant challenge to giants like McDonald's, which has acknowledged breakfast as its weakest and most economically sensitive daypart.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece laments the cyclical nature of fashion trends, specifically the apparent comeback of skinny jeans, a style many had abandoned. The author expresses frustration with the fashion industry and media, which he argues constantly pressure consumers to buy new versions of items they were told to discard just years earlier. He rejects the notion of following trends like the "Regular Millennial Guy Look," arguing for developing a personal style independent of the industry's profit-driven cycle and its often uncomfortable and impractical demands.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's significant financial commitments are a major driver of growth in the tech sector, with Oracle being the latest beneficiary, experiencing a historic stock surge after revealing large contracts with the AI company. This follows a similar boost for chipmaker Broadcom and contributes to the sustained market value increases for key partners like Microsoft and Nvidia. OpenAI is reportedly set to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years, a figure that has massively expanded Oracle's backlog but also raises concerns about the concentration of risk with a single, cash-burning startup.

          <p>According to Google Flights, the most effective strategy for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel dates and times. Data analysis shows that flying midweek—on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is typically 13% cheaper than flying on weekends, which can save travelers an average of $42 per domestic ticket. The article debunks the myth that the day of the week a ticket is purchased matters significantly, emphasizing instead that the day of travel is the crucial factor. Traveling during a destination's shoulder or off-season can also lead to substantial savings.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine has become more challenging this year, as the FDA has narrowed approval to specific high-risk groups, such as those 65 and older or with certain medical conditions. This change from previous universal eligibility means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies unless they can "self-attest" to having a risk factor. The article provides a list of qualifying conditions and clarifies that while insurance coverage is currently uncertain pending CDC recommendations, supply of the vaccine is not expected to be an issue.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has dissolved the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a panel of climate change skeptics whose report was widely criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science. The group's report was used by the EPA to support rolling back regulations on climate pollution. Environmental groups had sued the administration, alleging the secret formation of the one-sided panel violated federal law. Wright claimed the group's purpose of catalyzing debate was fulfilled, though critics argue it merely sowed doubt on settled science.</p>
