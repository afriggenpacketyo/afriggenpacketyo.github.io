          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open championship at Royal Portrush, finishing with a commanding four-stroke lead. This victory marks his fourth major title and his second of the 2025 season, solidifying his position as the world's number one golfer. With this win, Scheffler is now only one major away—the U.S. Open—from completing the coveted career Grand Slam. He joins an elite group including Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30.</p>

He landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, earning a Bronze Star for his service. In his final years, he became a beloved figure, known for his charm, humor, and powerful message of "make peace not war," leaving a legacy of remembrance and connection.</p>

          <h2>Scheffler Remains Humble After Open Victory, Downplaying Comparisons to Tiger Woods</h2>

          <p>Despite his dominant Open Championship win and growing comparisons to Tiger Woods, Scottie Scheffler remains grounded, insisting he is not "anything special." He emphasized that while winning is a "cool feeling," it is his family and faith that provide true fulfillment, not his on-course achievements. Scheffler dismissed the parallels with Woods as "silly," pointing out he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major championship total. He shared his joy at celebrating with his wife and young son, Bennett, expressing hope that his son will one day enjoy the life lessons taught by golf.</p>

          <p>Officials have significantly reduced the number of individuals listed as missing following the catastrophic floods in Texas Hill Country, with the count now down to three from a high of over 160. This sharp decrease is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, who verified that many initially reported missing were safe. The historic flash floods, which killed at least 135 people, devastated the region, particularly along the Guadalupe River. Recovery efforts are ongoing as Texas lawmakers prepare to address flood-related issues, including improving early warning systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what is now considered discredited evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had "unanswered questions for over 40 years." Campaigners, who have long sought justice, expressed cautious elation at the news, hoping to finally uncover the truth.</p>

The moment became an internet sensation, prompting memes and discussion. Martin's lighthearted comment appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the viral event, adding a layer of self-awareness to the fan-interactive concert segment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is "self-connection," the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem later in life. To foster this crucial skill, she advises parents to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. These small shifts help build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, providing a strong foundation for mental health.</p>
