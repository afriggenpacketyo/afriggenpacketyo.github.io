          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B in a lawsuit brought by a security guard who accused her of assault in 2018. The guard, Emani Ellis, sought $24 million in damages, claiming the rapper spat on her and cut her with a fingernail during an altercation at a Beverly Hills medical building. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, contended that the guard was filming her against her wishes and invading her privacy. The jury sided with the artist, absolving her of any financial liability in the case.</p>

          <p>Following a market downturn, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the companies they own for long-term success. He attributed the decline to routine profit-taking in major tech stocks, noting that September is historically a challenging month for the market. Cramer also pointed to investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and anticipation for the upcoming labor report as contributing factors. He recommended holding onto strong growth stocks like Nvidia and Apple, cautioning against making reactive decisions based on a single day's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales may reshape the landscape of left-wing politics in the United Kingdom. His blunt, digitally-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other factions. Polanski's alignment with figures like Jeremy Corbyn could lead to either collaboration or competition for the same voter base, potentially cannibalizing support among progressive groups. This leadership change raises questions about whether the party will maintain the broad coalition that led to recent electoral successes or pivot to a more narrow, left-wing focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.3 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the game's history. While the odds of winning are 1 in 292.2 million, the take-home amount varies significantly depending on the winner's state of residence due to differing tax laws. States like California and Florida do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of the prize after federal taxes. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout for the winner. This drawing is the 41st since the last jackpot was won in May.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged after a federal judge issued remedies in its landmark antitrust case that were less severe than investors had feared. While finding Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Department of Justice's demand to force a sale of the Chrome browser. Instead, the ruling focuses on ending exclusive default-search-engine contracts and requiring Google to share some search data with rivals. The decision was viewed as a significant win for the tech giant, alleviating concerns about a forced break-up of its core assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle. Initially, the vehicles will operate with human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually control the cars while collecting data to validate the technology for future fully autonomous services. This expansion follows the successful launch of commercial driverless ride-hailing operations in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr vehicles, marking another step in Waymo's strategy for nationwide deployment.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed legislation would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, and online stores, targeting drinks like Red Bull and Prime. This move addresses growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative effects of excessive caffeine consumption on young people, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. While many supermarkets have a voluntary ban, this law would make the restriction mandatory to protect youth health.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of forcing a breakup of the company. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google must end its exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices and must also share some of its valuable search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the Department of Justice's most severe proposal to compel the sale of the Chrome web browser, stating a divestiture was not justified. The decision marks a major moment in tech regulation, aiming to curb Google's monopoly power without dismantling its core operations.</p>
