          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman now recommends that investors consider allocating 10% to 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a substantial increase from his previous advice of a low single-digit percentage. He attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto market, with increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity resolving earlier uncertainties. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto essential for long-term growth.

          <p>World Cup-winning French forward Olivier Giroud is set to leave Los Angeles FC after the club mutually agreed to terminate his contract. Giroud, who joined from AC Milan with high expectations, had an inconsistent tenure, scoring six goals across two partial seasons. While he had memorable moments, including helping LAFC win its first U.S. Open Cup, he did not become the consistent offensive force the team had hoped for. His departure opens a valuable Designated Player spot for the club to pursue a new star signing.</p>
