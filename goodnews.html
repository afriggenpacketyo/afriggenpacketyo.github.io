          <p>Citizens of the Republic of Ireland are voting to elect their next president, a largely ceremonial but constitutionally significant role, for a seven-year term. The main contest is between independent candidate Catherine Connolly, who is backed by a coalition of left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys of the governing center-right party, Fine Gael. The election follows the completion of President Michael D. Higgins's two terms in office. The race has been notable for the withdrawal of several other candidates, including one amid a rent controversy.</p>

The regional rally was largely driven by positive investor sentiment following the White House's confirmation that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold talks next week. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed 1.35%, supported by the optimistic geopolitical outlook. Meanwhile, South Korea's finance ministry stated it is prepared to intervene to stabilize its currency, the won, amid recent volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant political upset, Plaid Cymru has won the Senedd by-election in Caerphilly, a constituency held by the Labour Party for over a century. The victory for Plaid's candidate, Lindsay Whittle, is being interpreted as a potential sign of shifting voter sentiment ahead of next year's Welsh Parliament election. The result is a major blow to Labour, whose vote share plummeted to 11%, raising concerns about their standing across Wales. Reform UK, despite high expectations, finished second, falling short of their ambition to become a dominant force in Welsh politics.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.5% in September, marking the fourth straight month of growth and defying forecasts of a slight decrease. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the unexpected strength to strong consumer demand for gold, purchased online, and new technology products like the Nintendo Switch 2 and iPhone 17. This positive economic indicator comes amid broader concerns about a potential slowdown in the British economy. Analysts suggest that interest rate cuts and above-inflation pay increases may be boosting consumer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has stated his wish to remain at Barcelona permanently after his current loan agreement concludes. The Spanish club holds a £28 million option to buy the 27-year-old England international, a fee reportedly lower than what Manchester United would ask from other clubs. Rashford, who has found revived form at Barcelona with five goals in 12 games, indicated that a change of scenery was needed after spending his entire career at Old Trafford. His future at Manchester United appears uncertain under head coach Ruben Amorim.</p>

The readout also reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to strengthening its manufacturing base and achieving significant leaps in economic and national defense capabilities by 2035, signaling a continued push for resilience.

          <p>A research team in China has developed an ultra-thin, flexible metasurface material designed to enhance the stealth capabilities of aircraft. The new coating, detailed in the journal Advanced Materials, is only 0.1 mm thick and can withstand extreme temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its key feature is a tunable impedance, which allows it to effectively absorb electromagnetic waves, making it highly suitable for aerospace applications. The breakthrough was led by researchers from Peking University and Harbin Engineering University, building on previous work in large-scale graphene production.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's exceptional defensive record, having conceded only three goals in their first eight games, is drawing comparisons to some of the best defenses in Premier League history. This defensive solidity has propelled them to the top of the table and may be their most viable path to winning the title for the first time since 2004. While their attack has been less prolific than in previous seasons, their current rate of conceding goals is on pace to break the record set by Chelsea's 2004-05 title-winning team. The article explores whether this defensive prowess alone can be enough to secure the championship.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators at the recent "No Kings" rallies protesting the Trump administration have adopted a unique tactic: wearing inflatable animal costumes. The trend, which includes frogs, dinosaurs, and unicorns, began in Portland as a way to use absurdist humor to counter the narrative that the protesters are violent radicals. Organizers say the costumes make the demonstrations feel less threatening and are designed to make any government use of force appear farcical. The tactic aims to publicize a political message in a way that highlights the perceived authoritarianism of the administration's response to dissent.</p>
