          <p>The well-preserved body of St. Teresa of Jesus, a 16th-century Catholic saint, was put on public display in Alba de Tormes, Spain, for the first time since 1914. Catholics were visibly moved by the display, with some observers crying and praying at the sight of the Spanish saint. The body, dressed in a nun's habit, appeared mostly skeletal but with certain areas, including her foot, remarkably well-preserved. Experts noted the saint's 'perfectly preserved' condition, attributing it to the dry atmosphere of her tomb, and highlighting the serenity it transmits even after more than 400 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's initial decision to impose triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products caused significant disruption to global trade, but ultimately proved unsustainable. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in an agreement to reduce levies on both sides, lowering the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30% and China's tariff on American goods to 10%. While this provided relief to businesses, it also raised questions about whether the trade disruptions were worth it, as China made no immediate concessions beyond agreeing to further talks. The article emphasizes the limitations of Trump's aggressive trade approach and the shared interest in avoiding a complete decoupling of the two economies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration has enlisted Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess costs and progress on the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The project's estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion, raising concerns about efficiency. This article highlights potential conflicts of interest given Musk's various business ventures and his role as an advisor to President Trump. The Department of Transportation confirmed that the Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted, aiming to find ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) has lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January due to accusations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal Palestinian affairs. The ban had been indefinite, pending Al Jazeera correcting its legal status, but PA officials have now decided to lift it without specifying any changes. This article notes that the PA, dominated by the Fatah party, has long been at odds with Al Jazeera, accusing the channel of supporting Hamas. The reversal follows similar actions by Israeli authorities, who also ordered Al Jazeera to shut down and stormed its offices.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that a new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport after a telecommunications line failed. This article explains that the update ensured the backup system worked, but controllers stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution due to previous outages. Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not better equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia and announced plans to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system.
