          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's attempts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Following his release, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating that his release demonstrates the Trump administration's losing legal battle to deport migrants who advocate for Palestinians. Khalil's release comes after a judge determined he was not a flight risk or threat to his community, although the Trump administration plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that could have deprived universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding. The universities argued that the move threatened critical work in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and semiconductors. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, protecting research projects that examine AI and the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, known for his value investing approach, has been a net seller of stocks for ten consecutive quarters, accumulating a record level of cash at Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's caution stems from high S&P 500 valuations, with the Shiller CAPE ratio reaching levels seen only twice before, suggesting expensive stock prices. This conservative stance may indicate a potential market correction or shift, as Buffett typically seeks undervalued opportunities. His recent moves suggest he may be positioning Berkshire Hathaway for future investment opportunities amidst market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
