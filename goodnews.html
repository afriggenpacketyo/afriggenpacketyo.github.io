          <p>Uber and Waymo have expanded their partnership by launching a robotaxi service in Atlanta, covering approximately 65 square miles but excluding highways and the airport. This service utilizes Waymo's driverless technology integrated into electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs and operates without human supervisors on board, contrasting with Tesla's pilot robotaxi service in Austin, which includes a human valet. Waymo's expansion into Atlanta follows its launch in Austin and signifies the company's growing presence in the autonomous vehicle market, aiming to compete with Tesla and Chinese companies like Baidu's Apollo Go. Uber's stock experienced an 8% increase following the announcement, highlighting investor confidence in the partnership and the potential of robotaxi services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs warrants a cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Powell noted the difficulty in predicting how much of the tariff inflation will be passed on to consumers, emphasizing the Fed's wait-and-see approach. Despite pressure from President Trump for faster rate cuts, the Fed has maintained its current stance, citing low employment and decent economic growth as reasons to hold steady, though some governors have expressed openness to considering rate cuts as early as July. Powell highlighted that the Fed expects a meaningful increase in inflation this year, further justifying the current policy, but mentioned that the summer data should provide more clarity on consumer price responses to tariffs.

While the 2% target is not legally binding, political pressure from leaders like President Trump has pushed many countries to increase their spending, with some, including Canada, Belgium, Portugal and Italy, planning to meet the target soon.

          <p>Iresha Picot, a therapist in Philadelphia, created the Black Girl Joy Bike Ride in 2023 to provide Black women with a space for self-care, community, and joy. Recognizing that Black women are often conditioned to prioritize others' needs, Picot organizes weekly bike rides through the city, offering a chance to reclaim peace and build friendships. The initiative provides bikes for those in need and creates a supportive environment where women can prioritize themselves and their well-being, seeing the city in a new light.</p>
