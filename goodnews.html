          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) students the centuries-old tradition of indigo and natural dyeing. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang, who grew tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry, emphasizes indigo's cultural significance and medicinal benefits. Students are working on final projects that showcase the skills they've learned, appreciating the sustainability and historical process involved in natural dyeing. Chang also wrote a children's book, "My Indigo World," to honor her ancestors and share the science and history behind indigo dye.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, reported revenue exceeding expectations in its first earnings release since going public, with revenue soaring 420% year-over-year. The company also projected faster growth for the year, expecting revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. This growth is attributed to new clients and increased demand for infrastructure, including a significant deal with OpenAI. Despite the positive revenue, CoreWeave's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs, and the stock price initially dipped before stabilizing. Management is confident in the company's future, emphasizing its diversification and the increasing reliance on its services across various sectors.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum wage increase for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from the tourism industry about potential job losses and economic impacts. The proposal, hailed by labor leaders as the highest minimum wage in the country, also requires hotels and airport businesses to provide $8.35 per hour for healthcare. Opponents argue the wage increase will lead to staffing cuts and discourage future investments in the city, while supporters contend it will benefit workers and the local economy. The measure now requires a second vote due to the lack of unanimous approval.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite budget challenges, California Governor Gavin Newsom has committed to maintaining state-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants. This decision comes as Congress considers a bill that would penalize states for providing such coverage. Newsom acknowledged the economic impact of undocumented immigrants and defended the state's expansion of healthcare, citing long-term cost savings. However, the budget shortfall may force cuts in coverage, including capping enrollment and adding monthly premiums. While some criticize the rollbacks, Newsom emphasized the state's continued support for its vulnerable residents.</p>
