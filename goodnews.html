          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially become Thailand's new prime minister, following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His appointment marks a shift in power, ousting the Shinawatra dynasty's allied Pheu Thai party, whose leader was recently dismissed by a court order. Anutin, known for championing cannabis decriminalization and managing the country's COVID-19 response, secured his position with support from the main opposition, promising to serve with honesty for the nation's benefit.</p>

          <p>The US Open tennis tournament has evolved beyond a traditional sporting event into a large-scale cultural and commercial festival, akin to Coachella. The article details how the experience is increasingly defined by high-priced concessions, influencer marketing, and celebrity appearances, which are meticulously managed to maximize social media engagement. This shift has expanded the tournament's footprint and economic impact, turning it into a month-long spectacle where the branding and social performance of attending are as central as the tennis itself. While this strategy has boosted attendance to record levels, it also raises questions about the changing nature of fan experience.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London. He is accused of planting two bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with attacks claimed by an animal rights extremist group. After a high-speed chase in 2003, he vanished, abandoning a car that former FBI agents described as a "bomb-making lab." San Diego was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales last year, and the US is now seeking his return to face trial.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur on Sunday evening, offering sky-watchers in the UK a chance to see the full Moon turn a reddish hue, an event often called a "Blood Moon." The spectacle happens when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest views. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon to witness the celestial event, which requires no special eye protection.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, the 24-year-old founder of water filtration company Water2, has seen his business grow rapidly since its 2023 launch, attracting adventurer Bear Grylls as both a customer and now a co-owner. After dropping out of university, Robinson used profits from a hand sanitizer venture to develop a self-installable water filter, leveraging authentic social media videos to build a direct-to-consumer brand. The company, which aims to reduce exposure to chemicals and microplastics in tap water, has sold its product to 180,000 homes and is projected to be in 1% of all UK households by year's end.</p>

          <p>Shaun Cassidy, a prominent teen idol from the 1970s, is returning to the stage for his first major arena tour since 1980. Now 66, Cassidy has spent recent decades as a successful television writer and producer but is now relearning his own hit songs on guitar and bass for the 50-city tour. He revealed that because he hasn't performed the songs in so long, they feel new to him, and he believes his voice is stronger now than it was in his youth. The tour will feature a mix of his classic music, new material, and personal stories from his varied career.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani at a town hall in Brooklyn, framing the campaign as a crucial fight against oligarchic control in the U.S. The event drew a large crowd, where both politicians condemned corporate greed and billionaire influence in politics. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement and questioned why mainstream Democratic leaders have not fully supported him. Mamdani, a progressive favorite, reiterated his platform of freezing rents and raising taxes on the wealthy, vowing that New York City is "not for sale."</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a decisive 59-20 victory over Georgia Southern in a game that served as a reunion with former coach Clay Helton.

Quarterback Jayden Maiava threw for a career-high 412 yards and four touchdowns before backups entered the game, while the rushing attack added over 300 yards. While the defense showed some vulnerabilities by allowing several big plays, the offensive firepower ensured a comfortable win for the Trojans.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from the US and China has developed an innovative method for launching tiny robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material on a wet surface, which boils water droplets and creates bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects nearly five feet into the air. This technique could provide a new, efficient mechanism for propulsion in micro-robotics.</p>
