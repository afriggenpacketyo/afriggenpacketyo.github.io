          <p>Toyota is redesigning its all-electric vehicle, previously known as the bZ4X, and renaming it the "bZ" for the 2026 model year to simplify branding and distance itself from the original model's criticisms. The bZ4X received negative reviews and faced a recall due to potential wheel detachment issues. Toyota aims to address these concerns with the updated bZ, promising a 25% increase in EV range, a 50% improvement in horsepower, and enhanced fast-charging capabilities. The redesign reflects Toyota's commitment to improving its EV offerings and addressing past shortcomings.</p>
