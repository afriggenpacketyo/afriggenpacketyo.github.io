        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office is contemplating restricting visa applications from countries such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, aiming to reduce asylum claims made by individuals who initially enter the UK on work or study visas. Ministers believe some individuals abuse the system by switching to asylum claims shortly after arriving, seeking permanent residency. While the Home Office has not released recent exit check statistics, they plan to release a comprehensive immigration white paper outlining strategies to restore order to the immigration system. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer has also pledged to reduce both legal and illegal migration, focusing on criminalizing actions that endanger lives at sea and developing training programs to decrease reliance on migrant workers.</p>

          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, reaffirming its full-year projections despite macroeconomic and tariff concerns. The company's revenues decreased by 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, totaling 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), surpassing analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to decreased demand in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China, due to an uncertain consumer outlook. Despite these challenges, CEO Daniel Grieder confirmed the company's 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros.</p>

          <p>DoorDash's acquisition of Deliveroo exemplifies the contrasting fortunes of US and UK stock markets, with DoorDash's offer valuing Deliveroo at ¬£2.9 billion. The deal underscores a broader trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange in favor of US listings, driven by higher valuations and greater access to capital. Despite efforts to make the UK market more attractive, such as the "Edinburgh Reforms," UK stocks continue to lag behind their US counterparts in terms of demand and valuation. The article suggests that companies listed in the US can more easily amass financial resources for expansion and acquisitions.</p>

          <p>China's Labour Day holiday saw a rebound in tourism, with visitor numbers surpassing pre-pandemic levels, though spending per head showed stagnation as travelers opted for less traditional destinations. While tourism and retail sales improved, a housing crisis and a nationwide trade-in program for consumer goods create mixed signals for China's economy. The article notes that per capita tourism revenue remained below pre-pandemic levels, and low price sub-indices indicate persistent deflationary pressure and continued consumption downgrading, amidst a trade war with the United States.</p>

          <p>After 20 years, the REAL ID deadline has arrived, requiring states to issue IDs that are harder to counterfeit and verify the information they contain. The law, intended to avoid a national ID card, faced resistance from states citing cost, privacy, and documentation burdens. As a result, there are various "flavors" of REAL ID, with most states using a star symbol to indicate compliance. Millions have yet to apply for REAL ID versions, and the system is now under attack from the Trump Administration, which is pressuring states that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status.</p>

While prices may increase, Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and competitive pricing are expected to allow them to maintain a strong presence.

While the offer price of 180p per share represents a 44% increase on Deliveroo's share price from when takeover talks became public, it is significantly below the 390p share price at its initial public offering in 2021. The acquisition is seen as another example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm.</p>
