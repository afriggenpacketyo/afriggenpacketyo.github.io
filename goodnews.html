          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 00:14:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Thursday, tracking a significant tech rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic fears persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable increase, though shares of Nidec Corp plummeted after the company announced an investigation into alleged improper accounting within its group. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also climbed, supported by a 0.5% month-on-month rise in household spending in July, marking the fastest annual growth since November 2023. Meanwhile, global bond markets remained a focal point, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% for the first time since July, and Japan's 30-year bond yield reaching a record high due to inflation and political uncertainty.

          <p>Jannik Sinner, the defending US Open champion, showcased dominant form by sweeping past fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti with a decisive 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the semi-finals in New York. Sinner, who was recently dubbed an "artificial intelligence" player, maintained his scintillating performance, hitting 28 winners while Musetti failed to convert any of his seven break points. The top seed secured crucial breaks in the second and third sets, closing out the match just before midnight. This win extends Sinner's impressive streak to 26 consecutive matches at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments, as he prepares to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the upcoming semi-final.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public holds more nuanced and flexible views on US rivalry and international alliances than often perceived by Americans. The article highlights that nearly half of respondents envision China playing a shared leadership role globally, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. Despite optimism about their nation's future, economy, and military, Chinese citizens remain somewhat skeptical of US intentions. The survey results suggest potential avenues for reducing US-China tensions through a better understanding of these complex perspectives.</p>
