        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift away from the traditional amateur model. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, permits schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and compensates former players barred from revenue sharing. This agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program funding, and the overall landscape of the NCAA. The ruling follows years of legal challenges to the NCAA's amateurism rules.</p>

          <p>The phone call between the leaders of China and the US could offer a respite for many Asian countries caught in their rivalry, but the detente might also complicate their calculations on how to strike a balance between the two superpowers, according to analysts.

However, the relationship between the two powers had ‚Äúbecome more fragile than ever‚Äù, noting that it was the first phone call with Xi since Trump‚Äôs inauguration in January.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning an overhaul of Japan's rice policy in response to soaring rice prices, which have doubled from the previous year. Ishiba aims to reform the decades-old production adjustment system, seeking to boost rice production and counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. The proposed changes face challenges, including the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Ishiba's consumer-focused approach includes releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but some critics caution against using rice policy as a political tool.</p>
