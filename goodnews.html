          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative bloc, has been sworn in as the new Chancellor of Germany, succeeding Olaf Scholz whose government fell apart after a finance minister dispute. Merz is expected to promptly convene his cabinet, which includes both familiar and new faces like Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. Merz is known to have a more hawkish foreign policy stance regarding Russia, and this change of power could change Germany's foreign policy stance regarding the Russo-Ukranian war. The new government is expected to focus on addressing economic challenges and strengthening Germany's role in Europe.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Arsenal's crucial Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain, goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's form is under scrutiny. Questions arise whether Arsenal will face the confident and capable shot-stopper from the first leg or the error-prone version seen earlier in the season. Donnarumma's performances have been inconsistent, with recent mistakes in Ligue 1 raising doubts about his reliability, however, his form has improved alongside the rest of the PSG team during their Champions League campaign. His ability to perform well could determine Arsenal's Champions League fate.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, Germany is still painstakingly searching for its fallen soldiers, with a recent internment of 107 Wehrmacht soldiers near Berlin. The German War Graves Commission (Volksbund) continues to find, exhume, and rebury remains across Europe, offering a dignified burial regardless of their role in the war. Despite some controversy, the effort is seen as a way to close a chapter of history, identifying the dead and ensuring they are not left nameless in the earth.

          <p>China‚Äôs largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, saw a surprise increase in deals signed during its spring edition, driven by record overseas attendance, despite the absence of many American buyers and the threat of US tariffs. The fair's performance has boosted confidence in China's export sector and its ability to withstand a prolonged trade war with the US. The number of visiting overseas buyers reached a record high of 288,938, up 17.3 per cent year-on-year, with most visitors coming from countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
