          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's exploitation of antisemitism charges to justify repressive policies on college campuses. They are organizing protests, writing letters, and lobbying legislators to denounce what they see as the exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel. These Jewish-led efforts aim to defend pro-Palestinian students detained by the administration and challenge the conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Many Jewish Americans are invoking their Jewishness in a public way for the first time to stand against what they view as authoritarianism and defend the liberal principles that have enabled Jewish thriving in the United States.</p>

          <p>Brad Smith, an ALS patient, can now communicate using only his thoughts thanks to a Neuralink brain implant and AI technology. The implant, containing 1024 electrodes, captures neuron firings and transmits them wirelessly to a MacBook Pro, which decodes the signals to move a cursor on the screen. Smith uses Grok, an AI chatbot, to generate responses and suggestions, allowing him to participate in conversations and even play games with his children. This technology is still in its early stages, but it offers hope for people with severe speech impairments caused by ALS, stroke, spinal cord injury, and other neurological conditions.</p>

          <p>Jessica Slice, a disabled mother, shares her experiences and insights on parenting in her new book, emphasizing the importance of accepting a loss of control and asking for help. Diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), Slice argues that her disability has allowed her to embrace dependence on others and reject cultural ideas of perfectionism related to capitalism. She advocates for mutual aid, accessible infrastructure, and stronger social safety nets in parenting, encouraging parents to release control and find joy in the imperfect. Slice also addresses the stigma surrounding disability in reproductive healthcare and calls for justice and equity for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2 billion upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved constructing numerous bridges, junctions, and environmental mitigation measures. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's economic benefits, critics have decried the extensive delays and high cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that the UN's global population estimates may be significantly undercounted, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions of people. This discrepancy is attributed to incomplete or unreliable census data in rural areas of the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, the author argues that anxieties about population growth often reflect power struggles and unequal distribution of resources. The focus should be on responsible consumption, sustainable technologies, and addressing inequalities rather than solely on population control.</p>

The inclusion of caregivers distinguishes memory cafes from other programs, addressing the social isolation and stress that both patients and caregivers often experience after a dementia diagnosis.

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice, priced at 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The move aims to provide relief to households struggling with rising food costs. The agriculture ministry hopes that this direct sale approach will be more effective in curbing rice prices than previous auction attempts.</p>
