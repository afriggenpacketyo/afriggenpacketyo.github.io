          <p>President Trump's threats to annex Canada as the 51st state significantly impacted the Canadian election.  Analysts suggest Trump's actions inadvertently boosted the Liberal Party's Mark Carney, who projected an image of stability amidst the uncertainty.  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's campaign strategy, focused on domestic issues, failed to counter Trump's influence effectively.  Carney's Liberals won a minority government.</p>

The decline of manufacturing jobs and the rise of the cognitive economy have disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and more regressive views.
