          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing a rebound in customer traffic just as the summer season begins, with UBS noting increased foot traffic and sales, causing the stock to rise. Despite ongoing low consumer confidence in the economy, diners are still visiting Texas Roadhouse, leading UBS analysts to predict sustainable outperformance. UBS raised its price target for the stock to $220 per share, citing a 5% increase in second-quarter same-store sales. This positive trend follows a challenging first quarter impacted by weather and inflation, with the company still on track to open 30 new restaurants this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece argues that the growing divide between Donald Trump and Elon Musk represents a fundamental ideological split between nationalism and globalism. The article asserts that while Musk has been admired by some on the right for his defiance of woke ideology, his priorities lie outside of American interests, focusing on technological advancement and space exploration. It posits that Trump remains focused on restoring America's sovereignty and prioritizing the American worker, contrasting this with Musk's vision of a borderless, technologically optimized future. The author urges the MAGA faithful to choose between Trump's terrestrial project and Musk's extraterrestrial ambitions.</p>

          <h2>Locking in Home Equity Loan Rates in June 2025: A Timely Decision?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 13:42:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News analyzes whether homeowners should lock in home equity loan rates in June 2025, citing three key reasons. Firstly, home equity loan rates are stagnating after a period of decline, indicating uncertainty among lenders. Secondly, rates may remain elevated for longer than initially anticipated due to the Federal Reserve's paused interest-rate cut campaign. Lastly, home equity loans are still cheaper than alternatives like personal loans and credit cards, especially considering the fixed-rate benefit in a potentially rising-rate environment. The article suggests that locking in a rate now could be a prudent move for homeowners seeking financing. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to implement a full percentage point interest rate cut, despite a strong jobs report. Trump has consistently pressured Powell to lower rates, and made this latest demand via a Truth Social post, advocating for "Rocket Fuel" for the economy. Market forecasts indicate a low probability of any rate cut, let alone a full point, at the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting. The last time the central bank made a single rate cut of a full percentage point was in March 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

The station connects to the K Line and C Line, with plans to connect to the airport's automated people mover train next year, and currently free shuttle buses provide transport between the center and LAX. The $900 million project includes a bus plaza, bicycle hub, and short-term parking, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion around the airport. While most major cities have direct airport rail connections, LAX has lacked this until now, causing confusion for travelers.

          <p>The International Pride Orchestra performed at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland as a rebuke to Donald Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center and subsequent snub of the LGBTQ+ ensemble. The event featured classical music, choral performances, and drag performances, celebrating WorldPride, which is taking place in Washington D.C. The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center, but Trump's administration has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights and rescinding anti-discrimination policies for LGBTQ+ people. The event served as a reminder that people don't feel safe to live and love openly.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is taking place in Washington, D.C., this year, causing mixed emotions within the LGBTQ+ community due to the Trump administration's policies. While some express fear and concern about safety, others are determined to attend and take a stand. The Trump administration has rolled back several protections for LGBTQ+ people, leading to the cancellation or relocation of Pride events at the Kennedy Center. Despite these challenges, organizers have implemented safety protocols and are finding alternative paths for the celebration. Many are prioritizing their emotional and physical safety, while others are finding ways to show up for the community outside of D.C.</p>
