          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced his concerns about potentially being locked out of China's artificial intelligence market, estimating its value at $50 billion within the next few years. He emphasized that selling to China would generate revenue, taxes, and jobs in the United States, while also stating that Nvidia would support whatever policies are in the best interest of the country. Huang acknowledged Huawei as a formidable technology company and stressed the importance of American AI leading the way globally. Nvidia is set to report earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting revenue growth of 65% from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Despite Warren Buffett's announcement that he intends to leave his CEO role at the end of the year, retail investors poured over $24 million into Berkshire Hathaway's Class B stock on Monday, demonstrating confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel. The surge in net inflows marked the stock's highest since 2016, indicating everyday traders are not uneasy with the company's longtime leader stepping away. Buffett reassured shareholders that he plans to remain involved and praised Abel's management capabilities. Investors are looking to see what's next for Berkshire under Abel, as the company has run circles around the S&P 500 under Buffett.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump digressed to criticize the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, calling it "a disaster" and blaming "woke" construction workers and DEI initiatives for the project's alleged problems. Trump claimed the center is millions of dollars over budget and that Pres. Obama "wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love." A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation refuted Trump's claims, stating they were not based in fact and referenced a dispute between subcontractors. The foundation maintains the center is on track to open in 2026 and will be an economic engine for Chicago.</p>

          <p>NBC Sports will utilize an AI-generated voice of the late Jim Fagan, an iconic narrator from the 1990s, for its upcoming NBA coverage, which begins with the 2025-26 season. Fagan's family granted NBC Sports permission to use AI voice synthesis technology to recreate his voice for select promotional elements, including title sequences and show opens. NBC Sports President Rick Cordella stated that Fagan's voice evokes nostalgia for a special time in NBA history and perfectly captured the magnitude of heavyweight matchups and stars. The AI-generated voice aims to introduce Fagan's legacy to a new generation of fans, with other voiceover artists handling more traditional work.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors don't have to accept a lump-sum settlement offer. However, having your offer rejected doesn't necessarily mean you're out of options, either. If a debt collector refuses your settlement offer, you may still be able to find a path forward. In general, debt collectors will typically refuse settlement offers for a few main reasons: The offer is too low, the debt is still fresh, or they believe you can pay more. Working with a debt relief expert can improve your chances of settling your debt.</p>
