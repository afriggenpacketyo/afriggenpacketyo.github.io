          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is projected to remain over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next several days, posing no direct threat to land. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm, located east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, is expected to begin weakening Monday night. Forecasters anticipate Fernand could become a post-tropical cyclone by Wednesday before dissipating on Thursday. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store has issued a statement in response to widespread criticism regarding its recent rebranding and new logo. The company acknowledged that it "could've done a better job sharing who we are" and reassured customers that its core values remain unchanged. The new logo, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character and "old country store" phrase, had been described by social media users as "generic" and "soulless," leading to a 7% drop in company shares. Cracker Barrel clarified that Uncle Herschel will still feature on menus and in stores.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, discussing trade and North Korea. Trump lauded his "great relationship" with Kim Jong-un and expressed openness to future meetings, while Lee praised Trump's peacemaking efforts and suggested a "Trump Tower" in North Korea. The meeting followed a recent trade deal capping tariffs on South Korean exports to the U.S. at 15%. However, Trump had earlier posted critical comments on social media about alleged "raids on churches" in South Korea, though he softened his tone during the meeting.</p>

          <h2>Notting Hill Carnival Reports Significant Reduction in Serious Violence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 16:47:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced a substantial decrease in serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to previous years. As of Monday evening, 423 arrests were made over two days, with only two stabbings reported, neither resulting in serious injury. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this improvement to proactive measures, including the use of live facial recognition technology, metal detectors, and stop-and-search operations. Civil liberty groups, however, raised concerns about the reintroduction of facial recognition, calling it a mass surveillance tool.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back electric vehicle (EV) incentives, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for an affordable four-door pickup truck, priced around $30,000. This strategic move, aiming for 2027 deliveries, targets a mass market segment often overlooked by pricier EVs. While EV sales in the U.S. have slowed, global markets are rapidly adopting electric vehicles, driven by government subsidies and environmental regulations. Ford's bet on a cheaper model indicates a long-term commitment to electrification, recognizing that price is a key driver for widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated feature "KPop Demon Hunters" saw significant box office success with a two-day theatrical release of its sing-along version, estimated to have generated $16 million to $20 million domestically. While Netflix typically uses theatrical releases for marketing its streaming service rather than for broad cinema runs, this event demonstrates the power of "eventizing" films. The movie has already become Netflix's second-most-watched English language film, and experts believe the theatrical buzz will further boost its streaming viewership. Despite this success, analysts predict it's a one-off and unlikely to alter Netflix's core streaming strategy.</p>

The judge expressed concerns about the government's intention to deport him to a country where he has no ties and questioned the conditioning of constitutional rights on a plea agreement.
