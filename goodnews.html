        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed that he once spent $5,000 on special milk ordered by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady to maintain a positive relationship between the two players during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. The milk, intended to support Brady's nutrition-oriented diet, was delayed and spoiled, prompting Belichick to approve the unusual expense to avoid straining the player dynamic. Although Brown's time with the Patriots was short-lived, he and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
