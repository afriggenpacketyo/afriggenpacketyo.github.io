          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed the majority of claims against celebrities and YouTubers, including Tom Brady and Steph Curry, who endorsed the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The lawsuit alleged that these stars violated advertising laws by not disclosing their financial incentives. Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct. This ruling narrows the scope of the multidistrict litigation, which accuses them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform, following FTX's collapse in November 2022.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will donate virtually all of his wealth, totaling $200 billion, to the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's belief that dying rich is a disgrace. This decision will result in his net worth dropping by 99% as the Gates Foundation aims to close in 2045, earlier than initially planned. The foundation will focus on preventing deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and promoting prosperity through education. Gates expressed concern that cuts to foreign aid by the U.S. and European countries could hinder progress, potentially leading to an increase in childhood deaths.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the U.S. may announce new trade agreements, as his administration faces pressure to strike deals before a 90-day pause on tariffs ends on July 9.

Negotiations are ongoing with countries including Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

The article also highlights that the trade uncertainty is weighing on the Bank of England, which cut interest rates amid concerns about lingering price pressures and the impact of trade uncertainty on business investment and consumer spending.</p>
