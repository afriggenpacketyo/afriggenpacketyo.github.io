          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation. This annual adjustment, known as preventing "bracket creep," means Americans will need to earn more before moving into a higher tax bracket. For example, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly will increase to $32,200. The article explains how the U.S. progressive tax system works and notes that these changes could result in an average tax cut for the typical filer. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reiterated his support for lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious and gradual approach due to conflicting economic data. In a recent interview, Waller noted that while the labor market shows signs of weakening, GDP growth remains strong and inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. He expressed comfort with the Federal Open Market Committee's current pace of two more quarter-point cuts by year-end, pushing back against calls for more aggressive reductions. Waller stated that moving too quickly could be a significant policy mistake. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing the preservation of wealth over its growth. He argues that individuals in their 20s and 30s should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds, as they have a long time horizon to recover from market volatility. Historically, stocks have outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth and combating inflation. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds to achieve diversified stock market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Costco Emerges as a Major Player in the Apparel Industry</h2>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown into a multi-billion dollar clothing retailer, with its annual apparel sales increasing nearly 40% from $7 billion in 2019 to $9.7 billion in 2024. This sales volume surpasses that of established apparel retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and Old Navy. The company's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its private Kirkland Signature label. A key part of Costco's strategy involves opportunistic purchases and licensing deals, creating a "treasure hunt" shopping experience for customers who are never sure what brands they might find in stores.</p>

          <p>A significant rise in the price of Bitcoin over the past year has created approximately 70,000 new crypto millionaires, bringing the global total to over 241,000. According to a new study, these investors spend about 9.7 cents for every dollar of added crypto wealth, a rate more than double that of stock market gains, contributing an estimated $145 billion in additional consumer spending in 2024. While some high-profile spending is on luxury items, most consumption is directed towards restaurants, entertainment, and real estate. Many long-term crypto holders are reportedly not cashing out, expecting further price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire has officially taken effect in Gaza, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) beginning to reposition troops along newly established deployment lines. This move initiates the first phase of an agreement that includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the operation, the U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with around 200 U.S. servicemembers to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid. The agreement also stipulates that more humanitarian assistance will be allowed into the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>The NBA is holding its first preseason games in Macao, China, in six years, marking a significant step in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market. The league's presence in China was severely diminished following a 2019 controversy, but it is now looking to tap into the country's massive fanbase to drive future growth as U.S. television viewership declines. The NBA has renewed a partnership with Alibaba and continues to invest in retail and community infrastructure in the country. This return is seen as a crucial milestone for re-establishing the NBA's foothold and commercial success in the region.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared that his party is prepared to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party in the next Senedd election. At the party's annual conference, he will promise a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," arguing that political change in Wales is inevitable. Labour has dominated Welsh politics for a century, but recent polling suggests a closer contest with both Plaid Cymru and Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth is positioning his party as the primary choice for voters who want to prevent a Reform UK victory and bring about a different future for Wales.</p>

          <h2>Columbia University's Knight Institute Wins Free Speech Case Against Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 07:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian students. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of student Mahmoud Khalil was unconstitutional and designed to chill free speech. This win highlights a contrast between the institute's defiant stance and Columbia University's more submissive approach, which recently involved a settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims. The case has positioned the institute at the forefront of legal challenges to the administration's actions regarding free speech on college campuses.</p>
