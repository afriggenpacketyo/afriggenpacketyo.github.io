          <p>Famed New York City restaurateur Keith McNally opens up about his life in a new memoir, "I Regret Almost Everything." He discusses the profound impact of a 2016 stroke on his mobility and speech, which led to a period of deep embarrassment and a subsequent suicide attempt. McNally also reflects on his use of social media as a communication tool post-stroke, including his controversial public call-out of James Corden, which he now views with some regret. The article details his journey from a working-class London background to becoming a major figure in the New York culinary scene, emphasizing the importance of kindness from his staff.</p>

          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay with On-Court Message During All-Star Game</h2>

          <p>WNBA stars used the All-Star Game as a platform to call for increased salaries amid contentious collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations with the league. Players, including the sidelined Caitlin Clark, wore warm-up shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight their demands. The players argue that the league's booming business, including a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, justifies a significant pay increase. Despite the public pressure, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a "transformational" new agreement will be reached before the current CBA expires on October 31.</p>

          <h2>New Research Explores the Science of Intentional Personality Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:13:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent developments in psychology suggest that personality traits, once thought to be fixed, can be intentionally redesigned. The article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who, dissatisfied with her anxious and introverted nature, embarked on a year-long journey to change her personality by actively stepping outside her comfort zone through activities like improv comedy. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala's research supports this, indicating that consciously altering one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors over time can lead to fundamental shifts in personality. This approach, detailed in Khazan's book "Me, But Better," offers a new perspective on mental health and personal development beyond traditional therapy.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events and media company Create & Cultivate, identifies a major red flag in job interviews as candidates who arrive unprepared and lack knowledge about the company. She values applicants who have done their due diligence and can offer thoughtful feedback on the business's current operations, such as its marketing strategies. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by candidates who can openly discuss mistakes or challenges they've faced and explain how they solved problems under pressure. For a startup environment, she believes adaptability and the ability to reflect on both successes and failures are crucial traits for new hires.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, discusses her trailblazing career and the current political landscape. She recounts facing both racism, like a fellow senator singing "Dixie" to taunt her, and sexism, which she argues is a more difficult barrier to overcome in American society. Moseley Braun reflects on her 1993-1999 term, her subsequent presidential run, and the progress made since. She expresses concern that the Democratic party is struggling to effectively counter Donald Trump and warns that many gains from the civil rights movement are being reversed under his administration, though she remains optimistic about democracy's resilience.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article explains that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them that their feelings are invalid, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. To foster this crucial skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves without judgment, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence for a successful life.</p>

          <p>A 300-year-old maritime mystery may be closer to being solved, as archaeologists believe they have found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the infamous pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as La Buse, in 1721. The ship was laden with a vast treasure of gold, silver, and jewels, estimated to be worth over $100 million today. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the bulk of La Buse's legendary treasure, which he cryptically alluded to before his execution, remains undiscovered.</p>

          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. A Georgia judge determined the private foundation was subject to the state's Open Records Act, setting a potential precedent for police foundations nationwide, which are often used to fund police activities without public scrutiny. The released documents reveal the APF's active lobbying efforts to prevent a public referendum on the project. Activists and plaintiffs in the case see the ruling as a crucial step toward transparency, preventing such foundations from operating as a "black box."</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for treating diabetes and obesity, could be a breakthrough for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Many women with PCOS, which can cause irregular periods, infertility, and weight gain, have reported significant symptom improvement after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss, which in turn helps regulate hormones like testosterone. While larger clinical trials are needed and insurance coverage remains a barrier, the initial results offer hope for a condition that has seen few new treatments in decades.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck in the Pacific Ocean near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sunday. The quakes prompted initial tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger had passed, and Russia's Emergencies Ministry also lifted its warning. The largest tremor occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 20 kilometers, about 144 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Amid conservative backlash to the idea of Superman as an immigrant, this article explores the character's leftist origins with Grant Morrison, author of the influential "All-Star Superman" comic series. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and landlords, acting as a socialist figure. Morrison explains how the character evolved over the decades, becoming a patriotic symbol during WWII, a suburban family man in the 1950s, and a cosmic seeker in the 1960s. This history reveals a character far more radical than modern interpretations often suggest, making him a timeless and adaptable metaphor.</p>
