        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, returns on savings accounts like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are declining. However, savers can still find rates around 4.50% by employing specific strategies. The article suggests considering online-only banks, which typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs. It also recommends using online marketplace sites for easy comparison and focusing on short-term CDs, as they currently provide more competitive rates than their long-term counterparts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, slightly up from June. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests President Trump's tariffs are influencing the economy, though it aligned with economists' expectations. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September, a sentiment supported by Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Consumer spending also increased, indicating economic resilience despite higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade, 23, has completed a high-profile transfer to Newcastle United in the Premier League for a reported record fee of €85 million. Known for his unique combination of size and technical skill, Woltemade gained prominence last season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals and helping the club win the German Cup. Despite interest from Bayern Munich, Stuttgart held out for a higher offer from the Premier League club. The move is seen as a significant step for Woltemade's career, potentially securing his place in Germany's World Cup squad.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported stronger-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, causing its stock to rise in premarket trading. The positive results were largely fueled by a 26% year-on-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, which benefited from robust demand for AI-related products. The company's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival, though profits in that division fell due to heavy investment in the competitive "instant commerce" sector. Despite missing overall revenue forecasts, investors reacted positively to the significant growth in the high-potential cloud and AI segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by Chris DeVille, "Such Great Heights," examines the evolution of the indie rock genre, which flourished in the 2000s with bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse. The article reviews the book, reflecting on how the internet and music blogs like Pitchfork propelled a niche, anti-mainstream aesthetic into a significant cultural and commercial force that shaped Millennial identity. It discusses how the scene's values of authenticity and sonic exploration eventually influenced mainstream pop music through producers like Jack Antonoff. The review also considers how streaming services later altered the landscape for this style of music.</p>

          <h2>Indian Economy Surpasses Expectations with 7.8% GDP Growth in June Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 08:33:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%. The strong growth was driven by robust performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some analysts point to a slowdown in nominal GDP growth, which does not account for inflation, as a potential sign of weakening momentum. The positive figures come as the country braces for the impact of new 50% U.S. tariffs, which are expected to soften growth in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article from Vox's Future Perfect section addresses several reader questions on complex topics. It advises on how to verify information from AI, suggesting its best use is for finding verifiable facts rather than subjective ethical guidance. Another response discusses the media's general blind spot and deference to the meat industry when covering animal agriculture, attributing it to ingrained cultural biases. A final section explains the global complexities of kidney donation, noting that strict rules against compensation, designed to prevent trafficking, also create barriers for altruistic donors and limit the supply of available organs.</p>

          <p>The potential British record transfer of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool is reportedly the key to unlocking a chain of other deals before the transfer deadline. Liverpool is expected to submit an improved offer of at least £120 million for Isak, who has publicly stated his desire to leave. For the deal to proceed, Newcastle is looking to sign two replacements: Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, a deal which is close to completion, and Yoane Wissa from Brentford. Brentford's willingness to sell Wissa is in turn dependent on them securing a replacement, creating a complex, interdependent series of negotiations.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has indicated his support for a quarter-point interest rate cut in September, and suggested he could be open to a larger half-point cut if upcoming labor market data shows further weakening. In a recent speech, Waller expressed concern that economic conditions could deteriorate rapidly and argued the Fed should act preemptively. He anticipates that forthcoming revisions to jobs data will show the economy created far fewer jobs than initially reported. Waller, considered a potential candidate for Fed Chair, dissented from the July decision to hold rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a woman recounts meeting her future husband at a Hollywood bar shortly after moving to Los Angeles. Initially unimpressed by the man, a self-described "free-spirited backpacker" from Michigan who was sleeping on a friend's couch, she was quickly charmed when he pronounced her Venezuelan name correctly and spoke fluent Spanish. Their connection grew over shared stories and a challenge to a dance-off. A first date on the dance floor, complete with a perfectly timed kiss, sealed the deal, leading to a nine-year relationship and global travels together.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has left Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his latest squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. The 26-year-old right-back has recently struggled for a starting position at his new club. In his place, the squad features first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Tottenham full-back Djed Spence, who are rewarded for their strong club form. The 24-man squad also sees recalls for Marcus Rashford and Adam Wharton, but there is no place for Kyle Walker or Phil Foden.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old woman in Cologne, Germany, has ignited a national movement after she confronted and filmed a man who was secretly recording her from behind while she was jogging. After learning that filming clothed body parts for sexual purposes is not a criminal offense under current German law, she started a petition demanding a change. The petition has garnered over 125,000 signatures, and her video of the confrontation has gone viral, sparking a widespread conversation about sexual harassment. The issue is now expected to be discussed by German justice ministers at an upcoming conference.</p>
