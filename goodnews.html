          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, a 17-year investment that concluded earlier this year. BYD publicly acknowledged the sale, expressing gratitude to Buffett and Charlie Munger for their long-standing belief and support in the company, while emphasizing that buying and selling stocks is a normal part of investment. Despite a recent 6% drop in BYD shares in Hong Kong and a cut to its 2025 sales target, the company highlighted that Buffett realized a profit of 20 times his initial capital. Concurrently, Berkshire Hathaway is expanding its portfolio, having increased its holdings in several Japanese "trading house" stocks, with stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%.

Many of the museum's most iconic artifacts are designated top national treasures, preventing their physical travel outside China. To overcome this, the institution is actively promoting digital exhibitions, high-quality replicas, and photo displays for museums worldwide, pending state approval.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article proposes that a potential return of Donald Trump to power could signal a significant shift, leading to the end of ideology in US-China relations. It suggests a "reverse convergence" where the US might adopt a more pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace, mirroring China's stance, rather than the long-held Western fantasy of China converging with liberal democratic values. The author critiques traditional convergence theory for oversimplifying social change and underestimating power dynamics. This perspective implies a departure from previous diplomatic frameworks, potentially reshaping global interactions between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has successfully grown its first rice crop, an ambitious experiment led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aided by the hottest summer on record. This trial explores future food sources and innovative climate change mitigation strategies, particularly the potential for cultivating rice on peat soils in Cambridgeshire. Flooding these soils could effectively lock away greenhouse gases, offering a solution to emissions from drying peatlands. While currently a risky commercial crop, researchers believe rice could become a widely viable crop in the UK within the next decade if average temperatures continue to rise.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been honored with an Ig Nobel Prize for their quirky yet inventive study into how foul-smelling shoes impact the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, initiated by observations in university hostels, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the primary culprit behind shoe odor and sought practical solutions. They developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack designed to sterilize footwear in just 2-3 minutes, effectively eliminating the smell without damaging the material. This delightfully oddball scientific endeavor aims to improve daily life by tackling a universal domestic problem with an innovative design.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless claims of 2020 election rigging. Giuliani, who led former President Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the election results, faced significant legal and financial setbacks due to his role in spreading conspiracy theories. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion secured with Fox News and Newsmax. The outcome underscores the legal consequences for individuals and entities that propagate false information, which undermined public confidence in US elections and led to threats against election officials.</p>

          <p>Europe secured an impressive 11½-4½ lead over the USA heading into the Ryder Cup singles matches, needing only 2.5 more points for retention. The day at Bethpage Black was marred by "thuggish" and "moronic" behavior from American fans, particularly targeting Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry with personal insults and disruptions, leading to security interventions. Despite the crowd issues and a minor on-course spat involving Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau, Europe maintained its composure and delivered a dominant performance, winning both Saturday sessions 3-1. A late injury concern for Viktor Hovland could potentially reduce the singles matches to 11.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's forthcoming book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the pivotal swing justice. Kennedy asserts, "The cases swung, not me," as the court grew more conservative, and expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions. He reveals how his views evolved on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the plight of children with gay parents, and abortion, where he balanced moral opposition with constitutional liberty. The article also details his reconciliation with Justice Scalia and his rejection of strict originalism.</p>

          <h2>Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging: Efficacy Debated by Dermatologists</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic among consumers and clinicians. While some users report benefits like brighter skin, thicker hair, and stronger nails, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen's ability to effectively reach and impact skin cells. Conflicting research findings exist, with industry-funded studies suggesting positive effects, while independent studies often show no significant impact. Experts generally recommend marine collagen over vegan options but emphasize that sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more effective strategies for maintaining overall skin health.</p>
