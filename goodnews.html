          <p>U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine visited Puerto Rico, signaling a significant escalation in the American campaign against Caribbean drug cartels. Welcomed by local officials, the visit underscores the Trump administration's commitment to using the island as a strategic base for enhanced naval and air operations aimed at disrupting trafficking routes from Latin America. This intensified effort, which includes the deployment of multiple warships, follows a recent shift in military engagement from seizure to lethal strikes against designated narco-terrorist groups. The move is part of a broader "America First" security policy focused on confronting the Maduro regime in Venezuela and dismantling criminal networks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 16:07:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate recently experiencing a significant drop, prospective homebuyers have an opportunity to secure better loan terms, though rates remain well above pandemic-era lows. Financial experts advise that borrowers can actively influence the rates they are offered by taking specific preparatory steps. Key strategies include improving one's FICO credit score by paying bills on time and reducing revolving debt, which can substantially lower the interest paid over the life of a loan. Additionally, providing a larger down payment of 20% or more can lead to better rates and helps avoid private mortgage insurance, while also considering alternatives like adjustable-rate mortgages for lower initial payments.

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This inclusion, which replaces Caesars Entertainment, is a major milestone for the company and can trigger substantial stock purchases from passive index funds that track the benchmark. The move ended months of speculation on Wall Street and marks a victory for the firm, whose stock has risen more than 210% year-to-date despite volatility since its 2021 public offering. The news underscores Robinhood's substantial growth and market capitalization, solidifying its position as a major player in the financial industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where enrollment can be delayed or financial assistance can be obtained. The most common method is to remain covered by a creditable employer health plan after age 65, which allows for penalty-free postponement of Part B enrollment until retirement. For individuals with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs and Medicaid can help cover or eliminate these premiums entirely. However, forgoing Part B coverage can restrict access to supplemental insurance like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services not covered by Medicare.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the 3-on-3 women's basketball league Unrivaled, which is now valued at $340 million. The investment was part of a Series B funding round that also included participation from soccer star Alex Morgan and other prominent sports figures. Unrivaled was established to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option for offseason competition, claiming to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports league history. This move reflects Williams' continued focus on championing early-stage companies and supporting the growth and financial viability of women's sports, a key mission for her since retiring from professional tennis.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $40,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account requires careful consideration of the current economic climate. While both currently offer attractive rates in the 4% range, a CD provides a fixed rate that locks in earnings for its entire term, protecting against future rate declines. In contrast, a high-yield savings account offers liquidity and easy access to funds but has a variable rate that will fall when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Savers must weigh the long-term earning potential of a CD against the flexibility of a savings account, ensuring they can commit to leaving funds untouched to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's minority Labour Party government is on track to win a narrow victory. The ruling center-left coalition is expected to secure a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing it to remain in power. The election campaign focused primarily on domestic issues such as inflation, wealth taxes, and the quality of public services. However, international instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies, also played a role, with some observers suggesting that global uncertainty may have led voters to favor the stability offered by the incumbent government.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has announced his intention to incorporate the long throw-in as a key offensive strategy for the upcoming World Cup. This tactical approach, famously utilized by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in English football as a way to create scoring opportunities directly from the sideline. Data shows a notable increase in the use and effectiveness of long throws into the opponent's penalty area in the Premier League. With limited preparation time before the tournament, Tuchel and his staff believe that focusing on set-piece tactics like throw-ins could provide a crucial competitive advantage for the national team.</p>

The front is also forecast to bring light rain and thunderstorms to Northern California and the Bay Area, which could help dampen the risk of wildfires in the region. While Southern California is not expected to receive significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may produce some coastal drizzle, though not enough to end the high fire season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage interest rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased their homes during recent periods of high rates may be considering refinancing. Before proceeding, it is crucial to assess whether current rates are low enough to justify the action, with a common guideline being a reduction of at least one full percentage point. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for rates to rise unexpectedly. Factoring in closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and evaluating long-term plans for the home are essential steps to ensure that refinancing is a financially sound decision.
