          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk an interim award of company shares valued at approximately $29 billion, aimed at incentivizing him to remain with the company for at least two more years. This "good faith" payment is intended to honor a 2018 compensation package worth over $50 billion that was previously voided by a Delaware court. The new award is conditional and will be forfeited if the original 2018 package is reinstated upon appeal. The move comes as Tesla faces declining sales and increased competition.</p>

          <p>Following a weak July jobs report, market analysts are increasingly anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September to stimulate the slowing economy. Such a move is expected to be bullish for the stock market. Concurrently, major technology companies are projected to significantly increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with spending expected to grow 56% in 2025. This sustained investment in data centers and cloud computing signals strong confidence in the long-term profitability of AI, benefiting not just tech giants but also industrial and energy companies.

In a social media post, Trump called the campaign the "hottest ad out there" and complimented Sweeney, who is reportedly a registered Republican. The ad campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism. The president's endorsement caused the company's stock to rebound sharply, highlighting the significant impact of political commentary on consumer brands and market performance.</p>

          <p>Researchers have finally identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study reveals the culprit is not a virus, as previously suspected, but a bacteria called Vibrio pectenicida, which has also been found in shellfish. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing about 90% of its population. This discovery provides a crucial breakthrough, potentially allowing scientists to develop strategies to help the critically endangered sea star populations recover.</p>

          <p>A massive construction boom for AI data centers is underway across the United States, driven by huge infrastructure spending from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. A comprehensive analysis shows that Northern Virginia and Maricopa County, Arizona, are the primary hot spots, with 329 and 48 data centers respectively. While these projects bring economic activity, they also raise concerns due to their immense consumption of power and water, and the significant tax breaks offered to developers. The total number of data centers in the U.S. has nearly quadrupled since 2010.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay the implementation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods for six months, pushing the effective date to at least March. This pause provides time for both sides to finalize and implement a trade agreement reached in late July between President Trump and the European Commission president. The deal, which includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, is seen as a step toward restoring stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is still seeking exemptions for certain goods, like car parts and wine.</p>
