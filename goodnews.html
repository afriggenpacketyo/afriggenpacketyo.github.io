        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bumble shares surged after the dating app company announced it will lay off 30% of its workforce, which equates to approximately 240 roles, as part of a strategic restructuring. The layoffs are expected to incur charges of $13 million to $18 million during the third and fourth quarters of the year, but the company anticipates annual cost savings of $40 million. Bumble plans to reinvest these savings into product and technology development to strengthen its core business and position itself for future growth. Shares of the dating app company have struggled since going public in 2021, with its market value declining significantly. The company hopes that the restructuring will help to revive growth and improve its financial performance. The optimism score for the dating app company's future after the restructuring is cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, amidst a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Speaking at a news conference during the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, Trump stated that a formal agreement with Iran may not be necessary, citing the destruction of their nuclear sites. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The announcement follows meetings with world leaders and cautious optimism regarding the ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration, which ended a 12-day conflict that resulted in casualties in both Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, descendant communities and their allies are engaged in ongoing battles to preserve Black burial sites, which are often threatened by development and neglect. These sites, such as the Moses Macedonia African Cemetery in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Evergreen Cemetery in St. Petersburg, Florida, face challenges ranging from encroaching construction to lack of oversight. Activists are working to document the existence of these cemeteries, protest development, and conduct genealogical research to protect the remains of enslaved people and their descendants. While a federal law exists to protect Black cemeteries, it has not yet been funded by Congress, highlighting the need for continued advocacy and community-based preservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, designed to provide safe passage for wildlife over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is entering its second and final phase. This phase involves installing connectors to facilitate wildlife movement between the Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains. The work is complex, requiring the burying of overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and constructing a tunnel over Agoura Road, all while preserving a grove of native oak trees. Partial closures of Agoura Road are expected to begin in early August and last for several months, with the project's completion anticipated by the end of 2026. This is a large scale effort to reconnect wildlife habitats that have been fragmented by human infrastructure.</p>

Trump also characterized it as a major win for Europe and Western civilization, highlighting the importance of collective defense efforts among NATO allies.

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, revealing that it has achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and plans to reduce costs by another $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock declined in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's long-term cost-cutting initiative, known as the DRIVE program, is aimed at improving profitability and efficiency. The quarterly results come shortly after the death of FedEx founder and executive chairman, Fred Smith.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has declined to place Los Angeles' homelessness programs into receivership, despite finding that the city failed to adhere to the terms of a settlement agreement. The judge cited that receivership is a last resort and that less intrusive remedies should be exhausted first. He did, however, find that the city breached the agreement by failing to provide a plan for creating new homeless beds and by missing quarterly housing targets. The judge ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review the city's data and signaled that he would likely order the city to pay legal fees for the plaintiffs. The ruling signals a need for improved oversight and data management in L.A.'s homelessness programs.</p>
