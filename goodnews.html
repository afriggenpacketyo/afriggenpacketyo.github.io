Intrator assured that financing remains robust and lenders understand the company's contract-backed business model.

          <p>Several Republicans have declined to run for key Senate seats, raising concerns about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates, particularly centrist figures. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp and former Gov. Chris Sununu opted out of Senate races in Georgia and New Hampshire, respectively. Some Republicans believe that Trump's influence and demands for loyalty may deter candidates who want to focus on state-specific issues. However, others argue that these decisions don't indicate broader recruitment problems, citing Trump's previous win in Georgia and enthusiasm among Republicans in New Hampshire.</p>

          <p>Aurora Innovation has launched driverless truck operations in Texas, running SAE Level 4 trucks without safety drivers between Dallas and Houston for commercial customers. These trucks, serving Uber Freight and Hirschbach Motor Lines, have delivered 10,000 customer loads over 3 million miles in supervised testing. This is part of a broader trend of autonomous trucking companies focusing on Texas and the Southwest. The company plans to expand driverless truck services to Phoenix and El Paso later this year.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy Shows Stronger-Than-Expected Growth</h2>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, exceeding expectations and surpassing growth rates in other major economies. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the growth to strong spending on services like retail, hospitality, and finance. However, economists caution that this growth may be temporary due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. A recent UK-US trade deal may alleviate some tariff pressures, but its effects are yet to be seen.</p>
