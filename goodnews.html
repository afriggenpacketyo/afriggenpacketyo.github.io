          <p>Former President Donald Trump has pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The couple was found guilty of conspiring to defraud Atlanta-area community banks for over $36 million in loans and conspiring to defraud the IRS. Todd received a 12-year prison sentence, while Julie was sentenced to seven years. Trump stated he hopes to have them "free and clean" soon, adding that he does not know them personally, but sympathizes with their situation due to what he believes is an unjust justice system.</p>

A study revealed that minor imperfections in the track can cause violent vibrations at speeds of 1,000km/h. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) claim they have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride less unpleasant.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children or pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a significant shift from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Kennedy cited a lack of data supporting the need for shots in healthy children, echoing his skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines. While many agree that the initial course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness, the need for annual vaccines against new variants is more contentious.</p>
