          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. Instead of focusing on memorized phrases, these parents openly discuss emotions, demonstrate empathy in daily life, and foster authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. They also teach conflict resolution, validate feelings, and listen more than they lecture, creating an environment of emotional safety. These practices help children develop crucial life skills like emotional regulation and social awareness, which are foundational for building healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers on Nantucket are developing a novel approach to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population, which are the primary carriers of the bacteria. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project uses CRISPR technology to create mice with a heritable immunity to Lyme, aiming to break the transmission cycle to ticks. This method avoids disrupting the ecosystem by not culling the mouse population, which is a key part of the local food chain. The project is proceeding with extensive community consultation to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered mice into the wild.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has officially launched, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the principles of free inquiry and open debate. Founded by prominent figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university seeks to counter what they describe as a pervasive culture of self-censorship and ideological conformity on other campuses. With an inaugural class of 92 students and tuition currently free, UATX emphasizes intellectual diversity and civil discourse, using the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk as a backdrop for the urgent national conversation on free speech. The institution aims to foster critical thinking without a predetermined political bias.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. Unlike other monarchs that live for about a month, this generation can live up to nine times longer by suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the journey. Scientists are still studying the mystery of how these butterflies navigate to the same location year after year. However, their population has declined by 70% in 30 years due to threats like illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their primary food source, prompting conservation efforts to protect their habitat.</p>

The loss came after the bullpen gave up three runs in the eighth inning. The game marked a franchise milestone, as the team's home attendance surpassed four million for the first time. With their spot in the postseason nearly secured, the team and its fans are focused on the upcoming playoffs, where the Dodgers are expected to return to Dodger Stadium to open their National League title campaign.</p>

          <h2>Common Misconceptions About Hybrid Vehicle Technology Debunked</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 18:05:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite being available for over two decades, several misconceptions about hybrid vehicles persist among consumers. This article clarifies that most hybrids do not need to be plugged in, as they recharge their batteries through regenerative braking, unlike plug-in hybrids or full EVs. It also addresses maintenance costs, noting that while battery replacement can be expensive, it is covered by long warranties, and routine expenses may be lower due to reduced wear on the engine and brakes. Furthermore, the article explains that hybrids improve fuel efficiency on highways as well as in cities and that performance-oriented hybrids, like those from Porsche and McLaren, demonstrate the technology can also be used to enhance power and driving excitement.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were crucial in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a remarkable juggling catch, kicking the ball with his foot to regain control after it was dislodged from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final NL wild-card spot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will stimulate economic growth. The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway into a fully operational second runway, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport claims the expansion will create jobs and boost the local economy, the decision has faced strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups. Critics argue the expansion will increase noise and air pollution and undermine the UK's climate commitments.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school's principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a dumpster he was unlocking. The video shows Marsh recoiling in surprise as the bear's head appears, after which both the principal and the bear quickly retreat in opposite directions. The incident, in which no one was harmed, serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats shrink. Experts emphasize the importance of securing trash and food sources to prevent attracting animals like bears into populated areas.</p>

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City in a crucial Premier League match. After an early goal from Erling Haaland, City manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half, ceding possession in an attempt to protect the lead. The tactic, which saw City record its lowest possession figure in a league game under Guardiola, nearly succeeded. However, Arsenal's late breakthrough ensured a sharing of the points, a result that ultimately benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the table.</p>
