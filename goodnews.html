          <p>After a decade with Tottenham Hotspur, club captain Son Heung-min is leaving the team, with a potential move to Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer. The South Korean forward, who joined in 2015, became a club legend, scoring 173 goals and recently helping Spurs secure their first major trophy in 17 years with a Europa League victory. The article reflects on his significant impact on the club, his immense popularity in South Korea where he is considered a national treasure, and his emotional departure as a celebrated figure in the Premier League.

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has raised questions about Joe Root's performance in Australia, suggesting the English batter needs to adjust his technique for the upcoming Ashes series. Warner pointed out that Root has never scored a century in Australia and is often dismissed by bowler Josh Hazlewood, humorously advising him to "take the surfboard off his front leg." Currently in England to play for London Spirit in The Hundred, Warner also commented on facing veteran English bowler James Anderson, noting the white ball used in the tournament will be different from the red Dukes ball from past Ashes series. Warner's comments add a layer of friendly rivalry before the winter tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new illustrative comic delves into why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments and what this reaction reveals about their self-perception. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao explain the science behind this common social interaction, highlighting how one's response can impact both their own feelings and those of the person giving the praise. The piece makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks, framing it as a beneficial social skill. It serves as a lighthearted yet insightful guide for anyone who instinctively dismisses praise, offering a different perspective on these everyday exchanges.</p>

          <p>The song "Golden" from the animated Netflix film "KPop Demon Hunters" has surged to the top of the UK singles chart, becoming a massive and unexpected success. The movie, about a fictional K-pop girl band leading a double life as demon fighters, is Netflix's most-watched animated film. Ejae, who co-wrote and performed the track, described the success as overwhelming and dream-like. The song's hopeful and powerful message is credited for its widespread appeal, resonating with audiences and potentially becoming the song of the summer. It is the first K-pop single to top the UK chart since PSY's "Gangnam Style" in 2012.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling that found a "mountain of evidence" suggesting federal tactics violated the Constitution by targeting people based on factors like race or language. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups after federal agents conducted widespread roundups in the region. Judges on the panel sharply questioned the government's arguments, stating that in a diverse area like Los Angeles, such broad profiling cannot establish the reasonable suspicion required for a stop.</p>

          <p>Two state-owned Chinese firms are investing US$350 million to develop large-scale agricultural projects in Angola, aiming to bolster China's food security. SinoHydro Group will invest over US$100 million to create a grain base on 30,000 hectares, with 60% of the output designated for China. In a separate deal, the conglomerate Citic has committed US$250 million to cultivate 100,000 hectares for soybean and corn production over the next five years. These significant investments underscore China's strategy of securing overseas food sources and strengthening its agricultural supply chain through international partnerships.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is set to face Spain in a warm-up match that serves as a crucial proving ground for players ahead of the Rugby World Cup. While Spain, ranked 13th, is not expected to pose a major threat, the game offers a vital opportunity for players on the fringe of the squad to impress head coach John Mitchell. The internal competition for positions is intense, with players across the lineup vying for a spot in the final World Cup squad. Captain Marlie Packer emphasized the team's ambition to win the tournament on home soil and inspire the nation, similar to the recent success of England's women footballers.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potato's Origins from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Hybrid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 01:18:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese-led research team has discovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event between a forerunner of the tomato and a tuberless, potato-like plant. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the crop's evolution back approximately nine million years. This pioneering study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary driver for the development of tubers, the starchy part of the potato that has made it a global food staple. The findings shed new light on the genetic history of one of the world's most important crops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has delivered a significant setback to the Trump administration by upholding a block on indiscriminate "roving patrols" by immigration agents in Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot stop individuals based solely on factors like race or location, as this does not meet the 4th Amendment's standard for reasonable suspicion. The court's fiery opinion rejected the government's claim that the injunction would harm enforcement efforts, noting the likelihood of future unconstitutional stops was "considerable." Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for the rule of law that would help ease the fear gripping immigrant communities.</p>
