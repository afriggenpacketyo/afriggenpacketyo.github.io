          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, with hiding a looted 18th-century painting. The artwork, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was discovered hanging in her home through an online real estate listing after being missing for 80 years. The heir of the original Dutch-Jewish owner, Jacques Goudstikke, has filed a legal claim to recover the piece. Authorities seized the painting after raiding Kadgien's properties, where other potentially stolen items were also found.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup last eight with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the wide margin, the team delivered an unsettled and error-prone performance in the first half, struggling against Australia's intensity and effective tactics. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the team was "untidy in attack" but praised their defensive effort, which kept the Wallaroos scoreless after the interval. The performance highlights areas for improvement as they head into knockout play.</p>

NFL executives emphasize their commitment to building a sustained fan base in new markets through media deals and local engagement.

          <p>Director Oliver Laxe's new film, "Sirât," is gaining significant attention on the festival circuit for its unique premise of a dance party set during a vaguely defined apocalypse. Laxe describes the film as a sensorial, cathartic experience intended to be felt rather than intellectually solved, drawing inspiration from his own experiences at raves. Shot in the deserts of Morocco and Spain, the movie follows a father and son searching for a missing daughter amidst the chaos. The film explores themes of crisis, community, and the spiritual power of dance.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting a new all-time Formula 1 speed record, surpassing a benchmark set in 2020. His lap averaged 164.466 mph, breaking the previous record held by Lewis Hamilton. The new record is attributed to a combination of the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced and grippier Monza track, and other track modifications. Verstappen expressed satisfaction with the achievement but remained focused on the upcoming race, acknowledging the challenge from the competitive McLaren team.</p>

          <p>The UK government is advising citizens to "keep their cool" ahead of a nationwide test of its emergency alert system scheduled for Sunday.

This marks the second national test of the system, which is designed to warn the public of life-threatening situations such as extreme weather or terror attacks. The government aims to ensure the system's effectiveness and will assess its performance with mobile network operators afterward.</p>

          <p>A 200-pound bear named Okan at a Turkish wildlife park has become a viral sensation after needing medical treatment for an upset stomach caused by eating too much fruit. Footage showed the bear being transported on a stretcher and undergoing a CT scan at a veterinary facility in Istanbul. After confirming no serious issues, Okan was treated and released back to the park, where he is reportedly happy and recovering. This is the second time the bear has required such care for overindulgence, prompting park staff to adjust his diet.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. State Department to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a new "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, modeled after the existing terrorism sponsor list, to hold foreign governments accountable. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Advocacy groups report at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained abroad in 2024.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a significant reshuffle of his ministerial team, prompted by the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner. Following Yvette Cooper's move from the Home Office to the Foreign Office, ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have also been moved to different departments. The changes are seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration, and to bring in new figures to top departmental roles. Anna Turley has been promoted to attend cabinet and will also serve as Labour Party chair.</p>
