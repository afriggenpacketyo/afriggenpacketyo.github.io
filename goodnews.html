          <p>UCLA's baseball team defeated UC Irvine 8-5 in the Los Angeles Regional final, securing their spot in the NCAA super regionals. The Bruins will host Texas San Antonio, marking their first super regional appearance since 2019. UCLA's offense exploded early, scoring three runs in the first two innings, while Mulivai Levu's three-run home run in the fourth extended their lead. Freshman Wylan Moss delivered a strong pitching performance, and a combined bullpen effort held UC Irvine at bay, despite some late-game complications. If UCLA beats UTSA, it will advance to the College World Series in Omaha for the first time since 2013.</p>
