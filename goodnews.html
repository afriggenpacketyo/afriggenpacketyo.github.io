          <p>Following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks, markets are largely expecting a quarter-percentage point rate cut in September, yet the subsequent path for monetary policy is unclear. While stocks initially rallied, caution emerged as experts debate the pace of future easing, citing ongoing inflation concerns and a resilient economy. Some analysts, like Morgan Stanley, question the urgency for cuts and the potential impact on stocks, recalling unintended consequences from 2024's easing cycle. The article notes that despite market pricing, the long-term effects of rate cuts are uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has maintained a steady union membership rate, ranging from 16% to 18% of its labor force over the past two decades, contrasting with a national decline. This stability is attributed to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at companies like Starbucks. While some sectors, like grocery stores and film production, saw declines, overall union density in the state has held, demonstrating the impact of active union campaigns. Researchers highlight the state's unique success in sustaining labor representation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Autopaying bills offers convenience, but choosing between credit and debit cards involves distinct pros and cons. Credit cards can improve credit scores and offer rewards, providing flexibility if funds are tight before payday. However, they risk accruing interest and late fees if not paid in full, potentially harming credit. Debit cards provide a real-time financial picture and avoid debt, with some companies even incentivizing their use. The main drawback is the risk of non-sufficient funds fees if the account balance is too low. (not investment advice)</p>
