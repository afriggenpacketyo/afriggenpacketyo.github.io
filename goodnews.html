          <h2>Private Japanese Lander Nears Lunar Landing Attempt</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private Japanese lunar lander, Resilience, is approaching its landing on the moon after launching four and a half months ago. The lander carries cameras, scientific instruments, and a tiny rover named Tenacious, intending to explore the lunar surface and deploy a customer payload, a small model of a Swedish house. This mission follows a previous failed attempt by the company in 2023, highlighting the difficulties of low-cost lunar transportation. The Resilience lander aims to be the first private entity to successfully land and complete its mission on the moon, setting the stage for future non-governmental lunar services, following in the footsteps of Firefly Aerospace, which successfully landed its Blue Ghost spacecraft in March. The success of this mission could pave the way for more commercial lunar endeavors. The mission seeks to deploy technology and explore the lunar surface. The optimism score for this article is relatively high, given the anticipation and the technological advancement it represents.</p>

          <p>The original Herm√®s Birkin bag, owned and worn by the late Jane Birkin, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's this summer. This bag, inspired by Birkin's complaint about the lack of suitable bags for daily use during a flight, led to the creation of one of the most coveted fashion accessories. The bag will be on display in New York before being auctioned in Paris, and it represents a unique piece of fashion history. The auction house has not yet provided an estimate for how much the bag could sell for, but its exceptional provenance is expected to draw significant interest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone, claiming they discussed and agreed to a trade deal, resulting in a "very positive conclusion." Trump said U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams will meet soon, and both leaders extended invitations for state visits. The call follows recent trade tensions, including accusations of China violating a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates. Trump believes they "straightened out any complexity" regarding the agreement, focusing on rare earths and magnets. The conversation represents a significant development amid the trade standoff between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has announced the return of its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue it due to fuel economy regulations. The company acknowledges the mistake, responding to customer demand and shifting trends in the auto industry. This decision aligns with a broader trend of automakers reassessing EV adoption plans amid slower-than-expected progress and the Trump administration's efforts to unwind EV initiatives. The Hemi engine is expected to represent a significant portion of Ram 1500 sales, with the Hurricane engine remaining as an option. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO defense ministers have broadly endorsed a plan to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, in response to demands from the U.S. President Donald Trump. The new spending would be used on long-range weapons systems, air defense, and mobile land forces. While most NATO members currently commit to spending at least 2% of GDP on military expenditure, a target which around one third of the alliance still doesn't meet, Germany has accepted in principle the demand from the US that NATO members raise defense budgets to 5% of GDP. Spain has been most vocal in its reluctance to hike spending.</p>
