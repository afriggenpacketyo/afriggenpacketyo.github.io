          <p>At just 20 years old, undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma is set to face his most significant challenge yet against veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. Hailed for his speed, power, and southpaw stance, Itauma has quickly amassed a record of 12 wins with 10 knockouts, drawing considerable hype. A victory over a well-known former title contender like Whyte would serve as a major breakthrough, potentially positioning him for a world title shot within the next year.</p>

          <p>Defining 'life' is more complex than it appears, as explored in a discussion with developmental biologist Crystal Rogers. While simple cases like a kitten (alive) or salt (not alive) are clear, a list of criteria for life runs into challenges with ambiguous cases like viruses. The conversation also delves into futuristic scenarios, such as advanced androids from science fiction, to question and refine the biological and philosophical boundaries of what it means for something to be considered a living thing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI initiatives. The judge stated the guidance created a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful and beneficial speech, though she did not rule on the merits of DEI policies themselves.</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot now faces heightened expectations following a summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116m, fundamentally shifting the team's outlook from rebuilding to dominance. This significant investment means that anything less than a serious challenge for both the domestic title and the Champions League would now be considered a disappointment.</p>
