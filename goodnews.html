          <h2>UK Government Considers Expanding Ocean Bottom Trawling Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:42:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering extending a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets across the seafloor, in English waters. The proposal aims to expand the ban from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, and it aligns with a UN Ocean Conference goal to protect a third of international waters by 2030. The move comes amid warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed, and pressure is building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty.</p>

          <p>Faced with water scarcity and population growth, St. George, Utah, is exploring an unconventional solution: recycling sewage. The city plans to build a wastewater reclamation plant by 2025 to treat effluent for outdoor irrigation, eventually integrating the clean water directly into the drinking supply. This initiative is part of a broader effort to address water challenges in the American West, where overuse and drought are straining the Colorado River. The project is costly, but local leaders see it as the only option for sustainable growth.</p>
