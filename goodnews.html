          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly dropped to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in years. This development, which was lower than analysts' predictions, provides positive news for the ECB.

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood achieved a rare baseball feat by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This marks the first time a player has received four intentional passes in one game since Barry Bonds in 2004. Despite the Angels' strategy to pitch around him, Wood managed to go 1-for-2 with a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings. The accomplishment highlights Wood's formidable presence at the plate this season.</p>

          <p>A new book by historian Greg Grandin, "America, Am√©rica," suggests the U.S. could learn from the democratic traditions of Latin America. The article highlights how many Latin American independence movements and constitutions were founded on collective ideals and social rights, such as abolishing slavery and guaranteeing a social safety net, concepts not explicitly central to the U.S. Constitution. While acknowledging the region's history of political instability, often fueled by U.S. intervention, the analysis posits that Latin America's focus on "the common good" offers a valuable counter-narrative to current political trends in the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, understanding dogs requires recognizing that their primary sense is smell. Unlike humans who are visual creatures, dogs construct their reality from olfactory information, which is constantly in motion and changes over time. Horowitz suggests that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that map their world. This olfactory perception even shapes their sense of time, as the fading scent of a person allows them to register their absence.</p>

          <p>Industry experts suggest that reviving U.S. manufacturing depends more on developing a skilled workforce and adopting new technology than on imposing tariffs. While tariffs are often presented as a tool to boost domestic production, uncertainty surrounding them has actually slowed down reshoring efforts. Panelists at a recent webinar emphasized that the primary hurdles for onshoring are the erosion of the manufacturing workforce and capacity over decades. They proposed solutions like investing in training and creating pathways for skilled immigrants to fill critical labor gaps.</p>
