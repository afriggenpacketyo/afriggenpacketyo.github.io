          <p>Alex Palou became the first Spaniard to win the Indianapolis 500, holding off Marcus Ericsson in the closing laps after a race filled with bizarre incidents. The race saw multiple crashes, including Scott McLaughlin on the warm-up lap and Kyle Larson near the midway point, as well as a pit road incident involving Rinus VeeKay. Josef Newgarden's attempt to win three consecutive Indy 500s ended due to a fuel pump issue, and Ryan Hunter-Reay led for a portion of the race. Palou's victory marks his third IndyCar title in four years, solidifying his place in racing history.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani threw a live batting practice session, marking a significant step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery. This was his first time facing live hitters in a Dodger uniform, throwing 22 pitches with his full repertoire. Ohtani's fastball reached 94-97 mph, and he incorporated his sweeper, showing positive signs of progress. The team anticipates his return to the rotation after the All-Star break, but is proceeding cautiously to ensure his long-term health.</p>
