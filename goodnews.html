          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins voiced support for a recent interest rate cut but expressed a cautious outlook on future reductions, citing persistent inflation risks. While acknowledging a recent shift in the balance of risks, she stated that a "modestly restrictive" policy remains appropriate to ensure price stability without significantly weakening the labor market. Her remarks, made in a highly uncertain economic environment, suggest that further easing of monetary policy this year will be heavily dependent on incoming economic data.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club, led by Jim Cramer, is adding to its positions in Boeing and Costco, citing recent developments as buying opportunities. The club is purchasing Boeing shares following the FAA's decision to ease restrictions on the 737 Max, which is expected to improve the company's free cash flow. Additionally, it is buying Costco shares during a recent pullback, viewing the high-quality retailer as a durable long-term growth story despite a recent dip in stock price.

          <p>According to the 2025 Triennial Central Bank Survey by the Bank for International Settlements, the Chinese yuan's share in global foreign exchange trading has risen to 8.5%, up from 7% in 2022. The currency maintained its position as the world's fifth-most traded, continuing an upward trend as Beijing promotes its international use to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Despite this growth, analysts note that the yuan's international role still lags behind the scale of China's global economic and trade influence.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data highlights 16 major American cities where housing costs consume the smallest portion of residents' median household income. While housing affordability remains a significant strain for many nationwide, these cities stand out for having a more favorable balance, with housing expenses taking up less than 25% of income. The study provides a comparative look at affordability across large metropolitan areas, although it notes that median figures can mask the struggles of lower-income households.</p>

          <p>The city of Berlin plans to rename a central street, Hofjägerallee, after former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017. Kohl is widely regarded as the key architect of German reunification in 1990, a legacy for which he was granted honorary citizenship of Berlin. Public recognition for the late chancellor had been delayed, partly due to a party financing scandal that tarnished the end of his political career, but the renaming marks a formal tribute to his historic role.</p>
