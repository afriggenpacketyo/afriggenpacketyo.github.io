          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocked the order, which had imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients Trump disliked. Howell emphasized the importance of independent lawyers in ensuring a fair judicial system, framing the order as an attack on this principle. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming its commitment to protecting its firm, clients, and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation rather than a replacement of the existing holiday. This clarification came after Trump's initial social media post sparked confusion and debate. Establishing a federal holiday or patriotic observance requires congressional approval. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II."</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Rising Numbers of Autism Diagnoses: Real Increase or Shifting Definitions?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:19:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of autism diagnoses has significantly increased, prompting questions about whether this reflects a genuine rise in cases or evolving diagnostic criteria. Studies indicate an exponential increase in autism diagnoses, but this may be due to broadened definitions and greater awareness, especially among women and adults. The inclusion of Asperger's syndrome and the recognition of autism in females, who often mask their traits, have contributed to higher numbers. While increased diagnoses provide support for many, concerns arise about potential distortions of public perception and tensions within the autistic community regarding representation and understanding.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is advocating for new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials, a move described as a radical departure from past practices. This policy change would require new vaccines to be tested against a placebo to assess safety and efficacy. Concerns arise about the definition of a "new" vaccine and the ethical implications of placebo trials when effective vaccines already exist. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, advocating for placebo-based trials to ensure vaccines do not cause more harm than good.</p>

The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine officials refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports.
