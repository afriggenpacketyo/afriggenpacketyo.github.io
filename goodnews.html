          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of a significant measles outbreak that infected over 700 people, the largest in the state in three decades. The outbreak, which began in January near Gaines County, resulted in nearly 100 hospitalizations and the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The declaration came after 42 days passed without a new case, a standard timeframe based on the virus's incubation period. Despite this positive development, officials warn that vigilance is crucial due to declining vaccination rates and ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>As Labor Day approaches on September 1, 2025, this article serves as a practical guide for the holiday weekend. It outlines the history of the federal holiday, which was established in 1894 to honor the American worker and now marks the unofficial end of summer. The summary details which major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains will remain open, while noting that government services, banks, the stock market, and Costco will be closed. It provides context on the holiday's origins in the labor movement, contrasting it with the modern focus on sales and gatherings.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations for Purchasing Retirement Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits exist for purchasing annuities, a retirement product offering guaranteed income. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, due to risk assessment related to life expectancy. The text explains that the optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific age, though purchasing in one's late 50s to mid-60s is often advised. It provides context on how timing affects payout rates and product availability for those planning their financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing recently hosted the first "World Humanoid Robot Games," a three-day competition that attracted 280 teams from 16 countries. The event featured humanoid robots competing in a variety of events, including martial arts, soccer, and track and field, as well as demonstrating job skills like housekeeping and factory work. Chinese robotics firms like Unitree, a competitor to Tesla's Optimus, performed strongly, aligning with China's national strategy to become a global leader in humanoid robot technology by 2027. The competition serves as a platform to test and refine robotic capabilities, with plans for a second event next year.</p>

          <p>This article examines the nutritional value of popular cereals marketed as healthy in Canada, offering guidance from a registered dietitian. It emphasizes the importance of choosing cereals high in fibre and low in sugar, while also acknowledging that even sugary, fortified cereals can provide essential nutrients for those facing food insecurity or with picky eaters. The text provides a comparative ranking of 11 brands based on calories, fibre, sugar, and protein, highlighting Shredded Wheat as a top choice for its simplicity and lack of sugar. The overall message is that while some cereals are better than others, having breakfast is crucial for daily function.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words in the last year, many of which originate from internet culture, social media, and Gen Z slang. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a versatile but often meaningless term from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a playful shortening of "delusional." Other notable additions include "tradwife," reflecting a controversial social media trend about traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," used to describe powerful male tech leaders. The dictionary's lexical managers note that these additions reflect the significant and fascinating impact of internet culture on the evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflects on his journey to the show, which fulfilled a high school prophecy he once dismissed as incidental. He shares how pop culture, particularly SNL, was a crucial tool for assimilating after moving from French-speaking Canada to Colorado as a child. Yang, who is currently Emmy-nominated, discusses his initial resistance to portraying JD Vance and the meticulous preparation he undertook for the role. He also touches on his popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and the cultural significance of hiding his sister's copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a youth.</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving a defamation lawsuit over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Dominion had alleged that Newsmax knowingly spread lies that its voting machines were used to rig the election against Donald Trump. The settlement was reached before a trial could determine malice, following a judge's prior ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed Dominion. While agreeing to the payment, Newsmax did not apologize and maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced, a claim contradicted by internal communications revealed in the case.</p>

          <p>As President Zelenskyy visits the White House, the scale of U.S. aid to Ukraine is again under examination. This article analyzes the financial contributions, citing data from the Kiel Institute, which reports the U.S. has committed $130.6 billion between January 2022 and June 2025. This figure is contrasted with President Trump's previous, unsubstantiated claim of over $300 billion. While the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, the combined aid from European nations ($165.7 billion) surpasses the U.S. contribution. The report also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mix of grants and loans to support Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has successfully signed 19-year-old winger Ben Doak from Liverpool in a deal worth an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. Doak has signed a five-year contract, seeking more regular first-team football after limited appearances for Liverpool. The Scottish international spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, where he demonstrated his potential with three goals and seven assists. This transfer is part of a larger summer of sales for Liverpool, who have generated approximately £200 million from player departures, helping to balance their spending on new signings.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal JAMA reveals that the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) had historically low rates of financial conflicts of interest at the time its members were fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. The study found that the committee's reported conflict rate had dropped from over 42% in 2000 to just 5% in 2024. This data directly contrasts with Kennedy's justification for the firings, which was based on a dated 2007 report citing widespread conflicts. The research indicates that significant progress has been made in recent years to reduce financial ties to industry on influential vaccine advisory panels.</p>

Furthermore, 41% switched from less effective methods like condoms. The study indicates that the pill is particularly being used by younger, uninsured, and rural individuals, who often face the greatest barriers to accessing prescription healthcare.

Stafford was a full participant in both individual and team drills, showing no obvious limitations, which brought a palpable sense of excitement to the team. However, head coach Sean McVay remained cautious, stating that the team would take Stafford's recovery one day at a time and that it was too early to confirm his readiness for Week 1.</p>
