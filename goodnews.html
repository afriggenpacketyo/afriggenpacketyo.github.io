          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, has dedicated a new monument to acknowledge the 1885 massacre where a mob killed 28 Chinese people amid labor tensions. This statue, 'Requiem,' depicts a Chinese miner and stands as a more prominent memorial than previous efforts. The town is also conducting an archaeological dig at the former Chinatown site, revealing artifacts from the violent past. This initiative aims to shed light on a dark chapter of the town's history, despite a local political climate that has recently seen increased anti-immigrant sentiment and renewed ICE contracts.</p>

          <p>As the Labour Party heads into its annual conference, leader Sir Keir Starmer expressed confidence in his government's ability to 'pull this round' despite trailing Reform UK in opinion polls. He plans to use the Liverpool conference to present Labour as a patriotic alternative to what he calls Reform UK's 'toxic divide and decline' politics, specifically criticizing Nigel Farage. Starmer renewed attacks on Farage, describing him as 'grubby' and 'unpatriotic' for allegedly talking down the UK abroad. The conference will also address Labour's stance on immigration, contrasting with Reform's proposals to abolish indefinite leave to remain.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold its remaining stake, expressing gratitude for the 17-year investment and calling the divestment a 'normal' part of investing. Berkshire had gradually reduced its holdings since 2022, realizing a significant profit of 20 times its initial capital. Despite BYD's calm response, its shares fell over 6% following the news, reflecting investor concerns about cooling growth, price cuts, and a recent quarterly profit decline. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway is expanding its investments in Japanese trading house stocks, increasing its stake in Mitsui and Mitsubishi above 10% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in Cambridgeshire, an experiment driven by climate change and the need for future food security. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and farmers Sarah and Craig Taylor cultivated nine rice varieties, thriving due to the UK's hottest summer on record. This trial, led by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, explores new crops for a changing climate and aims to re-wet peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases. While commercial viability is still risky, the project offers a potential model for sustainable agriculture and emission reduction.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. Their research, stemming from observations in university hostels, found that bacterial buildup in sweaty shoes was the primary cause of odor, leading to shoes being left outside. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that effectively sterilizes footwear, killing microbes and eliminating the 'rotten-cheese-like' smell within minutes. This inventive scientific endeavor, celebrated for making people 'laugh, then think,' offers a practical solution to a universal domestic problem.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an overwhelming 11½-4½ lead over the USA heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half more points for retention. The second day was marred by 'thuggish, moronic and personal insults' from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to increased security and fan removals. European captain Luke Donald acknowledged the crowd's intensity but emphasized his team's resilience in the face of adversity. An incident between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau also added to the day's tension, highlighting the contentious atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's upcoming memoir, 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the 'swing justice.' Kennedy reflects on his decisive votes in controversial cases like same-sex marriage and abortion, asserting 'The cases swung, not me' as the court grew more conservative. He expresses concern about increasing partisanship in American discourse and even in Supreme Court opinions, advocating for reasoned, respectful conversation. Kennedy also shares personal anecdotes, including a surprising friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia and his evolution on issues like juvenile death penalties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, with experts debating their scientific credibility. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen peptides reaching skin cells intact. She notes that industry-funded studies often show positive results, contrasting with independent research that finds no significant effect. Experts emphasize that lifestyle factors like sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking have a far greater impact on skin health than expensive supplements. Laser stimulation and microneedling are suggested as more effective, albeit costly, alternatives for boosting collagen output.</p>
