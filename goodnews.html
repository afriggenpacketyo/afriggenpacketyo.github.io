          <h2>China Implements Broad Policy Easing Measures Amid Trade Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 23:53:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced widespread policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These actions aim to stimulate economic growth amidst trade tensions, with the central bank governor noting borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates. The policies also target support for key sectors like technology and real estate, including establishing a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. Analysts suggest these measures indicate urgency to bolster the economy, though new fiscal policies may be needed for concrete signs of economic deterioration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 23:35:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New legislation in England and Wales proposes additional prison time for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. Under the Victims and Courts Bill, offenders could face up to two extra years in prison, and those already serving whole life orders could be confined to their cells and lose privileges. Families of sexual assault and murder victims, whose perpetrators did not attend sentencing, have advocated for the change, viewing it as a step in the right direction for justice. The Prime Minister has pledged to follow through on the legislation, which aims to ensure offenders cannot "opt out" of facing the consequences of their actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades will now be included in a federally funded debris removal program after initial exclusion, according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath. This decision brings residents closer to potentially returning home, providing certainty that the government will clear their properties. The determination of who would pay for debris removal has been a major factor in deciding whether to rebuild Tahitian Terrace. The park owners, Azul Pacifico Inc., cited their limited insurance coverage and monthly income as obstacles to completing the cleanup independently.</p>

          <p>China's tourism sector is experiencing a surge in domestic travel, defying concerns about a broader consumption slowdown. During the recent May Labor Day holiday, domestic tourist trips surpassed pre-COVID levels, with a notable increase in visits to smaller cities and rural areas. This growth is fueled by improved transportation infrastructure and a rising interest in cultural activities. While retail sales have remained tepid, the services sector, including tourism, is showing faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Miami Marlins in extra innings, with their bullpen fatigue becoming a costly problem.

Journeyman reliever JP Feyereisen gave up the walk-off single to Jes√∫s Sanchez in the 10th inning. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use less appealing pitching options due to workload concerns, highlighting the strain on the Dodgers' bullpen.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Throne Labs to install four "smart" public restrooms throughout the city, featuring QR code access, digital signage, and a 10-minute time limit. The restrooms aim to address gaps in public restroom availability in high-traffic areas. The city will analyze data on usage, duration, and cleanliness to determine whether to continue the program. The time limit is intended to discourage loitering and provide a safety measure, as it allows for quick intervention in case of medical emergencies.</p>
