          <p>As China prioritizes scientific advancement and a hi-tech workforce, the role of humanities in the country's education system is being reevaluated, with some universities reducing arts and social science enrollments in favor of STEM fields. Despite concerns about the perceived lack of utility of humanities in the modern economy, some observers argue that these fields are essential for preserving the complexity and diversity of human civilization. Humanities are evolving to incorporate AI and other technologies, leading to new interdisciplinary fields. The article notes that the value of liberal arts lies in addressing fundamental issues that technological advancements alone cannot solve.</p>

Cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, and international relations, particularly dealing with Donald Trump, were key issues in the campaign. The victory is a turnaround from earlier polls that indicated low approval ratings for Albanese, reflecting a successful campaign focused on healthcare, housing, climate change, and reconciliation with First Nations people.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the renowned CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his intention to step down from his role by the end of the year, stunning shareholders at the company's annual meeting. Greg Abel, the chief of Berkshire's energy unit, is expected to succeed Buffett, who will remain with the business in some capacity. The announcement marks the end of Buffett's six-decade tenure at the helm of the conglomerate, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.2 trillion titan. Buffett's departure raises questions about the future of Berkshire's investment strategy, particularly following the death of Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida lawmakers are attempting to balance condo safety regulations with the financial burden on condo owners following the 2021 Surfside collapse. New legislation aims to provide relief by extending deadlines for structural integrity inspections and allowing condo associations a two-year grace period for fully funding reserves. The bill also enables condo associations to secure loans and lines of credit for repairs with member approval. The original law, enacted after the Surfside tragedy, mandated strict inspections and fully funded reserves for older buildings, leading to steep special assessments and slowed condo sales statewide. Lawmakers acknowledge that further attention may be needed in future sessions to refine the safety measures.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly focused on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing and adopting robotics on a commercial scale, which could power its future economic growth. This focus comes as demographic headwinds, such as a decreasing working-age population, begin to impact economies globally. By 2100, China's working-age population could shrink significantly, necessitating increased productivity gains through AI and robotics. The article highlights that Chinese policymakers view AI differently, focusing on its practical application in manufacturing rather than solely on competition with the US.</p>

          <p>An election is underway to incorporate a new city, Starbase, dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, on the southern tip of Texas. The proposed city, formerly known as Boca Chica Village, would establish a local government with control over planning, taxation, and other local issues. While most of the eligible voters are SpaceX employees, some nearby residents oppose the measure, citing environmental concerns. If approved, Starbase would be a Type C city, allowing officials to levy property taxes and potentially close a local highway, limiting access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints secured a remarkable 37-34 victory over Leinster in Dublin, earning them a place in the Investec Champions Cup final. Tommy Freeman's hat-trick led the charge for the Saints, who overcame three yellow cards and a late refereeing controversy to secure the win. Despite Leinster's strong performance and the home crowd's support, Northampton's defensive stand in the final moments sealed their place in the final. The Saints will now face the winner of the Toulouse versus Bordeaux-Begles match in Cardiff.</p>
