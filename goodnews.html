          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed accepting online orders after suspending purchases on its website in April due to a significant cyberattack. Shoppers can now purchase a selection of clothing and home products for delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales. The retailer plans to expand the available products and restore click-and-collect and delivery services to Northern Ireland in the coming weeks. The cyberattack had disrupted services, leading to empty shelves and delivery delays, making the restoration of online shopping a crucial step for the company. The incident highlights the increasing need for retailers to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect customer data and prevent operational disruptions, as cyberattacks can have severe financial and reputational consequences. Optimism about the full recovery of M&S's online services is cautiously high, contingent on the successful implementation of enhanced security protocols.</p>

          <p>German police have declared that membership in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is incompatible with service in the police force. Meanwhile, the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig is hearing a case regarding the ban on the right-wing extremist magazine Compact. The Interior Ministry had banned Compact, describing it as a central mouthpiece of the right-wing extremist scene, but the court temporarily lifted the ban due to doubts about its proportionality. This case highlights the ongoing debate in Germany about the extent to which the government can restrict freedom of speech in order to combat extremism, as well as the challenges of balancing civil liberties with the need to protect democratic values. The final decision regarding the ban is pending.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the farm minister expecting the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, raising concerns about emergency preparedness, but the government maintains that the remaining reserve is sufficient. The decision comes amid public frustration over rice shortages and price increases, with suspicions that some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price hikes.

          <p>China is leveraging its housing provident fund, valued at 10.9 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion), to support its struggling housing sector by offering an alternative to bank mortgages. The fund has become a significant source of financing, outpacing banks in mortgage lending, as banks become more cautious due to profit challenges. This move aims to help turn around the ailing property market and counter external shocks. However, some analysts are skeptical that easing financing needs will be sufficient to cement a housing recovery, as the effort may not address the underlying shortage of demand.

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is lagging behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, especially in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that current efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. Japan's ranking of 118th out of 146 economies in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index highlights the need for intensified efforts to promote gender equality. The government plans to step up measures to ensure women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various fields, focusing on local economies and small businesses.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. This expansion aims to offset losses from high US tariffs, with shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia growing by double-digit percentages. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping to factory sites in Southeast Asia to produce finished goods for local sale or re-export, including to the US. This diversification of exports underscores the evolving economic and investment relations between China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>

The proposed sale has also drawn attention from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has expressed a desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal.
