          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) experienced an engine problem during a flight, prompting an emergency alert and a precautionary return to its base. The iconic World War II aircraft, one of only two still airworthy, was seen with black smoke coming from one of its four engines. The RAF confirmed the crew diagnosed an "unusual engine behaviour" and landed safely without any injuries. An investigation into the incident has been launched to determine the cause of the engine malfunction.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has announced that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to protect players from high temperatures. This decision follows concerns about player welfare raised during the recent Club World Cup in the US, where some described the heat as dangerous. The strategy will primarily involve stadiums in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver. Infantino also declared the Club World Cup a major financial success, generating over $2 billion in revenue for the organization.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on major trading partners like the EU and Mexico, the U.S. stock market has shown resilience, avoiding the panic seen in previous instances. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating tactics and are focusing on broader economic fundamentals. Key themes supporting market optimism include the administration's deregulatory stance, which fosters M&A activity, and its relatively hands-off approach to the rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector. These factors are seen as driving corporate earnings and outweighing the immediate concerns over trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

His consent in court paves the way for the transfer, which requires final approval from Ecuador's president. This would make him the first Ecuadorian extradited under a new law passed to aid the government's war on criminal gangs.</p>
