          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85. Souter, despite being a Republican appointee, became a consistent member of the court's liberal wing, often frustrating Republicans with his alignment with liberal justices on key issues. He played a crucial role in reaffirming Roe v. Wade and dissenting in Bush v. Gore. After retiring in 2009, Souter returned to his home state of New Hampshire but continued to serve on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, leaving a legacy of judicial independence and intellectual rigor.</p>

          <p>Hilaria Baldwin seemingly calls out Amy Schumer in her new book for making jokes about Baldwin's Spanish heritage, though Baldwin does not mention Schumer by name. Baldwin claims the scrutiny left her physically ill with stress and brought her children to tears, as she felt Schumer was inherently cruel. Schumer previously poked fun at Baldwin's heritage in a Netflix special, questioning Baldwin's accent and Spanish-sounding names, alluding to the controversy surrounding Baldwin's claims of Spanish heritage. Baldwin has since apologized for the confusion and admitted culture can be fluid.</p>

Through historical garments, portraits, and contemporary fashion, the exhibition examines the significance of clothing in the African diaspora and the evolution of Black dandyism.

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a limited trade agreement that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. However, many UK goods will still be subject to Trump's 10% import tariff. The agreement also includes pharmaceuticals and a digital trade deal, but food standards will remain unchanged.</p>

          <p>The UK government has assured that hormone-treated beef will not enter the UK market following a trade deal with the US. The government insists that existing food standards will not change and that border checks will be implemented to ensure compliance. This assurance comes amid concerns from farmers and consumers about the potential influx of hormone-treated beef from the US, a practice banned in the UK since 1989. The trade deal allows for increased beef imports from the US up to 13,000 metric tonnes tariff-free, in exchange for similar access for UK beef in the US market.</p>

          <p>While the recent trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom might provide a political boost for President Donald Trump, analysts believe it's unlikely to significantly influence China's stance in upcoming trade talks. The US-UK deal, which maintains Washington‚Äôs 10% tariffs on imports from Britain while increasing agricultural access and easing duties on UK car shipments, is seen as largely symbolic. Experts suggest that China's approach to negotiations will remain unchanged, irrespective of the US-UK agreement.</p>

The scholarship, funded by the Western Golf Association, covers tuition and housing expenses for four years. The students were selected based on academic excellence, financial need, dedication to caddying, and character.
