          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock increase by 5% after the company significantly raised its long-term financial outlook during an analyst meeting. The computer manufacturer now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, up from a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. This optimistic revision is driven by strong customer demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, where Dell positions itself as a key solutions leader. The company, a major customer of Nvidia, is capitalizing on the AI boom to fuel its growth and shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>

She has garnered significant support, including endorsements from a dozen former presidential candidates and has been actively engaging with the Cameroonian diaspora in Europe.

          <p>Arsenal has given goalkeeper David Raya an improved contract, reflecting his key role in the team under manager Mikel Arteta. The new deal provides the Spanish international with a significant pay increase on the terms he agreed to when his move from Brentford was made permanent. While his salary has risen, the contract length remains the same, expiring in 2028 with an option to extend. This move follows a similar quiet contract improvement for teammate Leandro Trossard and comes as Arsenal is also in advanced talks to renew contracts for Jurrien Timber and Bukayo Saka.</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the overall number of homes sold has decreased, the investor share has grown, highlighting their significant role in providing liquidity to a weaker market. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate this space, accounting for over 90% of the market. In contrast, large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters, often shifting capital towards build-to-rent communities rather than exiting the market entirely.

          <h2>Ares Management Capitalizes on Growing Retail Investor Interest in Alternative Assets</h2>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Ares Management has increased its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, citing unexpectedly strong momentum from individual wealthy investors. CEO Michael Arougheti highlighted this 'retail revolution' as a key driver of growth, with Ares already managing over $50 billion from retail-focused vehicles. The firm is countering the narrative that retail investors receive lower-quality deals, asserting that its investments are allocated across both institutional and wealth platforms. This trend reflects a broader shift in capital markets, as individual investors seek diversification away from increasingly concentrated public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has denied reports that she turned down an offer to perform at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. Speaking on 'The Tonight Show,' the superstar clarified that while her team has had informal conversations with Jay-Z's Roc Nation, which produces the show, no official offer was ever made or rejected. Swift explained that during the football season, her focus is entirely on supporting her fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce, and she cannot imagine planning a massive performance while he is competing. Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny has since been confirmed as the performer for Super Bowl LX.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization has raised its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, a significant increase from its previous 0.9% estimate. This optimistic revision is attributed to strong import demand in the U.S., favorable macroeconomic conditions, and a surge in demand for AI-related goods like semiconductors. However, the outlook for 2026 is less positive, with the WTO slashing its growth prediction from 1.8% to just 0.5%. The anticipated slowdown is due to a cooling global economy and the delayed but full impact of widespread trade tariffs, particularly those implemented by the United States.

The South African athlete, who was born with a difference of sexual development (DSD), stated 'it's never the end' and that her team is still deciding on the next steps following a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights. Semenya has been in a years-long battle against regulations that would require her to take testosterone-suppressing drugs to compete in certain female events, a policy she argues is discriminatory and violates human rights.</p>

Their work in the 1980s on electrical circuits demonstrated phenomena like 'macroscopic quantum tunnelling,' which has become a foundational principle for building today's powerful quantum computers. The Nobel committee highlighted that their discoveries are essential to the development of quantum technology, which underpins many modern devices. The three laureates, who expressed their surprise at the honor, will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor.</p>

The decision to proceed, made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, comes after months of delays caused by a funding dispute between the Pentagon and Congress. The F/A-XX is considered a crucial component of U.S. military strategy to counter China, and the new jets are expected to enter service in the 2030s.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first six months of 2025, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. This 'historic shift' was driven by rapid growth in solar and wind power, particularly in large economies like China and India, which are now meeting new electricity demand with clean energy. The analysis indicates a crucial turning point where clean energy expansion is beginning to outpace the growth in global electricity consumption. However, the report also noted that the U.S. and EU saw a temporary increase in fossil fuel use due to specific regional factors.</p>

          <p>Laura Modi, CEO of infant formula startup Bobbie, is challenging the long-standing duopoly of Abbott and Reckitt in the U.S. market. Inspired by her own frustrating experience as a new mother, Modi founded Bobbie in 2018 to offer a higher-quality, organic product and change the culture around formula feeding. The company gained significant traction following the 2022 nationwide formula shortage, which exposed the risks of a highly concentrated supply chain. Bobbie's strategy combines a direct-to-consumer subscription model with a mission-driven marketing approach, focusing on advocacy for issues like paid family leave rather than just product sales.</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), current market conditions with declining interest rates have made borrowing more affordable. A $75,000 HELOC now costs approximately $712 per month for a 15-year term, down from about $777 in August 2024 when rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even cheaper if the Federal Reserve continues to cut rates as expected later this year. This makes them an attractive financing option for homeowners needing a large sum of money, as they can benefit from future rate drops without needing to refinance. (not investment advice)</p>
