          <p>Josh Hobbs and Hannah Lloyd-Hobbs, a couple on vacation from Wales, heroically saved the lives of six people, including four children and an 18-month-old baby, after witnessing a boat explosion on the River Thames. Hearing desperate cries, they immediately jumped into the river to rescue the passengers who were struggling to swim, with Hannah rescuing the baby. The explosion, which was heard for miles, drew a crowd that assisted in pulling everyone from the water and providing first aid until air ambulance crews arrived. Nine people were hospitalized, and police praised the couple's bravery, emphasizing it was a miracle there were no fatalities.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured on Friday after escaping from an Arkansas prison on May 25, where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault.

          <p>A decade-long study interviewing parents of highly successful children revealed five key strategies: fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than coaching. Parents who encouraged a sense of possibility and tailored their approach based on their child's interests saw greater academic success. The study also emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and everyday learning, moving away from a focus on hard work towards fostering curiosity and a genuine love of learning. Ultimately, the most effective parents supported their children with love and joy, acting as supporters rather than critics.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from the England squad for the upcoming match against Andorra, with coach Thomas Tuchel expected to experiment with the starting lineup. Saka's omission is likely due to fitness concerns, as he has only completed one full training session this week. Other potential changes to the squad include Reece James possibly playing left-back and Cole Palmer potentially making his debut. The article also notes that Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins have been left out of the matchday party, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury.</p>

Drawing from his own career path, which included roles in sportscasting, investment banking, and retail, Jassy emphasized the importance of discovering what one doesn't want to do as much as what one does. He credited his success to his willingness to find out what he was good at and what he liked, rather than doggedly following a strong vision of what he wanted to do. Jassy also highlighted the significance of reliability, trustworthiness, and a strong work ethic in achieving success.</p>

          <p>The NHS app in England is set to become the primary method of communication for millions more patients, with a ¬£50 million investment aimed at sending test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones. This shift away from traditional letters is projected to save the health service ¬£200 million over the next three years, as at least 50 million letters are sent to patients annually. While those without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, the goal is to improve patient access to healthcare management and free up NHS phone lines.

          <p>The age-adjusted death rate for cancer in the US has significantly decreased since 1991, largely due to advancements in treatments and prevention efforts.

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison, triggering a nearly two-week-long manhunt. Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and rape, was apprehended 1.5 miles northwest of the prison. The escape prompted an investigation into a security lapse that allowed Hardin to impersonate a corrections officer, and the search involved bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and an elite U.S. Border Patrol team. Hardin's capture brought relief to the community, particularly to the family of one of his victims.</p>

          <h2>Morgan Stanley Upgrades MP Materials as Top Pick for Rare Earths Investment</h2>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has upgraded MP Materials, a rare-earth miner, citing its growing strategic value to the U.S. amid geopolitical tensions with China, which dominates the global market for rare earth refining and processing. The investment bank projects a significant upside for MP Materials' stock, driven by increasing demand for critical minerals and the company's position as the most vertically integrated rare earths company outside of China. MP Materials owns the only operating rare earth mine in the U.S. and is developing a fully domestic supply chain, positioning it to benefit from government support and the growing market for electric vehicle motors and humanoid robots (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Passing Nurses Save Woman's Life After Sudden Cardiac Arrest in New York City</h2>

          <p>Two nurses, Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, saved the life of Merryl Hoffman after she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest outside Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Hoffman, who had a history of heart health monitoring, collapsed due to a severe arrhythmia, and the nurses immediately performed CPR, keeping her heart manually beating until an ambulance arrived. Hoffman underwent surgery and received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, later reuniting with the nurses who saved her life and expressing her gratitude for their life-saving actions. Early CPR, as performed by the nurses, significantly increases survival rates for patients in cardiac arrest.</p>
