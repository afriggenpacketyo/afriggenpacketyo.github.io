          <h2>New Study Reveals Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 14:44:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major two-year study involving over 2,100 older Americans provides strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and cognitive training can significantly enhance thinking and memory. Participants in the intensive program, known as the POINTER study, demonstrated cognitive function scores comparable to individuals one to two years younger. These findings, presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, suggest that such lifestyle interventions can effectively slow the cognitive declines typically associated with aging. Researchers and health organizations are now focused on translating these results into accessible community programs.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel, the departing music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is set to return to the Hollywood Bowl for a one-week engagement in August. This appearance is notable as it is one of his last during his penultimate season before he moves to the New York Philharmonic. The program is diverse, featuring works by Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, showcasing the influence of American jazz on European classical music. He will also conduct Mahler's Symphony No. 1 and John Williams' iconic score for a live screening of "Jurassic Park," offering a final opportunity for many Angelenos to see him conduct at the famous venue.</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Scotland, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer shared a new European-led peace plan for Gaza with U.S. President Donald Trump. The proposal was developed in collaboration with France and Germany after U.S.-led negotiations stalled. While details remain undisclosed pending a UK cabinet meeting, the plan aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. The diplomatic push comes amid increasing international pressure and a call from 255 UK MPs for the immediate recognition of Palestinian statehood, a move the government has described as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

          <p>Shareholders of Wise, a major UK financial technology company valued at around £11 billion, have voted to move its main stock market listing to the United States. The company argued the move will increase its visibility in the U.S., its largest market, and provide access to deeper capital markets. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a dual-class share structure that gives enhanced voting rights to its co-founder and CEO, Kristo Käärmann. Despite some opposition, the proposal passed with a strong majority, and the U.S. listing is expected to be effective in the second quarter of next year.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it will split into two independent entities, named Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, in a move that unwinds their troubled three-year merger. The Warner Bros. company will retain the film and television studios, HBO, and gaming properties, with CEO David Zaslav at the helm. Discovery Global will encompass the cable networks like CNN and HGTV, led by current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. This corporate demerger acknowledges that the initial consolidation failed to deliver value and left the combined company struggling with over $40 billion in debt amid a challenging media landscape.</p>

          <p>The United States is currently in the process of significantly overhauling its system for providing disaster relief. This transformation is driven by the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, such as the series of hurricanes and storms that devastated areas like Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, five years ago. The article suggests a shift in how the federal government, often personified by FEMA, responds to and funds recovery efforts in disaster-stricken regions. The goal is to create a more efficient and effective framework for rebuilding communities impacted by catastrophic events, moving beyond traditional models of assistance.</p>

          <p>The 2025 trade negotiations between the U.S. and the EU have been a volatile process, culminating in a last-minute deal. The talks began with President Trump imposing steep tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, prompting the EU to prepare countermeasures. Trump's tariff threats escalated from 20% to as high as 50% before he agreed to several delays to allow for negotiations. After months of tense discussions and internal EU division, the two sides reached an agreement for a 15% baseline tariff, narrowly averting a full-scale trade war that many feared would destabilize the global economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to nutrition expert Dr. Layne Norton, rapid weight loss can be an effective and sustainable strategy, particularly for individuals with higher body fat percentages. In a discussion with Andrew Huberman, Norton explained that research indicates obese individuals who lose more weight early are more likely to maintain the loss long-term. This is partly due to a psychological "buy-in" effect from seeing early results. He clarified that the more body fat a person has, the more aggressively they can cut calories without risking significant muscle loss. However, this approach is not recommended for those who are already lean.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market showed significant strength in June, with five of the nation's top ten most expensive home sales occurring in California. The month's top sale was Mark Wahlberg's former Beverly Hills mansion, which was flipped for $63 million to Paris Hilton and her husband, Carter Reum. Brokers attribute the market's vitality to demand from buyers displaced by recent wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China. Another notable transaction was the $32 million sale of a spec home to Fashion Nova CEO Richard Saghian, further fueling confidence in the high-end market.</p>
