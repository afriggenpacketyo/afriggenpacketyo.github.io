          <p>Contrary to claims from some health policy advocates, the current generation of Americans is not the "sickest in history." This article presents evidence showing dramatic long-term improvements in public health, including a near doubling of life expectancy since the late 19th century due to vaccines, cleaner environments, and safer workplaces. While acknowledging modern health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the analysis argues that historical context reveals a much healthier present compared to a past where infectious diseases were rampant and child mortality was staggeringly high.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is pressuring Performance Food Group to explore a merger with its competitor, US Foods. Sachem Head has nominated four new candidates to the company's board, arguing that a combination could unlock between $800 million and $1 billion in annual synergies, based on a previous attempt by Sysco to acquire US Foods. The firm suggests that such a deal would create significant value for shareholders and that the current regulatory environment under the Trump administration might be more favorable to approval than in the past.

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares, but it remains unclear if the investment is profitable for Warren Buffett's firm. The stock was purchased during the second quarter when prices fluctuated significantly, meaning Berkshire's position could be either in the red or showing a substantial gain depending on the exact timing. Despite the stock's recent rally, it is still down for the year, though some analysts are raising their price targets, citing conviction in the company's turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the difficult prognosis, medical advances have turned this once-fatal diagnosis into a more manageable, long-term condition for many.

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are increasingly losing breakfast customers to "food-forward" convenience stores, which saw a 9% rise in morning traffic compared to fast-food's 1% increase in a recent three-month period. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are successfully competing by offering expanded and quality food options, leveraging the high traffic from morning commuters stopping for gas. This trend is challenging fast-food giants like McDonald's, which has acknowledged that the breakfast period is its weakest and most economically sensitive part of the day, as stressed consumers often opt to eat at home.</p>

          <p>China's cabinet, the State Council, has vowed to implement practical measures to support and safeguard private investment, aiming to restore confidence in the sector. In a meeting chaired by Premier Li Qiang, officials emphasized that private investment is crucial for stabilizing both employment and the overall economy. Proposed measures include expanding market access for private enterprises, particularly in emerging sectors and new infrastructure, and increasing financial support through central budget allocations. The government also plans to reserve a quota of its procurement contracts specifically for small and medium-sized private companies.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Laments the Potential Return of Skinny Jeans Amidst Cyclical Fashion Trends</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article humorously critiques the cyclical nature of fashion, focusing on recent suggestions that skinny jeans are making a comeback. The author expresses a personal disdain for denim and questions the fashion media's role in pressuring consumers to constantly buy new clothes by declaring old styles alternately "in" or "out." The piece argues that individuals should wear what makes them comfortable rather than chasing trends dictated by an industry driven by profit. It uses the skinny jeans debate as a broader commentary on consumerism and the loss of individual style.</p>

          <p>Oracle experienced a historic stock surge this week, driven by its massive cloud computing contracts with OpenAI, highlighting the AI company's significant influence across the tech industry. Reports indicate OpenAI has agreed to spend hundreds of billions on computing power with Oracle over the next several years, causing Oracle's backlog of contracted revenue to soar to $455 billion. This spending spree is also a major factor in the success of other tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom. However, some analysts express concern over the concentration of business tied to a single, cash-burning private company.</p>

          <p>According to Google Flights, the single most effective advice for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel plans. Data analysis shows that flying on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday is, on average, 13% cheaper than traveling on the weekend. Shifting travel dates by even a day or two can result in significant savings. The article also debunks the myth that the day of the week you book your ticket matters, stating that the day you actually fly is far more important for pricing. Traveling during a destination's off-season is another key strategy for reducing costs.</p>

          <p>Obtaining the latest COVID-19 vaccine has become more complicated due to new FDA guidelines that limit approval to individuals 65 and older or those at high risk of severe illness. This is a shift from previous years when the vaccine was available to everyone over 6 months old. To get a shot, individuals may now need to "self-attest" to having a qualifying risk factor, such as asthma, diabetes, or mental health conditions, when making an appointment. The article clarifies the list of risk factors and notes that insurance coverage and availability may vary until the CDC issues its final recommendations.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a controversial panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group's report, which was criticized by many independent scientists for misrepresenting climate science, was used by the EPA to support rolling back regulations on climate pollution. The decision to dissolve the group comes amid a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations alleging the panel was created in secret and violated federal law. Wright stated the group's purpose of catalyzing debate had been achieved.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural and social legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined much of East German architecture. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings housed a quarter of the GDR's population and created a shared collective memory. After German reunification, however, they became symbols of economic decline and social problems, including a rise in extremist violence. The exhibition aims to present a nuanced view of these structures as both architectural heritage and sites of painful historical transformation.</p>
