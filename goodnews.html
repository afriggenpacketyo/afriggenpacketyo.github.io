        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) provide an opportunity to earn higher returns than current inflation rates, helping savings maintain their buying power. These accounts allow individuals to lock in interest rates for the term of the CD, offering a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. While national average CD rates vary by term, online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, *And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America*, makes a compelling argument for recognizing housing as a human right to address the homelessness crisis in the United States. The book examines the origins of the crisis, how it has been perpetuated through inadequate responses, and potential solutions, incorporating personal stories and legal insights. Foscarinis challenges the narrative that homelessness is a personal failure, arguing instead that it is a policy failure stemming from systemic inequality and inadequate support. The book advocates for the "Housing First" model, prioritizing stable housing as the initial intervention, and emphasizes the need for political will to implement effective solutions and enshrine housing as a fundamental human right.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage rates are around 6.97% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.14% for a 15-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.90% for a 30-year refinance and 6.17% for a 15-year refinance. Experts suggest that rates may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, providing some relief to borrowers. To secure a favorable rate, it's crucial to strengthen credit profiles by paying bills on time and comparing offers from multiple lenders. Factors to consider when choosing a mortgage or refinance loan include the loan term, fees, and overall costs, ensuring affordability and long-term financial benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a U-turn on winter fuel payment eligibility, expanding the number of people who will receive the allowance this year. The previous policy, which limited the payment to those receiving pension credit, was widely criticized for excluding millions of pensioners. While details of the changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns about those with slightly higher incomes who still struggle with energy costs. The decision to means-test the payment was initially one of the first major policies after Labour's election victory, but the government is now working on a revised system to provide clarity and support to more pensioners.

          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is significantly motivated by negative emotions, particularly a fear of failure, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. Despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, Huang's anxiety drives him to work harder and achieve more. Witt's interviews with Huang and his colleagues revealed that Huang becomes uncomfortable when things are going well, constantly pushing himself to avoid complacency. This unique perspective challenges the typical image of successful CEOs as upbeat and optimistic, highlighting the role of negative emotions in driving innovation and success.</p>
