          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The company announced that discussions were terminated because JD.com sought to proceed only on a "materially revised set of terms." Sainsbury's concluded that accepting these new terms would not be in the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, the supermarket chain reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying operating profit of around £1 billion by the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has claimed the men's 100m world title in Tokyo, becoming the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m final since Usain Bolt in 2016. The 24-year-old sprinter, who trains with Bolt's former coach Glen Mills, delivered a personal best of 9.77 seconds to secure the gold medal. The victory marks a significant moment for Jamaican athletics, especially after Seville faced disappointment in previous major championships. His triumph, celebrated by an emotional Bolt in the stands, suggests a potential shift in sprinting dominance back to the Caribbean nation.</p>

In a speech, she paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and warned against internal divisions that could benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage. The contest is seen by some as a reflection on the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations. Phillipson will be competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the influential party position.</p>

          <p>Actress Kathy Bates has responded to critics who attribute her significant weight loss to the medication Ozempic. The 77-year-old Oscar winner clarified that her journey to losing 100 pounds took years of hard work, primarily motivated by a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. While she acknowledged that Ozempic helped her lose the final 15 to 20 pounds, she emphasized that the majority of her transformation was the result of a long-term commitment to changing her lifestyle and diet. Bates is currently nominated for an Emmy for her leading role in the reboot of "Matlock."</p>

          <p>Liverpool's perfect start to the Premier League season has been characterized by a series of dramatic, late-game goals, drawing comparisons to the famous "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past. Now dubbed "Arne Time" under manager Arne Slot, the team has won all four of its league matches with decisive goals scored in the final minutes of play. This pattern has established a psychological advantage for Liverpool, creating an aura of inevitability that they will find a way to win, even when not playing at their best. This resilience and winning mentality are seen as ominous signs for their title challengers.</p>

          <p>Data from NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission has revealed crucial information for future planetary defense efforts. When the DART spacecraft intentionally collided with the asteroid Dimorphos, it ejected over 35 million pounds of rock and dust. This plume of debris created a rocket-like effect, providing a much greater push to alter the asteroid's orbit than the impact alone. The experiment confirmed that Dimorphos is a loosely-bound "rubble pile," a structure common among near-Earth asteroids, indicating that this ejecta effect will be a critical factor in designing future asteroid deflection missions.</p>
