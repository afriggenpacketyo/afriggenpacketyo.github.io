          <p>SK Hynix shares have reached a two-decade high following reports that SK Group intends to construct South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. This surge reflects the company's growing dominance in the high bandwidth memory (HBM) market, crucial for AI servers, where it holds a 70% revenue share. SK Hynix has surpassed Samsung in the overall DRAM market, demonstrating its successful capitalization on the AI boom, while Samsung struggles with its market capitalization hitting a 9-year low. The planned data center is expected to further solidify SK Hynix's position in the AI sector.</p>

          <h2>Japan Increases Arms Exports Amid Security Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist stance, is increasingly focusing on arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. This shift is driven by security concerns and a desire to bolster its domestic defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapons imports. By exporting arms, Japan aims to achieve economies of scale, lower production costs, and reduce dependence on the U.S. for defense equipment, especially given the potential for a more transactional approach from the U.S. under a Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is warning that patients who film their medical treatment for platforms like TikTok and Instagram may be endangering themselves and NHS staff.
