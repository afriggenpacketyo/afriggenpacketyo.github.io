          <p>Leicester City is under investigation by an independent commission after allegedly breaching financial regulations during their time in the Championship in the 2023-24 season, according to the article. The Premier League initially couldn't punish the Foxes for breaching profit and sustainability rules in the 2022-23 season due to their relegation. The commission will also assess alleged failures to provide accounts and cooperate with Premier League inquiries. Leicester intends to cooperate with the investigation now that the Premier League's jurisdiction has been established. This follows their relegation to the Championship for the second time in three years.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities, despite stylistic differences. Both men positioned themselves against the political establishment and embraced conservative ideas centered on the individual. Reagan, like Trump, challenged the status quo, advocating for policies such as tax cuts, a strong national defense, and pro-life stances. The author contends that both leaders resonated with blue-collar voters and possessed a strong sense of humor, while emphasizing their commitment to acting on conservative principles. The article suggests that the Republican Party has embraced a cluster of issues brought forth by Reagan and pursued by Trump, all centered on the importance of the individual.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been dormant for two decades, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft, the article reports. The decision to revisit the primary thrusters came as the backup system showed signs of potential failure, with concerns about fuel line residue buildup. With a critical ground-based radio antenna scheduled to go offline for upgrades, engineers risked activating the dormant thruster, despite the potential for a catastrophic explosion. The successful test ensures the spacecraft's antenna remains pointed at Earth, extending its operational lifespan, as the Voyager team aims to celebrate the spacecraft's 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>Israel has recovered thousands of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, according to the New York Times article. The trove includes documents, photographs, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time undercover in Syria. The Mossad worked with an allied foreign government to retrieve the archives. The announcement comes after President Trump's meeting with the president of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia. While the goal of recovering Cohen's remains remains elusive, the recovered items were received as a unifying moment in Israel.</p>
