          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to María Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in Venezuela. Currently in hiding, Machado was praised as a key unifying figure for the country's political opposition against the autocratic regime of President Nicolas Maduro. The announcement highlights her courage and commitment to achieving a peaceful transition to a representative government despite facing serious personal threats. The award, which includes over one million U.S. dollars, has drawn praise from Venezuelan opposition figures and criticism from the Trump White House.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has removed previous restrictions on cryptocurrency investments, making them accessible to all its wealth management clients regardless of their assets or risk tolerance. Starting October 15, financial advisors can offer crypto funds, including those in retirement accounts, a significant shift from the previous policy. The firm will use an automated system to monitor client allocations, recommending a maximum of 4% in crypto assets depending on investment goals. This move reflects a broader trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing digital assets following a change in the U.S. government's stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is focusing on energizing voters in southern New Jersey to overcome his Democratic opponent's lead in the polls. The article suggests that if current polls are as inaccurate as they were in recent election cycles, Ciattarelli might already be ahead. A key strategy is to foster high voter enthusiasm in the region's rural and exurban areas to drive turnout, which could counteract the Democrats' ground game in more densely populated northern cities. Ciattarelli's campaign aims to maintain a positive focus on issues like energy prices and infrastructure.</p>

The selection process will continue with another round of interviews, and a final nominee may be appointed to a Fed governor seat before being elevated to chair.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation, a move designed to prevent "bracket creep." This annual adjustment means Americans will be able to earn more before being pushed into a higher tax bracket. For 2026, the standard deduction will increase to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. The changes are part of the regular updates made by the agency to reflect economic shifts and ensure the tax code remains equitable over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as the player-head coach for Barnet FC, a team at the bottom of the Football League, from 2012. Despite his fame, Davids joined the struggling club without a salary, aiming to gain coaching experience while still playing. His tenure was marked by contrasts: he brought a top-tier mentality to training but also created friction, insisted on being called 'Mister,' wore the number one shirt, and sometimes skipped away games. Though the team was ultimately relegated, his time there remains a fascinating chapter in the club's history.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly grown into one of the world's largest clothing retailers, with its apparel sales increasing by nearly 40% from 2019 to 2024, reaching an estimated $9.7 billion. This revenue surpasses that of established apparel brands like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its own Kirkland Signature private label. A key part of its strategy is the "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where opportunistic purchases of brand-name overstocks create excitement and draw in customers.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in Bitcoin's value has created an additional 70,000 crypto millionaires in the past year, bringing the total to over 240,000 individuals. According to new research, these investors tend to spend more of their wealth gains compared to those with traditional stock or real estate assets. For every dollar of added crypto wealth, investors spend approximately 9.7 cents, primarily on restaurants, entertainment, and general merchandise rather than just luxury items. This increased spending contributed an estimated $145 billion to the U.S. economy in 2024, highlighting the growing economic impact of digital asset wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A writer recounts her experience filming an episode of "House Hunters Renovation," revealing the stark contrast between her polished on-screen life and her off-screen reality.

The immense pressure of the renovation, filming, and the emotional turmoil of the foster care system pushed their marriage to the brink of collapse.
