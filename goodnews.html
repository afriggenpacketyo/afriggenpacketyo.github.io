          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to climb. Despite the positive results, the company noted that overall consumer demand for its beverages remains soft but is showing signs of improvement. Unit case volume saw a slight 1% increase, reversing the previous quarter's decline, though key markets like North America and Latin America remained flat. The company is targeting budget-conscious consumers with smaller, more affordable options while seeing growth in its premium brands like Fairlife and Smartwater. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is reviewing strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This development sent the company's shares up by 10% and expands upon its earlier plan to split into two separate entities by mid-2026. Sources indicate that potential suitors include Netflix and Comcast, and that WBD had previously rejected several offers from Paramount Skydance. The move comes as the media giant continues to grapple with over $40 billion in debt from its 2022 merger.</p>

          <p>Dr. Lori Alfonse, a surgical oncologist at Lehigh Valley Topper Cancer Institute, is honoring Breast Cancer Awareness Month by wearing a different pair of pink shoes for each of the 31 days in October. With a collection of over 70 pairs, she uses her unique footwear to connect with her patients and send a message of strength and survival. Dr. Alfonse emphasizes that each shoe's unique personality reflects the individuality of her patients and their cancers. The gesture also serves as a reminder about the importance of mammograms for early detection, a cause close to her heart as her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother all had the disease.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat have skyrocketed, surging 47% on Tuesday alone and more than 127% since Monday. The dramatic rally was triggered after Roundhill Investments added the struggling company to its Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze against investors betting against the stock. The surge marks a significant turnaround for the former penny stock, which had been underperforming for years. This revival, alongside a new distribution deal with Walmart, has brought renewed attention to the company, though some see it as a potential sign of market froth. (not investment advice)</p>
