          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan in Shanghai, according to People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, to enhance the renminbi's global reach. This initiative is part of eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum, aimed at promoting Shanghai as a global financial hub. These measures come amid increasing tensions with the United States over trade and technology, accelerating China's efforts to expand the yuan's overseas adoption. The trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passport applications. The ruling allows individuals renewing passports, applying for new ones, or changing their name or sex designation to choose their identified gender, including selecting "X." This decision expands upon a previous ruling in April that only applied to a subset of plaintiffs. The executive order, issued by President Trump, had reversed a Biden administration policy that allowed self-selection of gender on passports, prompting a lawsuit from transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs. </p>

This high demand for talent highlights a deepening crunch in the industry, even acknowledged by industry leaders.

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures, as species shift habitats. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. The analysis suggests that many creatures may find new homes in the North Sea, which is expected to become a biodiversity hotspot within the next 50 years. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. </p>
