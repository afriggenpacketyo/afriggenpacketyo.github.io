          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This marks the first large-scale attempt to provide restitution for the atrocity, which decimated the city's Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. The plan involves raising private funds to support housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives for the descendants of the victims.

The Bruins fought hard, with home runs from Alexis Ramirez and Sofia Mujica earlier in the game, but were unable to capitalize on a bases-loaded opportunity in the ninth inning. The Volunteers advanced to the semifinal, while UCLA finished the season with a 55-13 record, leaving the team proud of their resilience and effort.</p>

          <p>A surprising number of Hollywood stars hail from Australia, a country with a smaller population than Texas, which raises the question of how this island nation produces so much acting talent. The success is attributed to institutions like NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, which provides rigorous training and instills a "can do" attitude. Additionally, Australian soap operas offer valuable experience, and a grounded, non-diva mindset helps actors navigate the industry. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the constant scrutiny of Hollywood, fostering a unique blend of skill, confidence, and humility.</p>

          <p>Robots are increasingly being used in sculpture, transforming the art world and sparking debate among artists. Companies like Robotor use robots to carve with precision and speed, allowing artists to realize complex designs more efficiently.

The aurora could appear as far south as northern California and Alabama, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm is caused by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. While the ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event, offering a rare opportunity to witness the aurora in regions where it is not typically seen.</p>

          <p>Potential candidates for California governor in 2026 are actively campaigning at the state Democratic Party's annual convention in Anaheim, seeking to gain support from party loyalists. With Kamala Harris's decision on whether to run still pending, the field remains uncertain, and candidates are focusing on key issues such as housing affordability and the cost of living. The candidates emphasized their qualifications and personal stories, hoping to resonate with delegates and position themselves as viable contenders in the upcoming election, while some took the opportunity to criticize Harris for her absence from the event.</p>
