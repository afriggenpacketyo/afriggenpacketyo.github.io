          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, supporting the Japanese company's $14 billion investment into the American producer. Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump stated that U.S. Steel would remain controlled by the USA, emphasizing the importance of national security. He also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, aiming to revitalize the American steel industry. Nippon Steel's investment is considered the largest of its kind in Pennsylvania's history, ensuring the preservation of U.S. Steel workers' jobs and facilities, as Trump still needs to approve the final deal.</p>

          <p>British officials are moving forward with trade talks with the US, aiming for deals on cars, metals, and aeroplane parts, even after a court decision overturned many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Despite the ruling, the UK is proceeding as if it did not apply, anticipating a potential reversal by the Supreme Court. The UK team met with US counterparts to finalize the details of the agreement, including parliamentary approval timelines. While some British companies are being forced to reduce prices due to American customer demands, others are ceasing exports altogether.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but their travel styles have shifted. The large group tours and shopping sprees are giving way to immersive experiences focused on Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, often repeat visitors, now favor family trips over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market, including opening a social media account on a popular Chinese platform.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator reported progress in talks with U.S. Cabinet members toward a potential tariff deal, possibly by June. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic revitalization, stated that Japan seeks the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports. The discussions included boosting investment and addressing economic security issues, with another round of negotiations planned before the G7 summit. Japan has proposed increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity in exchange for tariff elimination.</p>

Trump announced Nippon would invest $14 billion, including increasing steel production in Pittsburgh and modernizing mills across several states, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for U.S. Steel workers. He also revealed plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, but later admitted he hasn't seen the final details of the deal yet. The Biden administration previously blocked the sale over national security concerns, but Trump has since reversed that decision.</p>

Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while reducing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14bn would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal.

          <p>An appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, keeping a previous order halting the downsizing in place. The court ruled that the Executive Order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. This decision maintains a pause on Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts, as the administration sought to downsize the federal workforce. The ruling questions the legality of the administration's actions in attempting to pare the federal workforce.</p>
