          <p>Tim Friede, a self-taught snake expert, has been injecting himself with snake venom for nearly 18 years, effectively gaining immunity to several neurotoxins. Immunologist Jacob Glanville collaborated with Friede to study his blood, leading to the development of an antivenom that can protect against bites from 19 species of venomous snake in mice. The antivenom consists of two antibodies isolated from Friede's blood and a venom-blocking drug, potentially offering a more effective and safer treatment than traditional methods. The research highlights the potential for human-derived antibodies to revolutionize snakebite treatment and save lives.</p>
