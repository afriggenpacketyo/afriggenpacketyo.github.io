          <p>Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, after decades of efforts to recover his remains. The 2,500 items include documents, photographs, and handwritten letters, retrieved in collaboration with an allied foreign government. Cohen's intelligence work in Syria in the early 1960s provided crucial information that helped Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and seize the Golan Heights. The announcement comes amid efforts to improve Syrian-Israeli relations, with the recovery seen as a unifying moment in Israel.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture projects. This initiative seeks to leverage the high CO2 absorption capacity of marine vegetation to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a titan of Russian ballet and one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, has died at the age of 98. He served as artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, where he revitalized male dance and redefined Soviet ballet with productions like "The Stone Flower" and "Romeo and Juliet". Grigorovich's departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first dancers' strike in the theater's 200-year history. His work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally, as investors bet on the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. This move coincides with global expansions from leading Chinese EV makers and increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU regarding trade practices.</p>
