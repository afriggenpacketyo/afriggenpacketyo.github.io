          <p>China's Communist Party has paid tribute to the late Premier Li Keqiang on what would have been his 70th birthday, a customary practice for senior officials. An article from the Institute of Party History and Literature lauded Li as an "outstanding member of the party" and "exemplary leader" who dedicated his life to the state. Li passed away from a heart attack in October 2023, just months after stepping down from his role as premier. The official remembrance described his death as a "huge loss" for both the party and the nation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, a lack of cooling vegetation, and heat trapped by tall buildings and pollution. Temperatures in these zones can be up to 15 degrees Celsius higher, especially after sunset, posing health risks to residents. Solutions include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements to enhance water evaporation and cooling.</p>

          <p>As boating accidents increase, safety experts are urging caution for the July Fourth holiday, highlighting operator inexperience as a leading cause of incidents. Capt. Geoff Fahringer, a boating safety expert, emphasizes the importance of training, wearing life jackets, and avoiding overloading vessels. According to 2023 Coast Guard data, 75% of fatal boating accident victims drowned, and 88% of those were not wearing a life jacket. Fahringer recommends using a pre-departure checklist, carrying a VHF radio for emergencies, and receiving basic first aid training to ensure a safe time on the water.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has shed light on the ancient origins of the Uralic peoples, whose languages, like Finnish and Hungarian, are distinct from the Indo-European family. By combining genetic data from ancient individuals with archeological evidence, researchers traced a migration from Siberia across Eurasia between 11,000 and 4,000 years ago. This migration spread the Uralic language and culture, with genetic markers still present in the approximately 25 million Uralic speakers today. The research supports the theory that the eastern Ural Mountains are the ancestral homeland and details how these groups influenced other cultures with advancements like metallurgy.</p>

Despite his lack of recent game time, coach Andy Farrell‚Äîhis father‚Äîhad previously confirmed Owen was in contention for the squad due to his vast experience and leadership qualities from three prior Lions tours.</p>

          <p>Wall Street appeared to prioritize positive trade news over a concerning jobs report, with the S&P 500 reaching a new closing high. Markets reacted favorably to a new trade deal with Vietnam that sets a 20% tariff on its imports, a lower rate than previously feared, which benefits companies like Nike and Lululemon. This optimism overshadowed a report from ADP indicating that the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 100,000-job gain. The market's reaction suggests investors are currently more focused on factors that reduce corporate costs than on potential signs of economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Magna Roman Fort in Northumberland have been puzzled by the discovery of unusually large shoes dating back nearly 2,000 years. Of the 32 shoes unearthed, eight were equivalent to a modern UK size 13 or 14, a size rarely found at similar Roman sites like the nearby Vindolanda settlement. Researchers are exploring theories as to why the inhabitants of this particular fort had such large feet, questioning if they hailed from a specific region. The leather shoes were well-preserved in the low-oxygen soil of a defensive ditch, and further analysis of pottery found nearby will help date them more precisely.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export restrictions on chip-design software to China, according to announcements from semiconductor software companies Synopsys and Cadence. The firms, which dominate the electronic design automation (EDA) market, are now working to restore access to their products for Chinese customers. These restrictions were reportedly put in place in May, requiring companies to obtain licenses before exporting certain technology to China. The reversal comes as the U.S. and China have signaled progress on a trade truce, including conditional agreements to resume some technology and rare earth exchanges.</p>

          <h2>Essayist Celebrates the Global Evolution of the Spanish Language</h2>

          <p>This opinion essay celebrates the dynamic evolution of the Spanish language, which is spoken by 600 million people worldwide and is constantly being enriched by its diverse speakers. The author contrasts the Spanish-speaking world's general acceptance of regional variations with the more rigid debates sometimes seen among English speakers. While acknowledging that snobbery based on accents still exists, the essay argues that the blending of cultures, particularly in the U.S. and through migration to Spain, has made the language more varied and expressive. The author concludes that this collective, global use is what keeps languages like Spanish and English alive and thriving.</p>

          <h2>Clayton Kershaw Reaches 3,000 Career Strikeouts in Dodgers' Walk-Off Win</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw became the 20th pitcher in MLB history to record 3,000 career strikeouts during a game against the Chicago White Sox. The milestone was achieved in the sixth inning with a called strike against Vinny Capra, prompting a celebration from his teammates and the crowd. Despite Kershaw giving up four runs, the Dodgers staged a three-run rally in the ninth inning, capped by a walk-off RBI single from Freddie Freeman for a 5-4 victory. The historic night for Kershaw was slightly marred by an injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who left the game with a knee sprain.</p>
