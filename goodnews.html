        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Serbia, a student-led movement is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic government through persistent protests and demonstrations. The movement was sparked by a tragic train station collapse in Novi Sad, which protesters believe was caused by corruption, and has since grown into a widespread expression of discontent. The article highlights a moment of solidarity when Muslim students from Novi Pazar relieved protesting students from Belgrade during Easter, and a war veteran's inclusive message resonated deeply. Despite government attempts to quell the protests, including offering loans to young people, the movement continues to gain momentum, advocating for early elections and setting an example of unity and horizontal decision-making.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a long-standing dispute. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to temple representatives in South Korea following a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of the temple's ownership. The artifact is now expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple. The statue's return marks the end of a legal battle that began when a South Korean temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. Prime Minister Starmer is quoted saying new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK, a move analyzed as an attempt to regain control of the narrative from Reform UK. The proposals also include prioritizing residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. The article also highlights criticisms from Conservatives who deem the plans insufficient and notes that Starmer plans to shut an ECHR migrant loophole.</p>
