          <p>The Commerce Department reported that the inflation rate slipped to 2.1% in April, lower than expected, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation gauge. The monthly increase was 0.1%, while core readings excluding food and energy also showed slight decreases, with consumer spending slowing to a 0.2% increase. Simultaneously, personal income surged by 0.8%, leading to a rise in the personal savings rate to 4.9%, the highest level in nearly a year, reflecting a more cautious consumer mood. Markets showed little immediate reaction to the news, with stock futures continuing to point lower and longer-duration Treasury yields higher. (not investment advice)</p>

Ryanair stated that the share price aspect of the bonus is "on only one of two conditions", the second being that Michael and the rest of the management team must remain employed by Ryanair until the end of July 2028, so these share options won't vest for another three years yet. O'Leary has been with Ryanair since 1988 and has spearheaded the airline's growth into Europe's largest low-cost carrier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has fired a tenured professor, Francesca Gino, for the first time in 80 years, following accusations of data falsification in multiple published papers. The case involved clear manipulation of study data to support her hypotheses, focusing on honesty in business. The university's decision to strip Gino of tenure signals a commitment to addressing scientific fraud, a problem chillingly common across academia. While the case highlights the need for improved fraud detection and punishment, Harvard's handling of the situation is seen as unusually good.</p>

          <p>Erica Benner, a political philosopher, argues that Machiavelli's famous work, The Prince, is not a manual for tyrants but a veiled critique of authoritarian power. She suggests Machiavelli is a philosopher for our times, writing about the dangers of inequality, partisanship, and the importance of appearance over truth. In Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli espouses a deep belief in republicanism. Benner believes Machiavelli's work is often misunderstood, with superficial readers missing the deeper criticisms and republican ideals within his writings.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. will become the first major automaker to offer racing karts, aiming to inspire a new generation of auto enthusiasts. The company plans to sell karts for about a quarter of the current market price to make them affordable for families with children interested in motor sports. Toyota hopes to spark greater interest in automotive careers by giving children easier access to motor sports, aiming to inspire future drivers, engineers, and mechanics. Pricing and launch details have yet to be released.</p>
