        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in Intel, making it the company's largest single shareholder in a rare move of direct federal involvement in a private company. This decision, converting previous grants under the CHIPS Act into equity, is aimed at bolstering domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC and to compete with China, particularly in the AI sector. While the move is intended to enhance national security and stabilize the supply chain, it raises concerns about potential government influence over corporate decisions and the risks of market intervention.

          <p>A recent gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes major Asian powers like China, Russia, and India, has underscored the growing need for a new global economic and monetary system. The article argues that political declarations of cooperation must be supported by new multilateral institutions, similar to the Bretton Woods agreement that shaped the post-WWII order. Without such a framework, the world risks further fragmentation into competing economic blocs. The expanding SCO, now with 27 members and partners, is positioned to play a significant role in initiating this complex but necessary global restructuring.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, making him the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status highlights the ongoing debate surrounding Japan's male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a potential succession crisis that reflects the nation's broader demographic challenges. The ceremony has renewed calls to reconsider the rules, with significant public support for allowing female members, like Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political attacks from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has criticized the movement's 'globalist' ideals, echoing the 'degenerate art' rhetoric used by the Nazis who shut the school down in 1933. Despite the pressure, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its program, focusing on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design, while forming alliances to counter the rising threat of far-right cultural influence.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed the legendary 'scorpion kick' during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. The audacious and acrobatic save, where he cleared the ball by kicking it over his own back with his heels, cemented his legacy as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring ability, and a career marked by both brilliance and controversy. The scorpion kick remains an unforgettable moment that perfectly captured his unique and entertaining approach to the game.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and other humanitarian protections for over one million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling criticizes Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision as 'arbitrary and capricious,' stating it would force people to return to dangerously unstable home countries. This injunction provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands who faced the imminent loss of their legal right to live and work in the U.S. The decision marks a significant, though likely temporary, victory for immigrant advocates in a contentious legal battle.</p>
