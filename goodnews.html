          <p>A UK-EU summit is anticipated to pave the way for an agreement that could significantly reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border, with the UK seeking to reset its post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The summit is expected to yield an "agreement to agree" on trade issues, particularly concerning food and agricultural products, potentially leading to the removal of most physical checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. While this deal would not eliminate the sea border entirely, it could alleviate some of the challenges faced by businesses in Northern Ireland. The agreement could mean the end of 'Not for EU' labelling and the removal of most physical checks on goods.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents, have seen a shift in public perception, potentially impacting their chances of parole. Initially portrayed as greedy killers, growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse has led to increased sympathy for their claims of abuse. New evidence and media portrayals have contributed to this shift, with figures like Kim Kardashian advocating for their freedom. A judge has reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, with the final decision resting on California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who will weigh public opinion against his own political ambitions.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, fueled by dry soil and strong winds, created dramatic scenes in Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. Such dust storms are uncommon in this area, with the last significant event occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. Meteorologists attributed the storm to thunderstorms that generated high winds, lifting dust from parched farmland and creating a phenomenon known as a haboob.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down late Saturday, capping four decades of operation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy, though whether that goal can be achieved remains uncertain. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ended operations as the self-ruled island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster. It is unclear what the next steps will be in regards to replacing the power generated from the reactor.</p>

Discussions focus on a joint declaration addressing geopolitical issues, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While the UK seeks closer economic ties, the Labour government faces constraints due to Eurosceptic sentiments and red lines against rejoining the EU's customs union or single market. Key points of contention include fishing rights, access to EU defense contracts, and a youth mobility scheme, with both sides navigating complex political and economic considerations.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have increasingly challenged the Trump administration's deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. In multiple cases, courts have insisted that immigrants be given the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration has sought to expedite removals. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, underscoring the fundamental principle of due process. Legal scholars have praised the courts' defense of constitutional rights, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place.</p>

          <h2>Youth Mobility Scheme Could Be Part of EU Deal, Starmer Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 17:50:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to move abroad for up to two years. Starmer insisted the scheme would be "reciprocal" and would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. While specific details remain unclear, the proposal has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as "free movement through the back door," though Starmer denies the accusations.</p>
