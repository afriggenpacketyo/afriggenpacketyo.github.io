          <p>Sources report that the Trump administration is considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, dubbed a "flying palace," as a gift from the Qatari royal family, intended for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, at which point ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses are being drafted to ensure the arrangement complies with bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause, concluding that the gift is permissible because it is not conditioned on any official act. The aircraft, valued at approximately $400 million, would undergo modifications by the U.S. Air Force to meet presidential transport standards. The current Air Force One fleet faces delays and cost overruns, prompting Trump to seek alternative solutions. Optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has voiced reservations about using a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns over the potential strain on state finances. This statement comes as his administration explores economic strategies in anticipation of the House of Councillors election this summer. Senior government officials have generally dismissed the consumption tax cut idea, as they are at 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items. Meanwhile, other news includes Trump reporting trade progress with China, a South Korean ex-minister running for president, the selection of Pope Leo XIV, arrests for an illegal poker den in Tokyo, expressway redevelopment in Tokyo, and the slow adoption of app-based salary payments in Japan.

          <p>A plan to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in a historic Fort Lauderdale beachfront area has ignited community outrage, with some residents alleging racial motives. The basketball courts, popular among a diverse group for generations, were built shortly after segregation ended on the city's beaches. Residents fear the conversion will destroy a long-standing community tradition and accuse city commissioners of seeking to "whiten" the beach. While developers claim pickleball's broader appeal motivated the decision, community members insist they were not informed the basketball courts would be removed. The mayor has expressed interest in finding a solution that preserves basketball access. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>After a century of progress, U.S. life expectancy has recently declined, but scientific advancements offer hope for reversing this trend. Cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol suggests evidence-based strategies for longer, healthier lives, including knowing and lowering biological age through proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores. Adopting a Mediterranean diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and seafood, while reducing processed foods and red meat, is also crucial. Prioritizing deep sleep and incorporating strength training exercises can further combat aging, as can maintaining social connections to avoid isolation and loneliness. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, a psychiatrist encourages mothers to be imperfect and cut themselves some slack, arguing that being flawed is a crucial part of a mother's job. The author criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, highlighting the importance of recognizing the value and sacrifices that mothers make. The author notes that a child's caregivers are the template for their future relationships, and relationships are not one-way. She also offers a lighthearted quiz to help mothers acknowledge their imperfections and embrace their good-enough status. Optimism score is 90.</p>
