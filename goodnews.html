          <h2>China Unveils 'Meteor-1' Optical Computing Chip Amid US Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in using light for computation. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development addresses the limitations of traditional electronic chips and offers potential hardware acceleration for AI and data centers. This is especially important as US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices decreased to $66.57 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50, reaching levels below those before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off indicates investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a 'peace through strength' strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of any loss of life.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 23:42:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, despite being the world's top producer, with Myanmar accounting for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are less abundant and more valuable. This reliance has strengthened China's dominance in the global heavy rare earths supply chain, but the ongoing civil war in Myanmar poses supply chain risks, as armed groups have seized key mining sites, leading to disruptions and price spikes. The extraction methods used in Myanmar also come with high environmental costs, raising concerns about sustainability.</p>

Germany will be able to borrow a total of ‚Ç¨378.1 billion for defense between 2025 and 2029, facilitated by debt brake reform from March.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took a gamble by inserting the US into the conflict between Israel and Iran, but it may have paid off with a possible ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that he said could lead to a lasting peace. The development comes after a tumultuous day in the region, when Iran followed through on its promise to retaliate for Saturday's US strike. According to early reports, all the Iranian missiles directed at the massive US base in Qatar were intercepted and there were no American casualties or damage.</p>
