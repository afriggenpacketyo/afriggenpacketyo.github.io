          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, prompted by the Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies in the original investigation, including blood evidence in the couple's bedroom. Some spots believed to be blood were not, and others were never tested, casting doubt on the prosecution's case. Despite this, the District Attorney's Office initially sought to retry her before ultimately dropping the charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered that the spleen may play a significant role in fighting diabetes through cell transplantation. Research indicates that transplanting islet cells into the spleen, with proper shielding, could improve their survival and effectiveness in treating type 1 diabetes. The spleen is being explored as a more promising long-term survival site compared to the liver. These findings could potentially transform the spleen into a hub for diabetes treatment, especially given the high number of diabetes cases in China and worldwide.</p>
