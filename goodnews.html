          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 17:55:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs imposed by President Trump on British cars and metals, providing relief to key UK industries. The US will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars annually and slash tariffs on steel and aluminum. In return, the UK will provide "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers. While leaders from both countries hailed the deal as significant, some analysts believe it does not meaningfully alter pre-existing trade terms and Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which he claims will provide billions of dollars in increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture. The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers as part of the agreement. Britain states the deal will cut tariffs on UK cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, with a quota of 100,000 UK vehicles that can be imported to the US at a 10% tariff.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses how President Trump's focus on individual federal judges, rather than on law and precedent, is a step away from a government of laws and toward one of men and women. By attacking judges who rule against his policies, Trump delegitimizes the court system and risks physical harm against judges. While acknowledging that judges are not purely objective, the article argues that the focus on judges' personalities serves Trump's purpose of demonizing them and avoiding discussion of the law.</p>

          <p>A football fan is suing the NFL for $100 million, claiming "severe emotional distress and trauma" after Shedeur Sanders was drafted in the fifth round of the NFL draft, a much lower position than predicted. The lawsuit alleges the NFL violated the Sherman Antitrust Act for collusion and possibly the Civil Rights Act for race discrimination, as well as consumer protection laws. The plaintiff, a Colorado football fan, claims slanderous statements about Sanders harmed his reputation and caused emotional distress. Legal experts dismiss the lawsuit, citing lack of standing and difficulty in proving race discrimination or quantifying emotional harm.</p>
