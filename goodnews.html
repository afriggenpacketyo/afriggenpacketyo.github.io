        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by stronger-than-anticipated revenue from its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's earnings fell to $14.9 billion, or $5.24 a share, but this figure still beat estimates after accounting for a prior-year gain. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results while also reiterating warnings about risks from U.S. trade policy and geopolitical tensions. The bank's trading operations benefited from market volatility, and it raised its full-year guidance for net interest income, a key indicator of profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This week is significant for the cryptocurrency industry in Washington D.C., as the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on two major regulatory bills. The GENUIS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law, marking a major victory for the industry. However, the more comprehensive CLARITY Act, which defines the regulatory jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC, faces a more uncertain path in the Senate due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto holdings. Crypto firms are heavily lobbying for the bills' passage, arguing that regulatory clarity will foster greater investment and consumer trust. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Experts Advise Homebuyers on Preparations for Potential Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 10:30:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts anticipated later this year, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers to prepare now to capitalize on lower borrowing costs. They recommend that buyers research the mortgage process, improve their credit scores by paying down debt, and explore different loan features beyond just the interest rate. Experts emphasize that finding the right home is more important than trying to perfectly time the market, as increased competition following rate cuts could drive up housing prices. Taking these preparatory steps can place buyers in a stronger position to act quickly when a favorable opportunity arises in the housing market.</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets, a critical component in products like iPhones, from a U.S. facility. The deal, which caused MP Materials' stock to surge 23%, aims to strengthen Apple's domestic supply chain and reduce reliance on China, the dominant global supplier. As part of the partnership, the companies will also collaborate on a new rare earth recycling facility in California. This investment aligns with broader U.S. efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing of essential technological materials, supported by recent investments from the Department of Defense in MP Materials.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed the largest-ever merger of two black holes, resulting in the formation of a new, massive black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery, made by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration using gravitational wave detection, challenges existing models of black hole formation. The two progenitor black holes were unusually large and spinning near the maximum speed allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity, making the event's signal complex to interpret. This groundbreaking observation, designated GW231123, is pushing the boundaries of astrophysical understanding and is expected to open new avenues for research into the universe's most extreme phenomena.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average rates for CDs are modest, top online banks are offering significantly higher annual percentage yields, particularly for short-term CDs of six months to one year. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, makes shorter-term commitments more lucrative than longer ones at present. To secure the best rates, experts advise savers to compare offers from various online banks, which typically have lower overhead and can provide more competitive returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed income from Social Security, managing debt can be a significant challenge, but there are effective strategies available. Federal law generally protects Social Security benefits from being garnished for most consumer debts, such as credit cards and medical bills. Experts advise creating a strict budget to free up funds for debt repayment and prioritizing essential payments like housing and utilities. Contacting creditors to ask for hardship programs, which may lower interest rates or payments, is a crucial step. For those with overwhelming debt, reputable credit counseling agencies can provide structured debt management plans to regain financial stability.</p>
