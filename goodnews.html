          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock climb over 5% following the announcement of a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The company intends to use the capital for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment, continuing a trend of significant debt financing to fuel its rapid expansion. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and plans for a $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, CoreWeave, a key partner for Nvidia and Microsoft, maintains it is meeting strong client demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 14:32:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have strict borrowing caps. This article outlines the annual and lifetime limits for federal student loans, which vary based on dependency status and academic level, often leaving a significant funding gap. For dependent undergraduates, the lifetime limit is $31,000, while graduate students can borrow up to $138,500, including undergraduate loans. When federal aid is insufficient, private student loans are presented as a viable, albeit more complex, option to cover remaining costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Domino's Pizza Aims to Capture Market Share by Appealing to Value-Conscious Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 14:26:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share amid economic pressures on consumers, according to CEO Russell Weiner. The company reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales for the second quarter, exceeding estimates, driven by new products and value-focused promotions. Unlike many competitors seeing a pullback from low-income customers, Domino's saw sales growth across all income cohorts. Weiner believes the industry's challenges are a tailwind for Domino's, as consumers prioritize value and are drawn to its targeted deals over those of its rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR story shares the experience of Alek Hermon, whose father was in a coma following a traumatic brain injury. After making the difficult decision to remove his father from life support, Hermon felt numb and alone in the hospital hallway. At that moment, a nurse named Ray, who had cared for his father and shared a love for science fiction, ran to him. Ray, who had been an assistant in the operating room, embraced Hermon in a tearful hug, providing profound comfort in a moment of overwhelming grief and isolation.</p>

          <p>Joseph Lee's debut book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the rich indigenous history of Martha's Vineyard, known to his Aquinnah Wampanoag people as Noepe. The book moves beyond the island's modern image as an affluent tourist destination to explore the challenges of preserving indigenous identity and community. Lee discusses the complexities of living in a place that is both a sacred ancestral home and a luxury playground, where high property taxes and tourism threaten to displace the very people whose history defines the land.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the Los Angeles Times highlights the surprising efficiency of the U.S. State Department's new online passport renewal service. The author recounts receiving a new passport in just 14 days, a stark contrast to the lengthy waits typically associated with government bureaucracy. The article credits the program as a major customer service success for the Biden administration, transforming an outdated process to handle a surge of up to 25 million applications a year. Despite its success, the piece notes potential future challenges, including understaffing at the passport bureau.</p>

The 10-track LP, which features a funky, club-oriented sound, dropped early Monday morning with no guest appearances listed. In a social media post, Tyler explained the album was inspired by people's fear of being filmed while dancing and was made for movement. The release follows his successful "Chromakopia" album and a subsequent world tour, continuing his prolific creative output.</p>

          <p>The process for launching an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is defined by complex, redundant safety protocols rather than a simple red button. Inside underground bunkers, missileers must first decrypt and verify launch orders. The launch itself requires the coordinated action of at least two separate crews, with each of the four officers turning keys and levers simultaneously. This system of multiple checks and balances is designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch or blocking a legitimate one.</p>

          <p>A new class of weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, may be a game-changer for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This common hormonal disorder is linked to metabolic issues, and women in early trials have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain after taking the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps rebalance hormones, though larger studies are needed. High costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named former biotech executive and Stanford professor Dr. George Tidmarsh as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This crucial division oversees the approval of most new drugs. The appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background may reassure the pharmaceutical sector, and his past writings suggest he could take a more stringent approach to drug regulation, including the controversial accelerated approval pathway.</p>
