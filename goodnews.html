        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, fell short of a majority in the parliament vote to become chancellor, securing only 310 of the required 316 votes in the Bundestag. This defeat is considered unprecedented in modern German history and a significant blow to Merz, occurring two and a half months after winning Germany's federal elections. The Bundestag has 14 days to choose Merz or another candidate, with potential for multiple votes. The far-right party Alternative for Germany called for fresh elections following Merz's failure, while his colleague Johann Wadephul expressed confidence in a second attempt. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the Trump administration's offer of $1,000 to illegal immigrants who self-deport, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) suggested a system of fines and work visas. Gallego proposed that immigrants pay a $5,000 fine, undergo a background check, and receive a renewable work visa for a few years. The $1,000 offer from the Trump administration is part of a crackdown on illegal immigration, with the Department of Homeland Security claiming it will decrease deportation costs by around 70 percent. Gallego noted that immigrants would pay for the cost of their background check, similar to the current process for other immigrants.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above policymakers' target, prices for some consumer goods and services are declining. The article notes price decreases in airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline, attributing these shifts to factors like seasonal supply, lower transportation costs, and technological advancements. Economists caution that these price declines may be temporary due to potential tariff increases and volatile market conditions. Consumers are advised to take advantage of the lower prices while they last, as they are expected to rise again in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly experiencing "tip-creep," with gratuities now requested in unexpected places like self-checkouts and bookstores, leading to a growing backlash. While tipping has long been customary for service workers, its expansion has sparked resentment and a sense of guilt among consumers. Some are reducing their tips in hopes of forcing employers to raise wages, while others are avoiding tipping at establishments with regular minimum wage laws. Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has drawn criticism, with opponents arguing it would incentivize low wages and further expand tipping culture.</p>

          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is attributed to economic shifts over the past half-century, rather than solely culture war issues. Declining manufacturing jobs and increasing economic inequality have disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Traditional gender roles made consumerism less appealing to men, while feminist messages empowered women in business and employment. Redefining men's roles in caretaking and production is crucial, as manufacturing is unlikely to make a comeback.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses the shift in feminism from the 1990s to the early 2000s, focusing on the rise of postfeminism and the co-opting of "Girl Power" by commercial interests. The author, Sophie Gilbert, argues that this shift, influenced by the AIDS crisis and the rise of porn, led to a focus on sexual power as the primary form of empowerment for women. Gilbert critiques the individualistic outlook of 21st-century feminism and calls for a return to collective action and a focus on issues that benefit all women. The article touches on the influence of social media, the complicity of women in upholding sexist culture, and the need for better media education.</p>
