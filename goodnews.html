While standing on the edge of the sideline in street clothes, Lamb was struck from behind by an official who was tracking a play downfield. Although Lamb was uninjured and laughed off the incident, the Cowboys received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams' preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys showcased the potential of their running back corps, particularly rookie Blake Corum. With the team looking to manage the workload of star rusher Kyren Williams, Corum made a strong case for a larger role by scoring two touchdowns and gaining 32 yards. Other running backs, including Jarquez Hunter and Cody Schrader, also performed well, while quarterback Stetson Bennett showed confidence in his extended playing time. The game provided a positive outlook on the Rams' offensive depth heading into the regular season.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 22:14:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'quiet luxury' trend of understated, logo-free fashion is giving way to a resurgence of 'loud luxury,' characterized by bold branding and distinctive designs. As the luxury sector faces slowing sales after a post-pandemic boom, major fashion houses like Gucci and Burberry are shifting their creative direction to inject novelty and reignite consumer desire. Analysts suggest this cyclical change is a strategy to appeal to weary shoppers and regain market relevance, especially for brands that struggled while ultra-luxe, subtle labels thrived. This shift could signal a turning point for the industry, moving away from discrete opulence.</p>

She served as the first-base umpire for the game between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, receiving a warm ovation from the crowd. After the game, Pawol donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the historic occasion. Her debut is the culmination of years of work in the minor leagues, and she is scheduled to umpire behind home plate later in the series.</p>

          <p>The booming market for 'functional beverages' that promise stress relief and relaxation is facing scrutiny from health experts. While consumers like the taste and the ritual of consuming these drinks, dietitians are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements they contain, such as Lion's Mane or L-theanine, have a significant physiological effect. One brand, Trip, recently had an advertisement banned for making unproven health claims. A psychologist suggests that the calming effect users feel may be more psychological, stemming from the act of setting aside a moment for a personal treat rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran's recent description of himself as 'culturally Irish' has ignited a debate about identity, heritage, and what it means to be Irish in the modern era. While some criticized the English-born star, others, particularly those of Irish descent in the UK, defended his right to feel a connection to his heritage. The article explores the complex, evolving nature of Irish identity, which encompasses a wide spectrum of political, religious, and cultural experiences. It suggests that identity is increasingly seen as personal and multifaceted, rather than being defined by rigid, singular labels.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of 'War of the Worlds' starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a near-0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and sparking a conversation about why audiences are often drawn to terrible movies. The article suggests that universally disliked films can be more intriguing and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. For many viewers, there is a charm in watching an earnestly made but flawed film, leading to a 'so bad it's good' cult following. This phenomenon explains why a movie's terrible reputation can sometimes generate more curiosity and viewership than positive reviews.</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the tech landscape, despite no longer dominating headlines. Its initial success challenged the 'bigger is better' philosophy in AI development, proving that capable models could be built with fewer resources, which jolted Silicon Valley. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, some US startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs. The app's arrival also intensified the US-China AI rivalry, serving as a 'Sputnik moment' that spurred American investment and policy focus on maintaining dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have expressed regret after a collaborative shoe design sparked accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The government complained that the 'Oaxaca Slip-On' sandal was a reinterpretation of the traditional huarache sandals unique to the region, without partnership or compensation for the Indigenous community. Following the controversy, Chavarria apologized, and Adidas stated it is seeking to meet with local officials to 'repair the damage.' The incident is the latest in a series of disputes between Mexico and global fashion brands over the use of Indigenous designs.</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Donald Trump, in turn, suggested that Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips. This development eased investor fears about the potential negative impact of tariffs on Apple's profitability, contributing to the significant stock rally. (not investment advice)</p>
