        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoshihiko Noda, the head of Japan's main opposition party, has decided against submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, making same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. Noda cited concerns about creating a political vacuum amid rising tensions in the Middle East and worries over higher U.S. tariffs. Ishiba had previously stated his readiness to dissolve the lower house for a snap election if such a motion were submitted, but Noda's decision avoids this scenario. Noda's party is the only one capable of submitting such a motion on its own, but would require support from other parties for it to pass. </p>

          <p>Lithuanian hunters have declined a government request to shoot a young female bear that wandered into Vilnius, the capital city, causing a stir among residents. The government issued the kill permit as a precaution, but hunters, aware of the small bear population in Lithuania, refused to comply, advocating for sedation and relocation instead. The bear, estimated to be around 2 years old, was described as scared but not aggressive, and was later spotted peacefully wandering through a forest outside the city. This event sparked a debate about wildlife management and conservation efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan is returning to long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) deals due to the growing demand from data centers supporting the artificial intelligence boom and rising costs of alternative energy sources. The country's new national energy plan also identifies gas as a key transition fuel for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This shift marks a change from previous years when Japan's LNG imports were declining due to nuclear power plant restarts and increased renewable energy use. The new energy plan encourages public-private cooperation to secure long-term LNG contracts, recognizing the importance of stable supply amidst price volatility and potential disruptions.
