          <p>A group of international food experts recently toured Higashikagawa and Miki to delve into the food culture of Kagawa Prefecture. The chefs participated in local traditions, including visits to a soy sauce brewery and a tea ceremony. The tour was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima. Participants praised the simple cooking methods and the rich flavor of the tea, comparing it to a cappuccino; additionally, the musical performance featured elegant sounds of wind instruments reverberating through the historic tea room. The mayor of Miki presented the guests with traditional hand towels featuring designs by a local artist.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' a highly parallel optical computing chip, potentially accelerating AI and data centers. The chip's theoretical computing power is comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs, offering a solution to the limitations of traditional electronic chips. This development comes as US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing offers advantages such as ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, positioning it as a critical direction for future technological advancements.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. Prices had initially surged following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but the lack of casualties led investors to believe the conflict would de-escalate. President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for preventative measures to be taken and no lives were lost. The market sell-off indicates a belief that Trump's actions have successfully de-escalated the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential for Donald Trump to act as a trusted broker of peace between Iran and Israel, following recent escalations and a proposed ceasefire. Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, framing it as a strategic success without American lives lost. However, questions remain about whether Tehran trusts Trump, given his past rhetoric about regime change, and whether Israel will scale back its military advantage. The article suggests that Trump's influence will be tested at an upcoming NATO summit, where a positive outcome in the Middle East could improve his standing.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers have overwhelmingly congratulated President Trump, highlighting his negotiating skills. Democrats, however, appear to be withholding their congratulations, with some expressing concerns about the legality and constitutionality of Trump's actions. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that Trump's admission of unilaterally bringing the United States into a war without congressional approval is a grave matter.

Hermer defended Starmer's decision to seek a "warm" relationship with President Trump, arguing that it has enabled the UK to strike economic deals. He emphasized that being a good faith player in international law is overwhelmingly in the national interests of the country.
