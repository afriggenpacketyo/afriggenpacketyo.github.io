          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Madrid to protest against the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, led by the conservative Popular Party (PP). Protesters accuse Sanchez's administration of corruption, citing several scandals, including one involving his wife. PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo demanded a snap election, accusing the government of "mafia practices," though the next vote is not due until 2027. Sanchez has dismissed the investigations as a right-wing "smear campaign," and a government spokeswoman mocked the turnout, noting a rock duo recently drew a larger crowd. </p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in relationships identifies the most common reasons couples fight, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist suggests that tone of voice often signals contempt, a strong predictor of divorce, and recommends naming the effect rather than striking back. Arguments about family relations often reflect fundamental misalignments and unmet needs, requiring reassurance and discussion of limits. The real issue behind chore-related arguments is the uneven distribution of labor, while communication style arguments can be addressed with a designated "time-out" signal.</p>

          <p>A Pomona College graduate reflects on current students' efforts to alter the impact of technology on campus life, including calls for more tech-free classes and the creation of a "Luddite Club." The author argues that the pervasiveness of technology poses a threat to small residential liberal-arts colleges, where close-knit communities and in-person learning are valued. They suggest that Pomona, with its resources and setting, is well-suited to experiment with scaling back technology, such as creating tech-free dorms and subsidizing tech-free classes. The goal is to differentiate Pomona as a place that values tech refuges alongside technological access.</p>
