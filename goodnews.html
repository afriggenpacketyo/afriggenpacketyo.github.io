          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on the science behind foul-smelling shoes and their impact on shoe rack design. Their research, initially aimed at designing better shoe racks for students, uncovered that bacterial growth (Kytococcus sedentarius) was the primary cause of odor. Experiments showed that a short blast of UVC light could effectively kill these microbes and eliminate the smell. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack, earning recognition from the quirky scientific award for making people "laugh, then think."</p>

          <p>Europe holds a commanding 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day's 12 singles matches at the Ryder Cup, needing just three points to secure victory. Captain Luke Donald is on the verge of becoming only the second European captain to win both home and away matches. No team has ever overcome a deficit larger than 10-6, making a US comeback statistically improbable. This lead marks Europe's largest ever before the singles matches, surpassing their 2004 Oakland Hills advantage. Despite Donald's cautious remarks, the team is well-positioned to claim their fifth away win.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in their $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit concerning his baseless claims of 2020 election rigging. Dominion had sued Giuliani in 2021 for spreading conspiracy theories that undermined public confidence in elections and led to threats against officials. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion reached with Fox News and Newsmax. The lawsuit is one of several legal and financial setbacks for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred and ordered to pay $148 million to defamed Georgia election workers.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an unprecedented 11½–4½ lead over the United States going into the Ryder Cup's final singles matches, needing only two and a half more points to retain the trophy. This historic advantage follows a day marred by "thuggish" and "moronic" insults from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to ejections. Despite the unsportsmanlike conduct, European players maintained their focus and delivered an imperious performance. The significant lead makes a US comeback highly improbable, with resale prices for Sunday tickets plummeting as fans leave early.</p>

          <h2>World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler Struggles at Ryder Cup, Highlighting Team Event Pressures</h2>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler endured a historic struggle at the Ryder Cup, becoming the first American to lose his first four sessions, embodying the US team's overall futility. Despite his dominant individual form this year, Scheffler's authority dissolved in the team format, where his usually magnificent ball-striking was undermined by fragile putting. The article suggests that his detached mindset, an asset in stroke play, may be a liability in the intense team crucible of the Ryder Cup. Scheffler's unexpected performance underscores how even top-ranked players can be overwhelmed by the unique pressures of the competition.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his new book "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the court's swing justice. Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse, fearing that partisanship is eroding reasoned conversation and even influencing Supreme Court opinions. He details his decisive votes on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the plight of children with gay parents, and abortion, where he separated personal morality from legal judgment. Kennedy also critiques originalism, advocating for a dynamic understanding of "liberty" that evolves over time.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Efficacy of Collagen Supplements for Reducing Signs of Skin Ageing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic. While some users report positive results like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells directly. Collagen is a large molecule that needs to be broken down into peptides to be absorbed, and even then, its targeted delivery to the skin is uncertain. Experts recommend marine collagen over vegan options and suggest that sunblock, a healthy diet, and stopping smoking offer far greater benefits for skin health than supplements.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain and protect jobs following a cyberattack that halted production for weeks. The cyberattack, claimed by "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," forced JLR to suspend manufacturing, impacting its 700 suppliers, many of whom are small businesses facing cash shortages. Business Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the loan's role in safeguarding jobs in the automotive sector, while JLR works "around the clock" to restart operations safely. The move, though welcomed, drew criticism for being slow to act, with calls for a cyber reinsurance scheme. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trojans played without key offensive linemen and their defensive leader, and their defense allowed over 500 yards.
