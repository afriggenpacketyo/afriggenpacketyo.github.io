          <p>Vice President JD Vance engaged in high-stakes diplomatic talks in the UK with European allies and Ukrainian officials. The meeting, which took place just a day after President Trump announced a summit with Vladimir Putin, reportedly made significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The upcoming Trump-Putin meeting has caused concern among European leaders, with Ukraine insisting that any peace negotiations must include their participation to be legitimate. The discussions occurred amidst ongoing tensions and Ukraine's rejection of potential territorial swaps suggested by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's recent atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki represents a potential test for improving China-Japan relations. Lee Yi-yang, who serves as Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, became the first Taiwanese official to attend these events, signaling Taiwan's effort to strengthen unofficial ties with Tokyo. While Beijing is expected to view this development unfavorably, observers suggest both China and Japan will likely act cautiously to avoid derailing their recent diplomatic progress. The move follows a rare visit to Japan by Taiwan's foreign minister.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian has filed a federal lawsuit against Ohio, seeking the right to sell its cars directly to consumers, a practice currently blocked by state franchise laws. The lawsuit argues that these laws harm consumers by reducing competition and choice. Rivian points out that competitor Tesla was granted a dealership license in 2013, before a 2014 law, heavily lobbied for by auto dealer associations, effectively prevented other automakers from following suit. This legal challenge represents the latest battle in an ongoing, state-by-state fight between new EV companies and traditional dealership models.</p>

Despite an initial struggle, Raducanu demonstrated strong defense and returning skills, capitalizing on her opponent's errors on a day with oppressive heat. The win continues her solid performance against lower-ranked players and sets her up for a challenging third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova. This performance signals growing consistency for the British player.</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has explained his team's decision to forgo popular joint practices during this year's training camp, a choice made by only three NFL teams. Taylor stated that he prefers focusing on the team's own development and installation of plays rather than preparing for a specific practice opponent. He believes intrasquad competition and utilizing starters like Joe Burrow in preseason games is a more effective way to prepare for the regular season. This approach allows for more flexibility and a crucial evaluation period for position battles, particularly on the offensive line.</p>

          <p>Despite an incredible unbeaten 86 from 50 balls by Jonny Bairstow, Welsh Fire fell short by eight runs against London Spirit in The Hundred. Chasing 164, Fire suffered a top-order collapse, leaving Bairstow with a monumental task. He and Chris Green mounted a stunning 100-run partnership, with Bairstow hitting a flurry of sixes to bring the game to a tense finish, but it was not enough. London Spirit's total was built on a solid 70 not out from opener David Warner, securing their first win and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless in the competition.</p>

          <p>Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has ended his time at Liverpool, completing a transfer to Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal for a reported fee of £46.3 million. Nunez, who joined Liverpool in 2022 for a significantly higher fee, had a mixed tenure at the club, scoring 40 goals but struggling for consistent starting opportunities. Known for his chaotic energy and memorable late-game winners, he ultimately failed to live up to the high expectations that accompanied his arrival. His departure is part of a broader squad rebuild under head coach Arne Slot ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the tense inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, a step taken by the new liberal government in Seoul to ease tensions. For months, the two nations engaged in a tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating sounds. This de-escalation comes as North Korea continues to reject diplomatic overtures and ahead of upcoming U.S.-South Korea military exercises.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, this summer has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia examined fragments of the space rock, which originated from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The meteorite's arrival was preceded by a bright fireball seen across Georgia and South Carolina. Scientists plan to officially name the rock the McDonough Meteorite, marking the 27th such recovery in the state's history.</p>
