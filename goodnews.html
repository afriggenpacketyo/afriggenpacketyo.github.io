          <p>The United States Tennis Association plans to begin an $800 million renovation of the Arthur Ashe Stadium and construct a new players' building at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, scheduled for completion by the 2027 U.S. Open. The project aims to enhance the fan experience by expanding walkways and adding high-end shops and restaurants, increasing stadium space by 40 percent. The new players' building will include state-of-the-art training facilities and luxury accommodations, ensuring players are fit and able to perform at a high level. This renovation marks the largest single investment in the site's history, doubling down on the growth of tennis in the United States, and will be funded through reserve funds and debt without requiring more land.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to understand why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and Hyper-K in Japan seek to determine if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change differently as they travel, potentially explaining why matter won out over antimatter after the Big Bang. These international collaborations involve over 1,400 scientists from dozens of countries, utilizing cutting-edge technology to explore fundamental questions about the Universe's origins. Discoveries from these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and humanity's place within it.</p>

Instead, the central government is enforcing fiscal discipline on local governments eager to borrow and sell land, signaling that housing will not be the cornerstone of China‚Äôs economic future. Before Trump‚Äôs second term, it was believed that the Chinese government had acted too hastily to deflate the property market bubble.</p>

The WNBPA echoed this sentiment, calling for swift and appropriate action to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all players. The WNBA's "No Space for Hate" campaign includes AI-powered social media monitoring tools to enforce a revised code of conduct, with regulations for fans on social media and sanctions for violations, including blocking or deletion of racist, homophobic, sexist, or threatening content.</p>

          <p>Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) is set to continue its minority government after recent elections, while the far-right Chega party has risen to become a joint second political force alongside the Socialists.

This outcome disrupts decades of stable bipartisan domination, reflecting a broader rightward trend across Europe.

          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to combat the spread of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the US, with the dogs able to sniff out the insect's eggs before they hatch. Four dogs have been scouring parks in the Cleveland area since late last year, uncovering more than 4,000 egg masses, which can produce 30 to 50 lanternflies each. The dogs were trained through a research project led by Virginia Tech University, with owners receiving treats when they spot a new mass of eggs. The female spotted lanternflies typically start to lay their eggs from late August through November, and their egg masses can survive the winter.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer, it's important to understand the disease, its signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed, and treatment options. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer after skin cancer diagnosed in American men, with early prostate cancer generally not causing symptoms, but advanced stages can cause problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen. Screening tests, such as PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, can often detect prostate cancer early, increasing the odds of successful treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the cancer, and can include observation, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defense, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the 12-year deal on access for European boats "will be the end of the fishing industry".</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a brief radio system outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control center responsible for handling flights at Newark Liberty International Airport. The FAA said the control center lost radio frequencies for two seconds at around 11:35 a.m. local time Monday. Despite the outage, all aircraft "remained safely separated," the FAA said in a statement to CBS News.
