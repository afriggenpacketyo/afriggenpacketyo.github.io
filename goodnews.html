          <p>Financial markets in Japan reacted positively to the news of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's planned resignation, with the Nikkei 225 rising significantly. Investors are reportedly optimistic about potential successors like Sanae Takaichi, who is viewed as pro-growth and supportive of deregulation. The announcement also impacted the Japanese yen, which weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields, which continued to rise amid fiscal uncertainty. The article also notes broader trends in other Asian markets and the global oil price. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Norwegians head to the polls, the ruling Labour Party is projected to secure a slim majority in the parliamentary election. Opinion polls suggest its left-leaning alliance will win just enough seats to remain in power, though with a reduced majority compared to 2021. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like rising inflation and the quality of public services. However, global political instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariff policies, also played a significant role, potentially favoring the incumbent government due to a desire for stability.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, Sanae Takaichi and Shinjiro Koizumi are the leading candidates to succeed him, with Takaichi's election potentially making her Japan's first female prime minister. Opinion polls show the two are nearly tied in public support. Experts describe Takaichi as a decisive figure with strong, radical policy ideas, while Koizumi is seen as a "safe pair of hands" who could more easily build consensus. The leadership change occurs as Japan grapples with a cost of living crisis and the aftermath of a new trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has issued a statement confirming that the Premier League club is "not for sale" and that its owner, ENIC, has rejected two preliminary expressions of interest. This announcement follows recent speculation about a potential takeover after the departure of Daniel Levy, the league's longest-serving chairman. The inquiries came from PCP International Finance Limited and a consortium led by Firehawk Holdings Limited. ENIC, which holds nearly an 87% stake in the club, affirmed it has no intention of accepting any offer to sell its interest.</p>

          <p>Germany's football manager, Julian Nagelsmann, drew criticism for his post-match analysis following a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's style of play as reliant on "long balls and second balls" and "not brilliant to watch," which pundits labeled as disrespectful. Critics pointed out that Germany also employed long-ball tactics during the match. The comments are expected to add intensity to the reverse fixture in Belfast, where the German team may face a more hostile reception from fans.</p>

          <p>A social media debate has emerged between former England football stars Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen regarding which of them was the better player at age 17. Owen initiated the discussion, arguing his early achievements, including two Premier League Golden Boots and a Ballon d'Or by age 22, gave him the edge. Rooney responded diplomatically on his podcast, acknowledging Owen's points and stating he looked up to Owen as a young player. While injuries curtailed Owen's career, Rooney went on to become the all-time leading scorer for Manchester United and, for a time, England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by a joint China-US research team has revealed that Mars, like Earth and the Moon, possesses a solid inner core. This finding was unexpected, as models suggested the planet had not cooled sufficiently to form one. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, scientists determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km. The discovery challenges existing theories about planetary formation and could revive the debate over whether Mars once had plate tectonics. The presence of a solid core suggests Mars's thermal history may be different than previously understood.</p>
