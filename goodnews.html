          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending GPU designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls, clarifying that no designs will be modified in China to comply with these restrictions. A spokesperson for Nvidia stated that the company is not sending any GPU designs to China for modification. This announcement follows a report by the Financial Times, which suggested that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. regulations.
