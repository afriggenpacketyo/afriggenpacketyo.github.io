          <p>CNBC's The China Connection newsletter reports that the U.S. and China are navigating a changed relationship following a recent trade agreement that lowered tariffs. While the agreement signals mutual respect, businesses are still wary of tariff uncertainty and are diversifying their supply chains. China is also focusing on self-sufficiency and diversifying its export markets. Despite the temporary tariff relief, tensions remain, and the future of the U.S.-China economic relationship is uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the European Union's second-highest court ruled that the bloc should have disclosed text messages exchanged between a top official and a Pfizer executive during negotiations for coronavirus vaccines. The case, brought by The New York Times against the European Commission, centers on whether such texts are considered public documents under EU law. The court stated that the commission must provide credible explanations for why requested documents cannot be found and explain why text messages related to vaccine procurement did not contain important information. The ruling could set a precedent for transparency within the EU.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country a chance at greatness, marking a shift in U.S. policy towards the nation. Trump stated that the move aims to support the new Syrian government in stabilizing the country and maintaining peace, noting that his administration has already taken steps to restore normal relations. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, and sanctions were imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings, but the new leadership is purportedly reformed.</p>

To address concerns about drug abuse, sales of high-risk medicines like cough and cold remedies will be limited to one small package per person for young people, with measures to prevent overdosing enforced within a year.</p>

          <p>A Fox News article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding vaping on airplanes, with many flight attendants and passengers weighing in on the issue. A Reddit user's question about whether flight attendants know when passengers vape in the bathroom led to various responses, with many claiming that sensors and alarms can detect vaping. Experts emphasize that vaping is prohibited on planes, similar to smoking, and that the FAA interprets the ban on cigarette smoking to include e-cigarettes. Some passengers reported witnessing others vaping discreetly, while others shared stories of alarms being triggered by vaping in the lavatory.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that Iranian officials proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear program. Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, proposed the idea to an American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives. The proposal aims to address American concerns and create a permanent agreement.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, but remain near record highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. While egg prices have dropped, they are still 79% higher than the same month a year ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the U.S. has increased egg imports to stabilize supply.</p>
