          <p>Home Depot's first-quarter results were a mixed bag, with revenue exceeding expectations but earnings per share falling short. However, investors focused on the company's reaffirmation of its full-year guidance and positive sales trends throughout the quarter. CEO Ted Decker expressed optimism about the macro environment, noting improvements in comparable store sales from February to April. The company is also navigating tariff uncertainties by diversifying its supply chain, with a goal to source more than 50% of its purchases in the U.S. and ensure no single country outside the U.S. accounts for more than 10% of merchandise purchases in the coming year.

Trump urged lawmakers to not let SALT (state and local tax deductions) impede the bill's passage. The meeting was described by Trump as a "meeting of love." Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The FDA has outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy Americans. The agency will now demand clinical trials showing safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children, moving away from relying solely on antibody response data. This shift aims to balance regulatory flexibility with scientific rigor, approving vaccines for high-risk individuals based on immunogenicity data while requiring stronger evidence for low-risk populations. The new guidance comes as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls U.S. immunization policy, emphasizing a risk-based approach to vaccination.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly committed to remaining at the helm of the electric vehicle company for at least the next five years. Musk stated that he wants to maintain control over Tesla to prevent activist investors from ousting him. He clarified that his desire for control is not financially motivated but stems from a need to safeguard the company's future direction. Musk's reaffirmation comes after investor concerns regarding his dedication to Tesla, especially given his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency. He plans to dedicate one to two days per week to government work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that dark streaks on Mars, previously believed to be evidence of flowing water, may instead be caused by dry processes. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 satellite images of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae (RSLs). The analysis found that the streaks were not generally associated with factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin, but were more likely found in areas with above-average wind speeds and dust deposition. The study casts doubt on the possibility of habitable environments in those regions.</p>

          <p>Several viral videos circulating online claim to show Chinese fighter jets delivering aid to Gaza, but these claims are false. Fact-checking reveals that the videos are either taken out of context or depict events unrelated to Chinese aid efforts. One video showing aid being airdropped in Gaza dates back to March 2024 and involved other countries, not China. Another video allegedly showing Chinese fighter jets flying over the pyramids is actually footage from a joint military exercise between China and Egypt. There have been no official statements from China confirming airdropped aid.</p>
