          <p>Dame Sarah Mullally, a former NHS chief nurse, has been named the new Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming the first woman to hold the Church of England's most senior role. Her appointment follows the resignation of Justin Welby over a safeguarding scandal and comes at a time of declining church attendance and ongoing debates about same-sex marriage blessings. In her first statement, Mullally condemned a recent synagogue attack and emphasized the Church's role in promoting unity. Her leadership will be challenged by internal divisions and the need to address historical abuse cases.</p>

On the first day of the holiday period, the national railway system handled a record-breaking number of passengers, with several major city stations also setting new single-day peaks. Data from the Ministry of Transport showed year-on-year increases in waterway and air travel as well. The strong start to the holiday is a positive development for Beijing, which has been implementing measures to stimulate domestic consumption and support economic growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes have been spared from new U.S. tariffs due to a Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment. This legislation prevents presidents from regulating the import of "informational materials," a category that includes physical music. The exemption is welcome news for the booming vinyl industry, which has seen a major resurgence driven by younger consumers and superstar artists like Taylor Swift. While consumers and record labels benefit, some U.S.-based record manufacturers argue that tariffs would have helped domestic businesses by making overseas pressing less competitive.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is planning to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services on its mobile banking app later this year. According to sources, the platform will initially allow customers to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin and ether through a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This move signals OnePay's ambition to become a financial "super app" and reflects the growing mainstream adoption of crypto assets. By integrating crypto, OnePay joins other major payment apps like PayPal and Cash App in offering digital currency services to a broad consumer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Against Boycotting Israeli Cinema, Citing Its Role in Dissent</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece argues that the international call to boycott the Israeli film industry is a misguided effort that targets a vital source of artistic and political dissent within Israel. The article uses the film "The Sea," which won Israel's top film award, as an example of a state-funded production that critically examines the Palestinian experience under occupation. It contends that Israeli cinema often tackles difficult subjects like militarism and the occupation, providing a powerful medium to challenge the status quo and change public opinion from within. The author suggests that instead of boycotting, the international film community should support and collaborate with Israeli filmmakers who are questioning their country's direction.</p>

          <p>Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso posted the fastest time during the first practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Alonso, a two-time champion known for his skill on the Marina Bay street circuit, finished 0.150 seconds ahead of Leclerc. Despite the strong showing, it is not widely expected that Aston Martin will be a top contender for pole position. The team is, however, optimistic for a competitive weekend, as the low-speed, high-downforce nature of the track is well-suited to their car's design.</p>

          <p>At a forum on wealth management, experts emphasized that Hong Kong's strength as a global financial hub is intrinsically linked to its role as the primary gateway to mainland China. Panelists noted that as China's economy continues to open up, the city is uniquely positioned to benefit from capital flows, entrepreneurial innovation, and the growing number of affluent Chinese families seeking asset management services. This deep connection allows Hong Kong to act as a "superconnector" between the mainland and international markets. The influx of capital is also expected to lower funding costs and create a favorable macroeconomic environment for business in the city. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In what is being called one of the largest single confiscations of the species, eleven cheetah cubs have been rescued from illegal traffickers off the coast of Somaliland. The coast guard intercepted a small boat and found the cubs packed into bags, arresting five individuals in connection with the smuggling attempt. The rescued animals, which were reportedly malnourished and in poor condition, were transferred to a rescue center run by the Cheetah Conservation Fund. The incident highlights Somaliland's role as a major transit hub for the illegal wildlife trade, which is driving endangered species like the cheetah toward extinction.</p>

          <p>On his show, financial commentator Jim Cramer analyzed the investment appeal of The Campbell's Company, questioning why its stock yields a relatively high 5%. He noted that while the company owns solid brands like Pepperidge Farm and V8, the high yield might suggest underlying weakness or market skepticism. Cramer remarked that the primary justification for buying the stock at its current valuation would be the possibility of a future takeover. He categorized it with other food stocks like General Mills, suggesting they have become undervalued in a market focused on high-flying tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major operator of aviation landing sites, VertiPorts by Atlantic, has begun searching for locations in Los Angeles to build "vertiports" for anticipated electric air taxi services. These electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft could offer an alternative to congested ground traffic, with services potentially starting as soon as next year pending FAA approval. The company is targeting busy urban centers and areas with heavy traffic, with plans to establish two to three dozen sites across the region. This move comes as aerospace companies partner with organizers of the LA28 Olympics to potentially use air taxis to transport people during the games.</p>
