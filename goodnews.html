          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing more sophisticated AI for humanoid robots, aiming to make them capable of performing complex tasks in human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team trains robots like "Ruby" by capturing motion and force data from humans performing the same tasks, teaching the machines nuanced actions. While acknowledging public apprehension, Rus emphasizes that these robots are tools designed with safety measures, intended to augment human abilities and serve as "cognitive superpowers."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, software company Palantir has seen its valuation surge over 1,700%, recently surpassing a $430 billion market cap. A significant portion of its growth is fueled by lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its astronomical rise and strong retail investor support, the company's revenue remains a fraction of other tech giants, leading to a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio that reflects immense investor expectations for its AI-powered future.

          <p>For the first time since 2018, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, with a narrow lead of 28.4% to 28.2%. Experts suggest this shift is likely influenced by the growing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by significantly more boys and tend to yield a higher proportion of top grades. While humanities have seen a decline in entries, subjects like business studies and economics are on the rise, possibly fueled by social media influencers.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as a "girl of the year" for her invention of a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless people stay warm. The idea, conceived when she was 12, was developed into a working prototype by an engineering firm and is now being used by a homeless charity in the city. As part of the honor, which is a partnership with Lego, Rebecca has also been immortalized as one of the company's iconic mini-figures.</p>

          <h2>An Exploration of the Centuries-Old, Evolving Concept of "Genius"</h2>

          <p>This article delves into the historical definition of "genius," tracing how the concept has been understood and debated through the archives of The Atlantic magazine. The meaning has shifted from an innate, god-given spirit to a quality that 19th-century thinkers tried to explain through heredity, leading to the dangerous science of eugenics. The author notes that while modern genetics acknowledges heritability in intelligence, "genius" is also profoundly shaped by social conditions, luck, and timing, making it a complex and subjective label.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point has honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Wang, who dreamed of attending West Point, was posthumously accepted into the Class of 2025 and has now been named an honorary graduate. He was killed while holding a door open to help his classmates escape the gunman, an act of heroism for which the Army previously awarded him its Medal of Heroism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece praises a new report from the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group for charting a middle course on climate change. The author argues that the report, which affirms human-driven warming but questions catastrophic predictions and the intensity of recent weather events, injects needed nuance into a polarized debate. By challenging the "settled science" narrative without dismissing the problem, the report is presented as a model for fostering open, evidence-based discussion that can lead to more rational policy decisions rather than fear-driven responses.</p>

          <p>This article compares two primary strategies for managing overwhelming debt: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle for less than the full amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but harms credit scores and may create a tax liability. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, focuses on creating an affordable repayment plan with lower interest rates, preserving credit but requiring full repayment of the original debt. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial hardship and long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry's two biggest competitors, Beyond and Impossible Foods, are taking different paths to win back consumers. Beyond is reformulating its products with simpler, "cleaner" ingredients and moving away from directly mimicking meat, even dropping "meat" from its name. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on a "meatier" identity, launching more indulgent products and sticking with its heme ingredient to closely replicate the taste of animal meat. These opposing bets will shape the future of an industry vital to environmental and animal welfare goals.</p>

          <p>Louis Naidorf, the visionary architect behind the world's first circular office building, the Capitol Records tower in Los Angeles, has died at 96. Hired at just 24 to design the landmark, Naidorf's concept was inspired by his master's thesis on optimizing office space. His extensive portfolio also includes the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and the Beverly Hilton hotel, and he later became a dedicated mentor and dean at Woodbury University's School of Architecture, leaving an indelible mark on both the L.A. skyline and future generations of architects.</p>
