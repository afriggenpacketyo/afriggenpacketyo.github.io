        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has established a commission of inquiry to investigate serious allegations against Police Minister Senzo Mchunu, who is accused of having ties to criminal gangs and interfering with investigations into political murders. The move follows public accusations from a high-ranking police commissioner that the minister shut down a task force because it uncovered links between politicians and crime syndicates. Ramaphosa has placed Mchunu on a leave of absence, appointing a temporary replacement. The broad investigation, led by the country's deputy chief justice, will examine potential criminal infiltration of the police and justice system.</p>

          <p>Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a compelling four-set final. The world number one showcased remarkable composure to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, avenging a painful five-set loss to Alcaraz at the French Open just over a month ago. This victory marks Sinner's fourth Grand Slam title and his first major win on a surface other than a hard court. The match ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak and further solidified the intense rivalry between the two young stars who have become the dominant forces in men's tennis.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, residents of Butler, Pennsylvania, are reflecting on the event that thrust their small town into the international spotlight. Many locals express a desire for their community to be remembered not for the violence, but for the way they unified in the aftermath. They particularly emphasize the support shown for the family of Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed in the attack. While still stunned by the tragedy, there is a sense of pride in how the community came together, with some residents describing the people of the Pittsburgh area as "tough cookies" who remain resilient.</p>

          <p>In a central Denver neighborhood, a dilapidated 1940s fortune cookie factory has been transformed into a unique public art gallery called the Cookie Factory. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the building nearly a decade ago and, after an eight-year renovation, opened the privately funded space to the public free of charge in May. Precourt's personal mission is for the gallery to be a community gift and a place where people can connect and find mental wellness through art, just as she has. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September, with plans to feature new artists regularly.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are using artificial intelligence to improve their online dating prospects, with one study showing a 333% increase in usage over the past year. AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler help users by suggesting replies, refining their tone, and breaking through conversation lulls. These tools are particularly popular with Gen Z and individuals who feel writing is not their strong suit, serving as a confidence booster. While some users see it as a helpful icebreaker, the trend also raises questions about authenticity and the risk of using AI as a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington has called for major federal investment to upgrade the nation's weather forecasting capabilities. Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, argued that improving forecasting is a "national responsibility" to prevent future disasters. She plans to send President Trump bipartisan recommendations for a "once in a lifetime investment" in the system, including upgrades to Doppler radar and enhanced data analytics for NOAA. The senator warned against proposed budget cuts and privatization, emphasizing that science-based forecasting is crucial for saving lives and is more cost-effective than disaster recovery.</p>

          <p>The third Test between England and India at Lord's is set for a dramatic conclusion after a captivating fourth day of play.

The tourists are chasing a target of 193 to win the match. Earlier in the day, India's bowlers, led by Washington Sundar's four wickets, were brilliant in dismissing England for 192 on a pitch that had become difficult for batting.

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were scheduled to take effect, in hopes of negotiating a trade deal with the Trump administration. The decision provides a window for talks until August 1, after which President Trump has threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on European imports. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue to prepare countermeasures in case a deal cannot be reached. The move temporarily de-escalates a growing trade dispute that could have significant ramifications for the nearly €5 billion-a-day trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of 94-year-old Betty Matteson, whose cherished home on the Guadalupe River was destroyed by the recent Texas floods, is determined to rebuild. The house, a hub for family gatherings for nearly 60 years, was uninsured against floods due to the high cost of premiums in the high-risk area. Despite the immense financial challenge, estimated at half a million dollars, and the increasing frequency of such disasters, the family's emotional connection to the property is driving their decision. They feel that saying goodbye is not an option and are placing the value of their memories and identity above the practical risks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately notified aviation authorities and airlines that the fuel switch lock design on Boeing aircraft is safe. This assurance comes after a preliminary report into last month's fatal Air India 787 crash, which killed 260 people, raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches. The FAA's notification stated that it does not consider the switch design an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory airworthiness directive. This follows the crash report noting that the pilots' voice recorder captured one asking the other why he had cut the fuel, which the other denied doing.</p>
