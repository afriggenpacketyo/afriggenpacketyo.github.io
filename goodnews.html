          <p>Japan's Nippon Steel finalized its acquisition of U.S. Steel, resulting in the delisting of U.S. Steel shares from the New York Stock Exchange.  Despite President Trump's initial opposition and later claims of a "partnership," U.S. Steel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.  The deal follows a reversal of President Biden's earlier block on national security grounds. U.S. Steel will continue operations under its current name.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, is a federally recognized holiday observed annually on June 19.  The name combines "June" and "nineteenth," marking the date in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, announcing the end of slavery in the state.  While the Emancipation Proclamation preceded this event, the 13th Amendment officially abolished slavery nationwide. Juneteenth celebrations vary but often include parades, parties, and cultural events.</p>
