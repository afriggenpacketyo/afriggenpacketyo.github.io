          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient whale that lived 26 million years ago, describing it as a "deceptively cute" but formidable predator. The discovery was based on a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast, a region known for significant fossil discoveries. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who found it, the creature was about the size of a dolphin but possessed sharp, slicing teeth, belonging to a group of prehistoric whales called mammalodontids. This finding provides new insights into the evolution of whales and their adaptation to marine life.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates prompted a significant increase in home loan applications, with refinancing demand jumping 23% in a single week. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that overall application volume rose nearly 11%, driven by homeowners seeking to secure lower payments. There was also a notable rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer more attractive initial rates compared to fixed-rate loans, reaching their highest level since 2022.

          <p>A new book, "A Marriage at Sea," details the incredible survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who spent nearly four months adrift in the Pacific Ocean after a whale sank their sailboat in 1972. The couple endured starvation and illness on an inflatable life raft, surviving on rainwater and turtles before being rescued. The author explores how their shared ordeal and determination to plan a future sailing trip became a powerful bonding experience that strengthened their marriage.

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the Truss government's mini-budget in September 2022, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has fallen to 4.99%. Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a symbolic turning point, indicating more aggressive competition among lenders. Despite this positive development for homebuyers, rates are not expected to fall substantially further, as the Bank of England's future interest rate policy remains uncertain amid fluctuating inflation forecasts. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are set to remortgage their properties this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these challenges, the piece highlights potential paths to recovery, including recent interest rate cuts, new trade deals, and policy reforms aimed at boosting business investment and growth. The analysis suggests that while significant work is needed, London still possesses foundational strengths to rebuild its economic powerhouse reputation.</p>

          <p>Following a devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar, scientists are analyzing the event's data to enhance earthquake forecasting models. The quake, the most powerful in the country since 1912, caused widespread destruction and thousands of deaths. Researchers created a computer model incorporating the Sagaing Fault's history, or "memory effect," which confirmed a powerful "supershear" rupture was anticipated. While precise prediction of earthquakes remains impossible, this research aims to improve long-term probabilistic forecasts, which are crucial for disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning in seismically active regions like San Francisco and Myanmar.</p>

          <h2>California Named Top State for Stargazing, Though Methodology Questioned by Astronomers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ranking by sports betting website Action Network has named California the best state in the U.S. for stargazing, based on factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. However, local astronomers, including the director of the Griffith Observatory, have expressed skepticism about the methodology, particularly its flawed focus on spotting asteroids, which are not visible to the naked eye. While experts agree that California's Dark Sky Places like Joshua Tree and Anza-Borrego offer exceptional views, they emphasize that enjoying cosmic events is more about finding any dark, clear location.</p>
