The company announced a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp reversal from the loss reported in the same period last year. This growth was largely driven by a $4.8 billion increase in the value of its Vision Funds, marking their largest gain since 2021. The positive performance was attributed to gains from investments in both private and publicly listed companies like Grab and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy since a key Supreme Court ruling in June, which limited the scope of such nationwide injunctions but left open other legal avenues. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration contends the amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to parents without legal allegiance to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the Star Wars series 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Carano was dismissed after making social media posts that compared being a Republican in the U.S. to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. Her lawsuit, which sought $75,000 in damages and reinstatement, was financially supported by Elon Musk. While the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, Lucasfilm released a statement describing Carano as a respected professional and said it looks forward to potential future work opportunities.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an independent member of the New South Wales parliament, has resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting two men between 2013 and 2015. The resignation occurred just hours before a scheduled parliamentary vote to expel him, following a failed legal challenge to retain his position while he awaits sentencing. Ward, who is currently in custody, has maintained his intention to appeal the guilty verdict. His departure triggers a by-election for his seat and has been met with criticism from political leaders who argued that one cannot effectively represent a community from behind bars.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for an official peace signing ceremony on Friday. In a social media post, Trump stated that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan will sign a peace agreement, ending a conflict that has lasted for many years and resulted in thousands of deaths. Trump credited his administration's engagement with both sides for the breakthrough, which he described as a historic day for the two nations, the United States, and the world after many previous leaders had failed to broker peace.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, which was later confirmed by experts. This sighting is part of the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, a movement that has been linked to a warming climate. While its colonization of Northern Europe has occurred much faster than models predicted, it remains uncertain whether the species will establish a long-term breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning off the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features eight staterooms, a mosaic pool, a marble fireplace, and a helideck. The U.S. Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned for his role in advancing Russia's malign activities. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit and is part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin in response to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and seeking romantic connections through old-fashioned, in-person events. Organizers of singles events, like Date Cincy in Cincinnati, are seeing a surge in attendance from those experiencing 'swipe fatigue' and a desire for face-to-face interaction. This trend aligns with data showing a 42% rise in attendance at singles events and a significant drop in the stock value of apps like Bumble. Participants cite the benefit of genuine connection and avoiding the misrepresentation that can occur with online profiles.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The celebrity chimp was discovered after a court had ordered Haddix to relinquish her animals to a sanctuary. Animal rights group PETA, which initiated legal action against Haddix, praised the sentence as a measure of justice for the suffering she inflicted on the animals she imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily pill for obesity, orforglipron, successfully helped adults achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial. Participants in the 72-week study lost an average of 27.3 pounds, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible oral alternative to injectables available to consumers by 2026.</p>
