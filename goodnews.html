          <p>China has signaled its willingness to collaborate with the United States on combating fentanyl and repatriating illegal immigrants, two key priorities for the U.S. government. During a meeting between Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue, Wang emphasized the need for "mutual respect" and equality in the relationship. He expressed China's readiness to engage in practical cooperation in law enforcement areas, aiming for outcomes that benefit both countries, while Perdue affirmed his commitment to fostering exchanges and cooperation in areas such as drug control law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) avatars have demonstrated their potential as effective influencers in China, as exemplified by a recent collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and livestreamer Luo Yonghao. Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers in real-time for over six hours on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform "Youxuan", generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales. This significantly outperformed Luo's previous livestream on Youxuan, showcasing the effectiveness of AI-generated avatars in engaging audiences and driving sales; Luo's avatars were built using Baidu's generative AI model, which learned from five years of videos to mimic their jokes and style.</p>

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he has fathered. Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance, which they will not be able to access for 30 years, as he wants them to build their own lives independently. The 40-year-old says he wrote a will due to the risks associated with his job, which involves defending freedoms and earning enemies. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, calling them "totally absurd" and denying any wrongdoing in connection to failing to properly moderate Telegram to reduce criminality.</p>

These reinforced bicycles, provided by the nonprofit World Bicycle Relief, are available for community members to transport pregnant women, fetch HIV medication, or take injured individuals to the hospital. Community health extension workers (CHEWs) report a significant increase in households reached each week and a reduction in travel time to health facilities. Ugandan health authorities acknowledge that transportation is a major challenge for CHEWs, and the distribution of bicycles is seen as a crucial step in saving lives.</p>

Defense and space companies are vying for a slice of the project's pie, especially after budget cuts at NASA, with Lockheed Martin and Boeing touting their credentials at the Paris Air Show.

The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for amblyopia screening in all schools in England, as is done in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The condition, where one eye is weaker than the other, is best treated before the age of seven, but many children are not diagnosed until it is too late for effective treatment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2¬Ω times by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberry, tomato, kiwi, and mango, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The coating, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, demonstrates universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits.</p>
