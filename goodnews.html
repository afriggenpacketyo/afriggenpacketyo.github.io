          <p>During his Senate confirmation hearing, President Trump's nominee for United Nations ambassador, Mike Waltz, pledged to "make the UN great again" by directly confronting China's growing influence within the organization. The former Florida congressman argued it is "absurd" that China is still treated as a developing nation by most UN agencies, giving it favorable status. He accused Beijing of strategically placing its personnel in key international bodies and vowed to restore American leadership and ensure the U.S. maintains a strong voice at the UN.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders expressed support for President Trump's reversal on Ukraine policy, which includes new arms sales and the threat of tariffs against Russia. However, top EU officials also voiced concerns, urging the U.S. to "share the burden" of arming Ukraine, questioning the arrangement where Europe pays for U.S.-made weapons. While welcoming the tougher stance on Moscow, some EU diplomats found the 50-day peace deadline to be too long. The development highlights a complex dynamic, with Europe seeking stronger U.S. partnership while also asserting its own strategic and financial interests.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Catcher Will Smith Thrives Despite Being Underappreciated</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a three-time All-Star and leading the National League in batting average, Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Will Smith remains one of baseball's most overlooked stars. Overshadowed by high-profile teammates, Smith's consistent excellence both at the plate and behind it has been a cornerstone of the team's success. This season, fully healthy after battling injuries in previous years, he has posted elite numbers, drawing comparisons to legendary catchers like Buster Posey. While Smith himself is unconcerned with public recognition, his teammates and manager emphasize his immense and underappreciated value to the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced it will expand its production of popular gasoline-powered vehicles by adding the Cadillac Escalade SUV and more light-duty pickup trucks to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. Production of the Escalade will move from Texas, while the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks will be added to meet strong consumer demand, supplementing existing production in Indiana. The move is part of a larger $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities. This decision notably allocates a plant, previously expected to be exclusive to electric vehicles, for retooling to accommodate traditional internal combustion engine products.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified the administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chip to China, stating the U.S. is not providing its best technology. Lutnick emphasized that the chip being sold is effectively Nvidia's "fourth best" and is slower than the top-tier versions used domestically. The strategy, he explained, is to keep Chinese developers reliant on the American technology ecosystem without giving them a competitive edge. This policy reversal is a significant win for Nvidia, which had previously seen the Chinese market effectively closed by export controls.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic depicting an erotic scene, which was stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II, has been returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii. The artwork, dating to the first century, was repatriated from Germany after the heirs of its last owner contacted Italian authorities to arrange its return. The mosaic, which likely decorated a bedroom floor, is considered a work of extraordinary cultural interest.

Collins was imprisoned for 22 years and Boles for 30 years before being paroled. Following the emotional court proceeding that overturned their convictions, DA Alvin Bragg noted that the original murder of 85-year-old James Reid remains unsolved.</p>
