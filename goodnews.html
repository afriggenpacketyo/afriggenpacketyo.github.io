        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's assertion that Tylenol is a cause of autism, scientific experts are emphasizing that the claim is not supported by evidence. Medical professionals state that complex neurodevelopmental disorders like autism are linked to a combination of thousands of genetic variants and environmental factors, not a single medication ingredient. The rise in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and improved screening methods, particularly for girls. Experts reiterate that extensive research has consistently debunked any causal link between vaccines and autism.</p>

          <p>After nine years of negotiations, the European Union and Indonesia have concluded a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), a move reportedly accelerated by US tariff policies. The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports to Indonesia, such as car parts and pharmaceuticals, while opening up investment opportunities in key sectors like electric vehicles. For Indonesia, the agreement provides tariff-free access for approximately 80% of its exports to the EU, including palm oil and textiles, strengthening its position as the EU's fifth-largest trading partner.</p>

The auction is part of a free public event called "Secret River," hosted by the Oconee River Land Trust to raise funds for its conservation efforts. The event at Cine in Athens will also feature music and a talk by a local river expert, Oconee Joe, who recently guided Thrasher on a paddling trip to capture the river's scenic beauty from the water.</p>

          <p>During a United Nations summit co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, France officially recognized the state of Palestine, joining several other European nations like the UK, Canada, and Belgium in the move. The announcement, made by President Emmanuel Macron, was met with applause and signifies growing international support for a two-state solution amid the ongoing war in Gaza. This diplomatic shift highlights the increasing isolation of Israel on the global stage, with approximately 80% of UN member states now acknowledging Palestinian statehood, though the US and Israel boycotted the event.</p>

          <p>European stocks opened higher, influenced by a Wall Street rally driven by Nvidia's announcement of a major investment in OpenAI for data center development. U.K. home improvement company Kingfisher was a standout performer, with its shares surging 18% after it raised its financial outlook due to rising domestic demand. European chipmakers also saw gains following the Nvidia news, although equipment manufacturers ASML and ASMI experienced declines after ASMI lowered its guidance for the second half of the year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months and more than 20 GP contacts. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals to catch serious illnesses like cancer earlier, particularly in younger patients.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, a major storm currently in the Atlantic, is forecast to weaken as it travels east but could still bring a wet and windy weekend to the United Kingdom. Weather models are currently in disagreement about the exact path of the storm's remnants, with one predicting heavy rain across the UK and another suggesting it will track further south towards Spain and Portugal. Before its potential arrival, the UK is expected to experience a period of drier, albeit chilly, weather, providing a brief respite after a month of above-average rainfall.</p>

          <p>This article addresses several key topics in Formula 1, including whether Max Verstappen poses a realistic threat to the McLaren drivers for the championship title. Despite a recent win, the points gap is considered substantial with only seven races remaining. The piece also delves into the complexities of tire compound choices, explaining why drivers in Baku preferred the medium tire over the soft for qualifying laps. Additionally, it discusses F1 President Stefano Domenicali's comments about shorter race formats, clarifying they likely refer to creating better highlight packages for new audiences rather than shortening the Grands Prix themselves.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 40th anniversary of Europe's historic 1985 Ryder Cup victory, a turning point that saved the competition from fading into irrelevance due to decades of American dominance. Tony Jacklin, who took over as captain in 1983, is credited with transforming the team's fortunes by demanding better conditions for his players and by successfully convincing Severiano Ballesteros to rejoin the team. After a narrow loss in 1983, Jacklin's revitalized European squad secured a decisive victory at The Belfry in 1985, ending a 28-year US unbeaten streak.</p>

The changing interest-rate environment is allowing companies to refinance on more favorable terms, potentially rebuilding investor confidence in a sector previously considered too risky.

          <p>The article explores how modern football seems to be re-embracing tactics once championed and criticized in Sam Allardyce's management style, such as an emphasis on set-pieces and a more direct, long-ball approach. Top teams are increasingly using tall strikers and forgoing a possession-based game, a strategy Allardyce used effectively at clubs like Bolton Wanderers over two decades ago. Allardyce comments that his methods were "ahead of the game" and that the current trend reflects a more sensible use of a team's skills, moving away from the "pandemic" of playing out from the back.</p>

          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist, has been released from prison in Egypt after nearly six years and reunited with his family. His release came after he was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, reportedly following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah was arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years for "spreading false news." His imprisonment drew international condemnation and prompted his mother to undertake a lengthy hunger strike to call for his freedom, which gained significant support in the UK.</p>
