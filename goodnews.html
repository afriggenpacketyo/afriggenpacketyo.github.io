          <p>A stone carving discovered near Zhaling Lake in China is being hailed as a significant archaeological find from the era of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China. According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, it is the only known stone carving from that period that remains at its original site. The inscription details a journey to a mountain, which scholars believe may be connected to the emperor's legendary and obsessive quest to find an elixir of immortality, offering a rare glimpse into ancient Chinese history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12, citing a lack of progress and expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin's actions. During the same visit to Scotland, Trump also announced a major trade agreement with the European Union. The deal avoids a threatened 30% tariff, instead imposing a 15% duty on most EU goods while securing commitments for Europe to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ostensibly private trip to his Scottish golf courses has provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with invaluable, if unconventional, diplomatic access. This article analyzes how Starmer is leveraging the face time to build a personal relationship with the American president, a crucial task for advancing UK interests on issues like trade and the crisis in Gaza. However, it also highlights the inherent risks for Starmer, who must carefully navigate Trump's freewheeling and unpredictable style to achieve substantive results for his country.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential trade war just days before a deadline threatened by President Trump. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU imports, a rate lower than the 30% initially proposed, and includes a European commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy. While this agreement provides some stability, the administration still faces outstanding negotiations with other major partners, including China and Mexico, and the overall legality of the tariff strategy remains under challenge in federal court.</p>
