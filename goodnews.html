          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 19:07:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found the order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, stating it sent a message that lawyers must adhere to the party line. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. The ruling is a victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions against firms associated with disfavored causes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, now fulfilling all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's closure of a loophole that allowed Chinese-made goods worth under $800 to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices and started adding import charges for U.S. customers. The company states pricing remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model and actively recruits U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <h2>Wall Street Rebounds After Losses Stemming From Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:49:52 EDT</div>

          <p>Wall Street stocks recovered from losses incurred after President Trump imposed global tariffs a month ago, marking the longest winning streak in two decades for US stocks. Major US indexes all rose, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both up 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing 1.4%. The rebound was fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, exceeding analysts' predictions, though some experts caution that the full impact of Trump's tariffs remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on climate change impacts in the U.S. This collection aims to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed, complementing the National Climate Assessment. The organizations will invite scientists to submit original work or review articles, encouraging those released from writing the sixth National Climate Assessment to participate.

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale parade through Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing and White House involvement have fueled speculation that Trump is using the Army's birthday to stage a grand military parade. The cost of the event is unclear, but it will require involvement from multiple federal agencies and may cause infrastructure damage.</p>

The question of whether AI can be conscious has significant implications, particularly as technology advances.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a prime challenger to Britain's traditional main parties. The party won 677 seats across various councils, seizing control of several authorities from the Conservatives. Farage hailed the results as a sign that Reform had overtaken the Tories as the main opposition to Labour. The elections marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory last year, with Reform gaining traction and denting the vote share of both Labour and the Conservatives.</p>
