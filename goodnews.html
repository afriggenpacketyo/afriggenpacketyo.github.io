          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with the European Union, reached just before a looming August 1 deadline for imposing new tariffs. The agreement reportedly includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, a substantial reduction from the threatened 30% rate. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing $600 billion in the United States. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a "good deal" following tough negotiations aimed at rebalancing the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denise Huskins, whose 2015 kidnapping was initially dismissed by police as a hoax, is now collaborating with law enforcement agencies to reform interrogation techniques. Huskins, whose story was featured in the Netflix series "American Nightmare," now speaks to officers about science-based interviewing to help them better support victims and avoid false accusations. After her kidnapper was caught and she was vindicated, Huskins and her husband sued the Vallejo Police Department, reaching a $2.5 million settlement. Her advocacy work aims to turn her traumatic experience into a positive force for change in policing.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting a nearly 12% revenue drop in its fiscal fourth quarter, Nike surpassed analyst estimates and indicated that financial pressures from its "Win Now" initiatives are expected to ease. The footwear giant warned that existing tariffs could increase its costs by approximately $1 billion. However, the company maintains a stable cash position and has a strong record of returning value to shareholders, having raised its dividend for 23 consecutive years. This performance has led some analysts to view Nike as a potential comeback story among the underperforming "Dogs of the Dow" dividend stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a query to ChatGPT about making the most of one's money, the AI outlined several key strategies, terming them a financial "cheat code." The primary recommendations include automating savings and investments, aggressively living below one's means, and starting to invest early, even with small amounts, to leverage compound interest. The AI also emphasized the importance of building a three-to-six-month emergency fund to prevent financial setbacks. Additionally, it advised strategically using credit to build a good score without accumulating debt and focusing on increasing income through high-value skills rather than just cutting expenses.</p>

          <p>India's batters held on for more than five sessions to secure a remarkable draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, keeping the series alive at 2-1. Chasing a large deficit, India reached 425-4, with captain Shubman Gill scoring a century before Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar also made centuries in an unbroken 203-run partnership. England's efforts on the final day were thwarted by India's resolve and a crucial dropped catch by Joe Root.

          <p>Colombian forward Luis Diaz is set to transfer from Liverpool to Bayern Munich after the clubs agreed to a deal worth up to £65.5 million (€75m), including add-ons. Liverpool had previously rejected a lower bid from the German champions for the 28-year-old player. Diaz was left out of a recent pre-season friendly due to the speculation and has been permitted to travel to Europe for a medical. Since joining Liverpool from Porto in 2022, Diaz has scored 41 goals in 148 appearances and was a key part of their Premier League title win last season.</p>

This success follows a period of inconsistent box office performance and critical reception for the Marvel Cinematic Universe post-"Avengers: Endgame." With an 88% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film's positive reception suggests that a focus on quality is helping reinvigorate the franchise.</p>

Norris, on a different hard-tyre strategy, finished second, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured the final podium position ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

The current suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension will prevent an immediate escalation, insiders do not anticipate major breakthroughs on specific issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. team for more clarity on the threshold required to ease tariffs related to the flow of fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>
