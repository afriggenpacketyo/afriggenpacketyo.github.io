          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to hit a record high, alongside the Topix reaching an all-time high, following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's election of Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. Positioned to become Japan's first female prime minister, Takaichi is expected to advocate for a "high-pressure economy" and maintain the Bank of Japan's accommodative monetary policy. This shift in leadership and economic direction, focusing on expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships, led to significant gains across real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and bond yields saw increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million UK consumers who bought Apple or Samsung smartphones between 2015 and 2024 could be eligible for a share of a £480 million payout, averaging around £17 each. This potential compensation stems from a lawsuit brought by the consumer campaign group Which? against US tech giant Qualcomm at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. Which? alleges that Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices, forcing Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential components, which subsequently raised smartphone costs for consumers. Qualcomm has previously stated the case has "no basis."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of a "swag gap," where partners have noticeably different styles or effort levels in appearance, is gaining traction on social media. While some argue it can lead to relationship conflicts, with one partner feeling disrespected or unproud, others like Jessica Raialo believe it doesn't have to be negative if both partners appreciate each other's unique styles. Relationship experts suggest that attempting to change a partner's appearance can be detrimental, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and avoiding unhealthy power dynamics. The article highlights that "swag gap" can also extend beyond fashion to differences in success or confidence.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is set to announce a "first-job bonus" offering young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home, funded by £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride will detail proposals including welfare reforms, a reduction of 132,000 civil servants, and cuts to the foreign aid budget. These plans aim to "reward work" and demonstrate fiscal responsibility, as the party seeks to counter political rivals and improve its credibility amidst recent electoral defeats. The article also mentions proposals to end welfare claims for "low-level mental health problems" and reserve benefits for UK nationals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly urged negotiators to "move fast" on a Gaza peace deal, expressing strong optimism for a swift resolution as crucial talks commence in Cairo. These discussions, involving Israeli and Hamas delegations, along with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, aim to finalize a proposed exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. While Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for an announcement on hostage releases "in the coming days," he maintained that a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is not on the table. Trump's intervention highlights a significant push to end the two-year conflict, despite ongoing bombardments and logistical hurdles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Tripp" (Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity) aims to establish a crucial transport link through Armenia, connecting Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, as part of a peace agreement between the two long-time adversaries. While the plan promises significant US investment and economic benefits for the region, this article highlights the complex geopolitical challenges, including Russia's weakened but persistent influence and Iran's expressed concerns. The route, intended to be managed by a private US company, also draws interest from Europe as a potential "middle corridor" bypassing Russia. Despite these competing global interests, Trump's intervention has notably brought a temporary cessation of hostilities on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border.</p>

His departure, which saw him escorted from the stadium, underscores deeper systemic issues at Ibrox, now redirecting scrutiny towards the club's sporting director and chief executive for their role in player recruitment.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is poised to resume partial production this week, starting with its engine factory in Wolverhampton, following a major cyber attack that forced a month-long shutdown of its global operations. While a full return to capacity is expected to take several weeks, this restart brings welcome relief to JLR's extensive network of suppliers, many of whom have endured significant financial strain. The UK government has provided a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support these suppliers, though some industry figures have criticized the direct impact of this measure on struggling small businesses.

This analysis suggests the core issue is not Salah's goal-scoring form, which is expected to recover, but rather Liverpool's broader struggle with game control and defensive shape compared to the previous season.
