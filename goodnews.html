          <p>China is heavily investing in the digitalization of its museums and cultural heritage sites to preserve history, strengthen national pride, promote technological progress, and enhance soft power. This initiative aims to engage new generations through interactive technologies like AI and VR, exemplified by the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo at Dafo Temple. Despite economic challenges, Beijing continues to prioritize cultural initiatives, contrasting with budget cuts in cultural heritage in some Western countries. The goal is to build a "cultural superpower" by bringing China's ancient history to life. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer emphasized that the scheme would be reciprocal and not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. Kemi Badenoch, a Conservative Party leader, criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door." An agreement in principle is expected at an upcoming summit, though details on age eligibility and caps on numbers are still under discussion. </p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for warning it would raise prices due to tariffs, urging the retailer to absorb the costs instead. Walmart CFO John David Rainey cited significant price increases due to tariffs as a challenging environment. Trump insisted that Walmart and China should "EAT THE TARIFFS" to avoid charging customers more. Walmart responded that it would continue working to keep prices as low as possible, while acknowledging the reality of small retail margins. </p>

          <p>Home Depot is entering its critical sales period, with its Memorial Day outdoor sales event running through May 28. The company's Q2 is typically its highest revenue quarter, driven by gardening and seasonal trends. However, tariff uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates present challenges. Analysts predict a tough first quarter due to unfavorable weather and weak consumer sentiment, and investors are keenly focused on forward guidance. The trajectory of Home Depot's stock is closely tied to housing turnover, with mortgage rates needing to dip below 6.5% to stimulate the market. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a three-eyed predator that lived over 500 million years ago. The "sea moth," found in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies, was about the length of an index finger and had a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth. The discovery revealed that the creature was more complex than previously known radiodonts, with a segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills. This finding provides new insights into the diversity of life during the Cambrian period. </p>
