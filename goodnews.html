          <p>A 50-year-old document marking Margaret Thatcher's official consent to run for the Conservative Party leadership has been discovered in a cardboard box in a Somerset garage. The nomination paper, signed by Thatcher on January 27, 1975, was a pivotal first step in her ascent to becoming party leader and later Prime Minister. The letter was part of a collection belonging to former Conservative MP Sir Edward du Cann and is now set to be auctioned, where it is expected to fetch up to £100,000. Experts have described the find as a sensational and historically important discovery.</p>

          <p>As Halloween costume prices rise 11% from last year, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes from thrifted materials. For nine years, he has been collecting, washing, and redesigning second-hand garments to ensure all children can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their financial situation. Waggoner spends over $5,000 annually on his project, hosting free giveaway events that have been busier than ever this fall. He believes his effort inspires a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate costumes for others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid significant market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can offer a sound approach for risk-averse investors. These exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide structural downside protection and can generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Fed considers rate cuts. The strategy's appeal lies in its ability to offer reliable defense against equity drawdowns and a diversifying source of income. Investors are advised to seek funds managed by institutional professionals and be cautious of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to long-held stereotypes, a new study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a key motivating factor for men. Experts suggest that beyond economics, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when single. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report men are more likely to seek their services.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing to its gate at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved one plane's wing striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway collisions and near misses at U.S. airports.</p>

          <h2>NASA Scientist Proposes 'Radical Mundanity' Theory for Lack of Alien Contact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To address the Fermi Paradox—the mystery of why we haven't found evidence of alien life—a NASA astrophysicist has proposed a theory of "radical mundanity." The hypothesis suggests that while other intelligent civilizations may exist in the Milky Way, they are likely only slightly more technologically advanced than humans. This means they would face similar immense challenges with interstellar travel and communication, lacking capabilities like faster-than-light travel or Dyson swarms. Consequently, they would remain undetectable and eventually abandon cosmic exploration, explaining the apparent silence in the universe.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has dangerously relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. Restoring a stable off-site power connection is considered critical for nuclear safety, as it is needed to cool the plant's six shutdown reactors and prevent a potential catastrophic incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines have needed restoration since Russia's invasion.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and restrict social media access until age 16 to promote better mental health. To successfully implement this delay, she advises parents to begin teaching responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key lessons include understanding online privacy, not sharing personal information, and recognizing time as a precious resource. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules and using parental controls once devices are introduced to ensure moderation.</p>

According to Buffett, buying gold is merely a bet that someone else will be more fearful of currency in the future and pay a higher price for it. He contrasts this with his preferred investments in productive assets, like farms and businesses, which are valued based on what they can deliver over time.</p>
