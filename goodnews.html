          <p>New South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, from the Democratic Party, pledged to prioritize pragmatism to address the crisis stemming from his predecessor's martial law imposition. In his inaugural address, Lee emphasized enhancing trilateral cooperation with Japan and the United States, while remaining open to dialogue with North Korea. He also expressed a willingness to continue the previous administration's approach to compensating wartime forced labor victims, emphasizing consistency in international relations. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, surpassing his conservative opponent, with a voter turnout of 79.4%, the highest in nearly three decades. The new president aims to restore the economy and national security, adopting a pragmatic, national-interest-centered approach to diplomacy. Optimism is tempered by the challenges he faces, including navigating relations with North Korea and negotiating trade issues with the U.S.</p>

          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, England, unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks, built around 213 A.D. during a tumultuous period. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, with curator Barbara Birley planning further analysis for pigment traces. Director of excavations Andrew Birley noted the rarity of such finds, emphasizing the fort's grandeur and the symbolism vital to Roman soldiers. The carving is set to be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year, highlighting the enduring influence of Roman culture in Britain.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is remembered as a voice for democracy and a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. Mann's literary works reflected his life spent in exile after escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929 for "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain". During his exile, Mann delivered radio speeches to his compatriots, condemning the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust, and his views were reflected in his work. Mann's legacy lies in his literature and his steadfast opposition to fascism.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities, with a focus on improving regional connectivity. Greater Manchester and the West Midlands will receive significant funding for tram network extensions, while West Yorkshire will begin building its mass transit program. The investment marks a shift away from stringent Treasury rules that have historically favored London and the South-East, and the chancellor is expected to emphasize the need for growth that is felt more broadly across regions. The transport investment marks Reeves' first open move away from the stringent rules in the Treasury's Green Book, which is used by officials to calculate the value for money of major projects.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% has taken effect, impacting global steel exporters. While countries like Canada, Mexico, and European nations face higher levies, the U.K. received a temporary reprieve, with tariffs remaining at 25% as trade deal details are finalized. Trump indicated that the U.K. warranted "different treatment" due to the recent Economic Prosperity Deal, potentially leading to the removal of tariffs. However, he warned that the levy on the U.K. could increase to 50% if the White House deems the agreement not fully compliant. Uncertainty remains for the U.K. steel industry amid global oversupply and weak demand.</p>

          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y.

Despite the rebound, total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to last year. Tesla is facing tighter competition, especially from Chinese EV makers like BYD, which outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time in April.</p>

          <p>The UK has been granted an exemption from increased US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but the White House has warned that this is conditional on the ratification of May's trade pact between the two countries. While most shipments face 50% tariffs, UK products will remain subject to the previous 25% rate for now. The exemption could be lifted if the UK does not comply with the terms of the economic prosperity deal, leaving the situation uncertain. The UK government is working with US officials to agree on terms and protect British businesses.</p>
