          <p>Tensions flared between Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark and Atlanta Dream's Rhyne Howard during their recent game, leading to a brief scuffle and exchange of words. The incident occurred shortly before the end of the first quarter, with Clark appearing to say "I'm not scared of you." The game was closely contested, with the Fever ultimately winning by a single point, ending on a 10-1 run. The incident follows a recent flagrant foul committed by Clark on Angel Reese, which prompted an investigation into alleged hateful comments directed at Reese by fans.</p>

The piece highlights that clean energy and climate-smart investments are not only environmental imperatives but also economic opportunities.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge in China. Cases have been detected in international travelers at airports in California, Washington, Virginia, and the New York City area. Health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island, and Hawaii, have also reported cases. Preliminary data suggests the NB.1.8.1 variant has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially making it more transmissible, but is not better at evading the immune system.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The core inflation is expected to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

The explosion, which killed the suspected bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, and injured four others, is being investigated by the FBI as domestic terrorism. Despite the destruction, the clinic's in vitro fertilization lab remained intact, and the thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos were unharmed.
