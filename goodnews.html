          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand its ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, to cover a larger area of English waters.

The proposal aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasizing the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans.

          <p>China has initiated mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation merges binary and stochastic logic, enhancing fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications. The chip sidesteps US chip restrictions by overcoming fundamental barriers in traditional computing, which include power consumption and architectural limitations. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers. </p>
