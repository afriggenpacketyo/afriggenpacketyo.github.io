          <p>Fitness experts are endorsing 'Zone Zero' workouts, an activity level so light it feels effortless, yet provides genuine health advantages. This approach keeps heart rates below 50% of maximum, encompassing gentle activities like walking or stretching. While not a substitute for vigorous exercise, it encourages daily movement for improved blood sugar, circulation, and stress reduction, forming a foundational layer for overall fitness. This low-intensity movement can be easily integrated throughout the day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes why ASML Holding, a key semiconductor equipment company, is predicted to surpass Palantir Technologies in market capitalization within three years. While Palantir's AI software demand has led to a significant stock surge and high valuation, ASML's near-monopoly in EUV lithography machines positions it for accelerated growth amid rising AI chip demand. The article suggests ASML's more attractive valuation and critical role in advanced chip manufacturing could lead to greater upside, despite Palantir's current momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and US are ushering in a 'golden age' of nuclear power, with five new commercial deals announced ahead of President Trump's visit. Plans include a new advanced modular reactor plant in Hartlepool and mini-reactor-powered data centers in Nottinghamshire. The 'Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy' aims to streamline projects and align safety standards to meet rising electricity demand and AI's energy needs. Critics, however, warn about high costs, slow development, and nuclear waste disposal challenges.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Edgar, who served from 1991 to 1999, was credited with stabilizing the state's finances during a recession by cutting the budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent. A moderate Republican, he later grew uneasy with his party's shift to the right and supported Kamala Harris in 2024. Edgar is remembered for his integrity and significant contributions to Illinois state government.</p>

          <h2>Danny Murphy Argues Manchester United's Player Selection, Not System, is the Core Issue</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system. Despite improvements in team compactness, individual errors and players being used in unnatural roles, like Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield position, are costing the team points. Murphy suggests that while the system has potential, the manager's failure to recognize and rectify these personnel misplacements prevents consistent performance. The article highlights the need for players to be comfortable and effective in their assigned roles.</p>

          <p>'Buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans are gaining immense popularity among consumers, offering interest-free installment payments as an alternative to traditional credit cards. An estimated 86.5 million Americans used BNPL in 2024, challenging the credit card industry's revenue streams. Major banks and financial institutions, however, view these loans with caution, primarily because BNPL activity creates a 'giant black hole' in understanding consumer credit quality. This lack of visibility poses significant risks for assessing borrowers' overall financial health. The financial landscape is evolving with these new payment options.</p>
