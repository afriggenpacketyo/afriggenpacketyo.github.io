        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shares initially jumped nearly 17% before settling to a 7% increase, continuing a week-long trend that has seen the stock rise by over 58%. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential to streamline payments and attract interest from major companies like Amazon and Walmart. The GENIUS Act aims to enhance consumer protections and promote the use of blockchains for global dollar transactions, potentially fostering wider adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The bill's passage signals increasing regulatory clarity, which is driving investor confidence in the stablecoin market. Optimism in the market is growing as regulatory frameworks become more clear. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, citing a lack of significant inflationary pressure from tariffs. In an interview, Waller emphasized the importance of proactively addressing potential labor market slowdowns by easing monetary policy. While the FOMC recently voted to hold interest rates steady, Waller's perspective suggests a willingness to act sooner rather than later to support economic stability. His stance contrasts with other officials who prefer to wait for more conclusive data on the impact of tariffs. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures as investors reacted positively to the prospect of lower borrowing costs. The market may be volatile in the coming months.

          <p>Taichi Kokubun, a member of the Japanese pop group Tokio, has been removed from the TV program "The Tetsuwan Dash" following allegations of past misconduct. The decision was made after a third-party investigation found that Kokubun had breached compliance rules on multiple occasions, reportedly involving behavior that could be considered sexual harassment. While details of the misconduct remain undisclosed to protect privacy, the TV network's president confirmed it was not a criminal matter. Kokubun has since issued an apology and announced an indefinite suspension of his activities. This incident occurs amidst increased scrutiny of Japan's entertainment industry, following other sexual misconduct scandals. The industry is trying to ensure greater compliance in light of recent events.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms across parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The UKHSA has issued an amber heat-health alert for England, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services. Some areas are at risk of tropical nights where temperatures do not drop below 20C. The hot weather has also led to a surge in wildfires, with firefighters responding to more than 500 across England and Wales this year. Authorities are urging the public to take precautions to prevent fires and protect vulnerable individuals during the heatwave. Climate change is contributing to more frequent and intense heatwaves.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children aged up to 17. The research divided states into categories based on the strength of their gun control laws and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with more permissive gun laws saw a notable increase in children's deaths from gun violence, while states with stricter laws experienced stagnant or declining rates. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations to protect children. The study suggests that policy choices can significantly impact the safety of children with regard to firearms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Invasive insects, such as the Asian tiger mosquito and the Asian hornet, are increasingly prevalent across Europe due to milder winters and global trade, causing significant harm to human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. These species compete with native insects, spread diseases, and damage crops, costing the EU billions annually. The Asian hornet, for example, preys on crucial pollinators like honeybees, while the brown marmorated stink bug damages fruit and vegetable crops. Efforts to manage these pests include trapping, nest removal, and biological controls, but experts emphasize that complete eradication is nearly impossible. Climate change is exacerbating the problem, making it crucial to implement stronger controls and develop sustainable alternatives. Invasive species are a major threat to native plants and animals in Europe.</p>

Despite a nerve-wracking interview with Iranian officials, he successfully crossed the border and is now safe in Azerbaijan. He urges other Americans traveling abroad to register with the U.S. State Department's STEP program. He is thankful for his Iranian guide.</p>
