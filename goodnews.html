        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiff is proposing a new parking plan that could make it the first UK city to charge higher permit fees for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and other large cars. The 10-year strategy aims to reduce congestion and air pollution by introducing a surcharge for oversized or highly polluting vehicles, including diesel cars. The plan, which divides the city into three new zones and creates new permit types for carers and NHS workers, has drawn mixed reactions from residents. While some support the environmental goals, others, including tradespeople and students, worry about being unfairly penalized and the potential impact on their livelihoods and safety.</p>

          <p>England's all-time leading wicket-taker, James Anderson, is set to sign a contract extension with Lancashire, continuing his professional cricket career beyond his 44th birthday. After retiring from international cricket in 2024, Anderson had a successful 2025 season with the county club, excelling in both the County Championship and T20 cricket. His impressive performance in the shorter format, where he took 20 wickets, also earned him a deal with Manchester Originals in The Hundred. The new deal will extend his professional career to 25 years, having made his debut for Lancashire in 2001.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit, surpassing analyst estimates due to sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips. As a key producer for clients like Nvidia and Apple, the company's revenue also rose by 30.3% year-over-year. Citing the strengthening AI megatrend, TSMC's CEO raised the company's 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure for the year. The strong performance was primarily driven by growth in its most advanced 3nm and 5nm chip technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Maryland mother of five, Melissa Tran, has been released from federal custody after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over five months. Tran, a refugee from Vietnam, was taken into custody during a routine check-in due to a non-violent theft conviction from two decades ago. A federal judge ordered her release, finding her continued detention unnecessary, but she still faces the possibility of deportation. Her lawyer argues that her past crime has been reclassified and is no longer an aggravated felony, and that she has built a stable life in the community for decades.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations and provided a strong profit forecast for the final quarter of the year. The carrier expects to earn between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, well above analysts' estimates. While its total revenue for the third quarter fell slightly short of projections, the airline's growth strategy and investments in premium cabins and customer experience appear to be paying off. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the company's economic resilience to winning and retaining loyal customers, even as the industry faced challenges from overcapacity and fluctuating demand earlier in the year.

          <p>Asset management giant BlackRock is increasing its focus on the cryptocurrency market by retooling one of its money market funds to specifically serve stablecoin issuers. The updated fund is designed to comply with new US legislation that provides a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. This move aims to position BlackRock as a leading reserve manager for the rapidly growing stablecoin sector, which analysts predict could surge to $4 trillion by 2030. The firm already manages the majority of the reserve fund for Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Most Heirs Replace Their Parents' Financial Advisors After Receiving Inheritance</h2>

          <p>A new report from Cerulli Associates reveals that only 27% of beneficiaries plan to retain their parents' wealth advisor after inheriting assets. The study, which surveyed investors with at least $250,000, found that the primary reason for switching is not a preference for self-directed investing, but rather that most heirs (50%) already have an established relationship with their own advisor. Another key factor is the lack of a pre-existing relationship with the benefactor's advisor. The research suggests that advisors need to encourage clients to involve their children in financial discussions earlier to build trust and increase the chances of retaining family assets across generations.</p>

          <p>In an address to the German parliament, Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for enhanced European cooperation on economic and defense matters to counter external security threats and prevent economic decline. He emphasized the need for Germany and NATO to bolster their defense capabilities, stating that peace must be founded on economic, political, and military strength. Merz also praised the recent ceasefire in Gaza, thanking US and Israeli leaders for their roles. He reiterated his call to use frozen Russian assets to finance weapons for Ukraine, arguing it would secure the country's military resilience for years to come.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary halt to the Trump administration's planned layoffs of federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston indicated she believes the layoffs are likely illegal. The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit from unions representing federal employees, who argue the administration is using the shutdown as a pretext for politically motivated workforce reductions. The shutdown, now past the two-week mark, has already left many federal workers furloughed and unable to access essential human resources services for health care and other benefits.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that its most important competition has been held outside of Japan. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days. To ensure authenticity and respect for the sport's deep cultural and religious traditions, organizers shipped 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament brings Japan's national sport to a global audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules and rituals.</p>
