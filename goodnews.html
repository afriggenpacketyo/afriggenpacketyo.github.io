        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 401(k) plan, a cornerstone of modern American retirement savings, was created almost by accident in 1981 by benefits consultant Ted Benna. While working on a client's plan, Benna discovered an obscure provision in the tax code, Section 401(k), that he realized could be used to create tax-advantaged employee savings accounts with employer contributions. This innovation quickly led corporations to shift away from traditional pension plans, placing more responsibility for retirement planning on individual employees. The article reflects on how this single interpretation of a tax clause fundamentally reshaped financial planning for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it is rapidly advancing a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. While the exact number is unconfirmed, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, following security checks. This official government scheme follows a private initiative by Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three children to the UK for privately funded care. The move comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with its health system devastated by the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks, though no immediate damage was reported from the relatively weak tremor. Officials have advised residents to be aware of potential aftershocks in the coming days. The event highlights the presence of the Ramapo Fault line, which, while not as active as those in California, periodically causes minor quakes in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is gaining traction among those seeking to leave the traditional workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents achieve this by practicing extreme frugality, maximizing savings, and investing aggressively to build a nest egg 25 times their annual expenses. The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," emphasizes valuing time and freedom over material possessions. The goal is not just to stop working, but to gain the liberty to pursue personal passions and live a more intentional life. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA superstar Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes, recently stated that he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the number. Instead, he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and opportunities that he is proud of and that align with his values. Financial planners cited in the article praise this mindset, suggesting that focusing on cash flow and tangible goals, rather than fixating on accumulating wealth, can lead to greater financial health and personal satisfaction. This approach encourages making intentional financial decisions that support a desired lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have detailed the creation of a new material, CHSN01, a high-strength cryogenic steel designed for use in nuclear fusion reactors. The material addresses a critical challenge in fusion energy: finding a substance that can withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium and the immense magnetic forces inside a reactor. This "super steel" has already been deployed in the construction of the world's first fusion power generation reactor, placing China in a leading position in a key area of materials science. The development marks a significant step toward making clean, near-limitless fusion energy a reality.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has joined the ranks of tech billionaires following his company's successful stock market debut. Field's journey began when he dropped out of Brown University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a program that encourages young entrepreneurs to build things instead of attending college. After early struggles, Figma gained traction with its collaborative, browser-based design tools, becoming an essential platform for companies like Microsoft and Uber. The company's recent IPO marks a major success after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell's major league baseball career with the Angels in 1961 was remarkably short, consisting of just one hit in seven games.

Now 84, he reflects on his baseball experience with no regrets, having found greater satisfaction in his family life and in his mission to make a positive difference in the lives of others through philanthropic work.</p>

The article suggests that while Scheffler's robotic consistency is impressive, it can lack the drama that captivates fans. His self-effacing role in the film, which pokes fun at his real-life arrest earlier this year, presents a more fun-loving and relatable personality. This Hollywood appearance is seen as a positive step for his public image and for the sport, adding a layer of humor to golf's top player.</p>

          <p>While the United States and other major Western powers are cutting their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries are bucking the trend by increasing their contributions. Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy have all recently pledged to boost their development spending, driven by a sense of solidarity and a recognition of global interconnectedness. This shift comes as the U.S. dismantles its primary aid agency, creating a massive funding gap for global health programs. While these smaller nations cannot fully replace the U.S. contribution, their actions point toward a more collaborative future for foreign aid.</p>
