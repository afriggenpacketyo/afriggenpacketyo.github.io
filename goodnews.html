          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, a British earth scientist and dean at City University of Hong Kong, views China as a leading force in climate science due to its substantial funding, advancements in green technology, and governmental backing for environmental research. Horton, who previously worked in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia, emphasized China's proactive investments in green technology and reforestation initiatives, contrasting them with other countries' cutbacks. He believes China's superpower status and pro-environment stance make it a compelling place for climate scientists to work and contribute to global environmental solutions. He highlights the availability of funding and governmental support as key factors in China's potential to drive significant progress in addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>Cognac producers in France face challenges from climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Winemakers are adapting to grapes ripening earlier and becoming sweeter due to global warming, while also dealing with tariffs from the U.S. and China that have impacted exports. Despite these difficulties, many family-run businesses are maintaining traditions, such as barrel-making, and exploring new markets through organic cognac and cocktails. The region's cognac houses, including those founded by immigrants, continue to innovate while preserving the quality and heritage of their renowned brandy.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles in an innovative effort to save them from extinction. The glitter is mixed with the voles' food, and conservationists track the voles' movements by identifying the glitter in their droppings. This method helps conservationists understand the voles' territory and habits, enabling them to make targeted environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks. The project aims to help the species disperse and thrive in their natural habitats, addressing the challenges they face from habitat loss and predators.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, paleontologists are investigating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils to understand how these dinosaurs died. The team, led by Professor Emily Bamforth, is excavating the site, known as the "River of Death," to uncover clues about the catastrophic event that led to the dinosaurs' demise. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a large herd migrating when a flash flood swept through the area, killing them. The site offers a unique opportunity to study dinosaur biology and community structure, with ongoing discoveries revealing new insights into this ancient ecosystem.</p>
