He notes that despite a strong debut, the company's valuation has not yet reached excessive levels, and he is encouraged by its solid growth, improving fundamentals, and impressive underwriting standards. While Cramer expresses a personal preference for competitor Affirm, he suggests Klarna's stock is a viable purchase at current levels, citing the success of its peers as a positive indicator for its future growth potential.

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the United States to defend its leadership in artificial intelligence against significant advances from China. Michael Kratsios, of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the competitive gap has narrowed and warned that the U.S. is in danger of losing its preeminence. He advocated for exporting cohesive American "AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to global partners. This strategy aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to bolster the security of allied defense supply chains.</p>

          <p>Online real estate platform Opendoor announced significant leadership changes, naming former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The move, which follows the resignation of the previous CEO amid investor pressure, was met with strong market approval, as the company's stock jumped 30% in extended trading. Eric Wu, the company's first CEO, is also rejoining the board. These appointments are aimed at steering the company forward after a period of intense scrutiny and volatility that saw it risk delisting from the Nasdaq earlier in the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are studying Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Researchers hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' 'dark DNA'—the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. These spiders possess three times more dark DNA than humans, which may enable them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By cross-referencing genetic data with detailed observations of each species' unique colors, songs, and mating dances, the team hopes to unlock general principles of how variation is produced across the natural world.</p>

The initiative is part of a broader trend of deepening economic ties, with Kazakhstan being a primary destination for China's Belt and Road Initiative investments.

          <h2>U.S. House of Representatives Votes to Repeal Authorizations for Iraq Wars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House passed a measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The amendment, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, reflects a growing sentiment in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Proponents argue that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military action without contemporary congressional approval. The measure is attached to the annual defense spending bill, though similar efforts have previously stalled in the Senate.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary data from the CDC for 2024. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, it has steadily declined, though it remains in the top 15. Overall U.S. death rates fell for the third consecutive year, with declines seen across most demographic groups. Heart disease and cancer continue to be the top two leading causes of death, accounting for over 40% of all fatalities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision lets a lower court's ruling stand, which blocked the state's restrictive policy from being enforced against this specific student while his legal challenge proceeds. The state law in question prohibits transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. In its unsigned order, the court noted the decision was not a ruling on the merits of the case but was based on standards for emergency relief.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its decades-long policy and will now allow and provide N95 masks to federal firefighters battling wildfires. For years, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations like Canada and Australia. The policy change comes after reports highlighted the health risks firefighters face from smoke inhalation, including increased rates of cancer and organ failure. The decision also follows pressure from federal lawmakers who criticized the agency for neglecting its duty to protect firefighter health.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person after a surge in his company's stock. Ellison's net worth climbed to $393 billion on Wednesday morning, edging past Musk's $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The jump was fueled by a more than 40% rise in Oracle's share price, driven by a positive outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and new artificial intelligence deals. However, by the end of the trading day, Oracle's shares had retreated slightly, allowing Musk to reclaim the top spot.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has finally shared her thoughts on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada." The movie's demanding boss, Miranda Priestly, was widely seen as being based on Wintour. In a recent interview, Wintour called the film a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's fantastic performance as the character. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but not knowing what the movie was about, and ultimately feeling that the fashion industry's initial concerns about the portrayal were unfounded.</p>
