Following the stock sales, Karp owned about 6.43 million shares of Palantir stock, worth about $787 million based on Thursday's closing price. The sales were connected to a series of automatic share sales to cover required tax withholding obligations tied to vesting restricted stock units, according to filings.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields stumbled from recent highs as President Trump escalated trade war rhetoric, proposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. These announcements sent investors seeking safety in bonds, driving yields down. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 5 basis points to 5.013%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 7 basis points to 4.479%. This move follows a volatile week for bonds, initially triggered by concerns over Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.</p>

          <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation. Investors can lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, and these investments are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000. Current national averages for CD yields are 1.99% APY for 1-year CDs, 1.69% APY for 3-year CDs, and 1.70% APY for 5-year CDs. However, top CDs from online banks offer much higher rates, with some short-term options exceeding 4.40% APY (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance their mortgages face challenges due to high interest rates and limited housing inventory. The article provides an overview of current mortgage and refinance rates, with the average 15-year mortgage at 6.08% and the 30-year mortgage at 6.89%. Experts suggest that borrowers may find some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and they also recommend strengthening credit profiles to secure better rates.

          <p>A global study involving 20 institutions has found compelling evidence that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 did not originate in Wuhan, China, contradicting the lab leak theory. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, tracing the virus's origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. The findings indicate that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic emerged. The study challenges claims by the White House, which suggested a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heatwaves in the ocean. During a heatwave in Papua New Guinea in 2023, researchers measured clownfish and found they got shorter by a small percentage over a few months. The study suggests this shrinking may be an adaptation to help clownfish survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, indicating that being smaller has advantages in a hot climate, and the study adds a layer of complexity to the story of the world‚Äôs oceans.</p>
