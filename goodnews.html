          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed strong confidence that the Trump administration will secure significant trade deals with key partners before a looming August 1 deadline. He stated that the threat of steep tariffs on nations including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico has successfully brought them to the negotiating table. Lutnick dismissed concerns that the tariffs would lead to higher consumer prices, asserting that Americans can expect "shockingly low" prices and that the policy will ultimately benefit U.S. manufacturers.

          <p>Following a viral incident where a couple was awkwardly caught on camera during a concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously advised his audience to be prepared for the "Jumbotron Song." The previous incident involved a man and woman, later identified as executives from the same company, who appeared to be having an affair, leading to the man's resignation. Martin's lighthearted warning was made during a subsequent show in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens of UAE Team Emirates won his first-ever Tour de France stage after a successful solo breakaway on stage 15. Usually serving as a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar, Wellens was given the freedom to attack on the hilly route to Carcassonne and finished well ahead of the chase group. Pogacar, who was thrilled for his teammate, successfully retained his overall lead in the general classification.</p>

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has committed to reducing the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This pledge comes in response to public anger over the state of the nation's waterways and new data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. Reed acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that the industry's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing."</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance is understood to be planning a family vacation in the Cotswolds region of England next month, following a visit to London. The trip has garnered attention due to Vance's past critical statements about the UK and European governments, including accusing them of suppressing free speech and a claim that London was "not English any more." The visit comes at a time when tourist traffic from the UK to the US has reportedly seen a decline.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "common ground" on divisive issues is often impossible in today's political climate. Instead, he advocates for seeking "neutral ground"—shared activities or interests, like surfing, where people with opposing views can connect as friends without focusing on their differences. He argues that these personal connections are more important than ever and can lead to more productive discussions about disagreements.</p>

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that validating a child's feelings, rather than dismissing them, builds emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. By modeling self-connection and allowing children to express their full range of emotions, parents can protect their long-term mental health and self-esteem.</p>
