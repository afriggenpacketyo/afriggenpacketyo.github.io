          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 11:45:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of $10,000 deposits in long-term versus short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs), noting a current reversal where short-term rates are higher. Despite this, long-term CDs ultimately yield significantly more interest due to their extended duration, with a 5-year CD earning nearly $2,300 compared to $440 for a 1-year CD. The decision depends on individual financial goals and liquidity needs, as rates are predicted to decline later in the year. Savers are advised to take a strategic approach to maximize their returns (not investment advice).</p>

British rider Oscar Onley completed the podium, moving up to seventh in the general classification standings in his Tour debut. Geraint Thomas, who spent much of the day in a breakaway, was caught by the peloton late in the stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that addressing male infertility could be crucial for boosting America's declining birth rate, a goal of the Trump administration. While policy discussions often focus on female fertility treatments like IVF, male factors are equally likely to cause infertility yet remain largely undiagnosed and undertreated, placing disproportionate medical and emotional burdens on women. The article suggests that expanding access to male-specific infertility care, such as funding for specialists and insurance coverage for key services, offers a politically viable and less invasive alternative to solely focusing on IVF, which faces internal conservative divisions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs, topping $118,000, fueled by record inflows into bitcoin ETFs, with Ether also experiencing a significant rally. The cryptocurrency market's ascent is partly attributed to speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve leadership and the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is anticipated to increase the federal deficit, often seen as a positive catalyst for bitcoin. This rally triggered substantial short liquidations, further propelling prices upward. Institutional interest in bitcoin ETFs has grown significantly since President Trump hinted at a potential change in Federal Reserve leadership (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that emergency vaccination programs for five major infectious diseases—Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever, and meningitis—have reduced deaths and infections by approximately 60% over a 23-year period. Analyzing 210 incidents across 49 countries, researchers found that these swift vaccine deployments prevented much larger outbreaks and generated an estimated $32 billion in economic benefits, primarily by averting deaths and disability. The study, backed by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, underscores the critical importance of rapid and effective vaccine roll-outs as a cost-effective countermeasure against increasing global health risks.</p>

He highlights the average American credit card debt of $37,000 and the psychological effect of plastic, which he claims leads to 12-18% more spending compared to cash. Ramsey, who hasn't used credit cards in decades, advocates for debit cards, emphasizing their similar functionality without the associated debt risk.
