          <p>After a WWII bomber crash left 11 dead and designated as 'non-recoverable,' four crew members are finally returning home. The Army Air Forces plane, Heaven Can Wait, was hit by enemy fire off the Pacific island of New Guinea on March 11, 1944. A recovery mission involving elite Navy divers descended 200 feet to reach the sea floor. The remains of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick are being interred with military honors.</p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Finds Increase in Fake Reviews in 2024</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 23:51:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that around 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. This increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improved detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process relying on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Boosting and member fraud account for the bulk of fake reviews, while paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered more pernicious.</p>
