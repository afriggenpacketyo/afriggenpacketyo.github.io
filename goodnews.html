          <p>Denmark has adopted restrictive migration policies, becoming a pioneer in Europe in this regard, surprising many as these policies are driven by the center-left rather than the far-right. The shift occurred after the 2015 European migration crisis, with the Social Democrats, led by Mette Frederiksen, taking a tougher stance on immigration. Frederiksen argued that high migration levels threatened social cohesion and welfare, justifying stricter rules. This approach has been successful in winning votes, though critics view it as a cynical ploy for power.</p>
