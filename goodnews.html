          <h2>NATO Members Commit to Increased Defense Spending Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent summit, NATO members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a move praised by the US. However, the decision has raised concerns among some nations, like Spain, about the economic impact on social programs and national debt. Experts note the commitment is significant but politically challenging, especially for countries with high debt levels who may need to cut public services or raise taxes. The agreement's flexibility in defining defense-related infrastructure spending might offer some relief, but the high cost of security remains a major fiscal hurdle for the alliance.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed US fears that the company's advanced chips could be used by the Chinese military, arguing that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. Speaking ahead of another trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of US export controls, stating they are counterproductive to maintaining American tech leadership. He emphasized the need to engage with China's large developer community to ensure the US tech stack becomes the global standard. This stance highlights the difficult balance Nvidia is trying to strike between complying with Washington's policies and accessing the significant Chinese market.</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Economy Avoids Recession with 1.4% Q2 Growth, But Recovery Outlook is Cautious</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:05:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession, reporting a 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter, primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector. This expansion reverses the previous quarter's contraction and beats economists' expectations, partly attributed to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential US tariffs. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, warning of significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year. Officials have maintained a conservative growth forecast, reflecting the ongoing volatility in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philippine Department of National Defense has confirmed that Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. renounced his Maltese citizenship before his appointment in 2023. The clarification comes after reports that he had acquired a Maltese passport, which could have disqualified him from holding high public office under Philippine law. The department stated that Teodoro surrendered the passport before a 2021 senatorial run and that the congressional appointments committee was aware of the renunciation. Officials suggested the resurfacing of this information is an attempt to undermine the secretary, who is a prominent critic of China's actions in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A team of British and Egyptian archaeologists has unearthed multistory "tower houses" in the ancient Egyptian city of Buto, located in the Nile Delta. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, the researchers identified the dense architectural remains, which date back to the Ptolemaic Period (332-30 B.C.). These structures, supported by thick foundation walls, suggest the city was a thriving, densely populated urban center. The excavation also revealed granaries and a ceremonial road linked to the cobra goddess Wadjet, providing new insights into the urban, religious, and economic life of the region.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June year-over-year, surpassing economists' forecasts, largely due to a temporary tariff truce with the United States and strong demand from other markets.

Imports also saw a modest 1.1% increase, marking the first rise this year, though it missed expectations.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers used their first two picks in the Major League Baseball draft to select a pair of teammates from the University of Arkansas. With the 40th and 41st overall picks, the team chose left-handed pitcher Zach Root and outfielder Charles Davalan. Root, a junior transfer, was noted for his versatile pitch mix and strong performance in the SEC. Davalan, a sophomore, was praised for his contact-hitting ability, plate discipline, and impressive season with the Razorbacks. Both players were key contributors to an Arkansas team that reached the College World Series.</p>
