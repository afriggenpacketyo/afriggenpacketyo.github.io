          <h2>Live Aid's 40th Anniversary Prompts Reflection on Its Legacy and Controversies</h2>

          <p>Marking 40 years since the monumental Live Aid concerts, reflections on the event highlight its unprecedented global reach and fundraising success for Ethiopian famine relief. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 broadcast united billions and set a template for future benefit concerts. However, the anniversary also brings renewed scrutiny over its flaws, particularly the lack of African performers and female artists in a lineup that was overwhelmingly white and male. Critics argue it reinforced a patronizing image of Africa, a charge Geldof dismisses, while supporters point to its long-term impact on debt relief and charitable initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Campaigners Urge English Labeling on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 03:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based nomenclature, arguing the current system poses a serious risk to individuals with allergies. Campaigners, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, highlight that consumers cannot be expected to recognize allergens listed under their scientific names. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, it is not a legal requirement. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, known as INCI, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for ingredient identification, but critics insist safety should be prioritized with clearer labeling.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ousmane Dembélé has emerged as a pivotal player for Paris Saint-Germain, earning praise as the season's best player from coach Luis Enrique for his transformative impact. Once known for being a late bloomer with disciplinary issues, Dembélé has become the linchpin of PSG's aggressive, high-pressing strategy, contributing significantly with goals and assists. His move to a central position has unlocked his potential, making him a relentless force that pressures opponents and creates opportunities. This evolution is credited to a combination of the team's ecosystem, the coach's unwavering belief in him, and Dembélé's own newfound commitment and leadership on the field.</p>

          <p>As Barcelona's football sensation Lamine Yamal turns 18, he has already established himself as a central figure for both his club and the Spanish national team, drawing comparisons to Lionel Messi which he modestly deflects. Having played over 100 first-team games, his on-field maturity and remarkable statistics belie his youth. Despite his fame, he remains grounded by his family and connected to his working-class roots in Mataro. With his contract renewed until 2031 and a staggering 1 billion euro buyout clause, Barcelona has secured a player who not only embodies immense talent but also a calm ambition and the mindset to handle immense pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study offers a surprising perspective on the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet, which becomes the Brahmaputra in India. Contrary to fears that the dam could cause droughts downstream, the research suggests it might actually increase water levels during the dry season. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, the study found that low-flow water levels in February rose by over 50%. This indicates that managed water release from the dams could help alleviate dry conditions, providing a more stable water supply to downstream regions like India, rather than creating a crisis.</p>
