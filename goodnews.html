          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts for a third round of high-level trade talks in Stockholm next week. The discussions aim to resolve ongoing trade disputes and could lead to an extension of the current pause on significant tariffs that both nations have imposed on each other's exports. Both Washington and Beijing have expressed cautious optimism about the progress of the negotiations. The meeting signals a continued effort to de-escalate economic tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>For the first time, artificial intelligence models from Google and OpenAI have achieved scores equivalent to a gold medal at the prestigious International Mathematical Olympiad. While five human contestants earned perfect scores, the AI's performance marks a significant milestone in the development of advanced reasoning capabilities. The models solved five out of six complex problems within the competition's time limit, a substantial improvement over previous years. This rapid progress highlights the accelerating advancement of AI, though human ingenuity still holds the top spot in creative problem-solving.</p>

          <p>Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District have achieved a new record in academic performance, with math and English scores rising for the second consecutive year to exceed pre-pandemic levels. The gains were seen across all tested grade levels and demographic groups, including Black students and those from low-income families. Despite this impressive recovery, a significant portion of students, nearly two-thirds in math, are still not meeting state grade-level standards. Officials credit targeted initiatives like tutoring and increased instructional time for the positive trend, which is outpacing many other districts.</p>

The child's father has been hailed as a hero for pulling the child from the animal's jaws, likely saving the minor's life. The child was airlifted to a trauma center and has since been discharged in satisfactory condition. Park officials later tracked and euthanized the cougar, which was wearing a GPS collar, and stated there is no ongoing danger to visitors. Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's saw a dramatic surge of over 30% in highly volatile trading, reminiscent of past meme stock rallies. The stock's trading volume was nearly 17 times its 30-day average, with no specific company news to explain the movement. The company has become a target for retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets due to its high short interest, where about 50% of its shares are sold short.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding of credit card grace periods, explaining that they primarily apply to new purchases, not late payments. Most credit cards offer a window of 21 to 25 days after a billing cycle ends, during which a balance paid in full incurs no interest. However, this grace period is often forfeited if a balance is carried over from the previous month. For late payments, issuers are not required to offer a grace period, and fees or penalty APRs can be applied immediately, though some may offer a brief, informal window for customers with a good history.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard University study analyzing over 58,000 women suggests that the sex of children in a family may not be a simple 50/50 probability. Researchers found that after having two children of the same sex, the likelihood of the third child also being that same sex increases, a pattern they call a "weighted coin toss." For example, after three boys, the chance of a fourth boy was 61%. The study suggests a potential biological tendency within families toward having boys or girls, with factors like maternal age at first birth showing a small but significant correlation.</p>
