          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to begin trade talks this week in Switzerland, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the two largest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will represent China, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the United States. Since President Trump's return to the White House, he has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing on some US goods. These talks represent a significant effort to find a resolution to the trade tensions. Optimism surrounding the talks has led to anticipation for potential positive outcomes.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the mixed reactions to the Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, both first-time attendees. Some fans felt the stars were dismissed, particularly during Khan's red carpet interview where the Vogue livestream hosts seemed unaware of his global fame. While Vogue noted Khan's clip was included and Nwodim referred to Khan being the first male Bollywood star to appear at the event, the camera quickly panned away from Dosanjh. The incident sparked online disappointment, with many feeling the South Asian superstars deserved more respect on the international stage.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ross Douthat analyzes how American television portrays the rich through aspiration, judgment, and reassurance, noting that these spirits often coexist. He discusses "Your Friends & Neighbors," an Apple TV show, which eliminates aspirational identification by depicting the wealthy as unhappy and insecure, despite their affluence. The show serves as a direct response to meritocratic status anxiety, portraying the rich world as a place where unhappiness is magnified and financial security is an illusion. Ultimately, Douthat questions the truth of this bleak portrayal, suggesting that while some cultural trends have stripped away elements of fun associated with upper-class lifestyles, many wealthy individuals still manage to enjoy their lucre.</p>

The Night Light team builds trust with the women, offering support, food, and a listening ear, which has led to increased reporting of sexual assault and concerns about children.</p>
