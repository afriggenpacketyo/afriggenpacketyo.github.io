          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding forecasts and keeping it on track for its annual 5% target. However, this growth has slowed from the previous quarter, and concerning indicators like sluggish retail sales and a deepening real estate slump are fueling calls for more government stimulus. While industrial output and exports show resilience, economists warn of underlying fragility, citing disinflationary pressures and the need for deeper structural reforms to sustain long-term growth.

          <p>Satellite radio company SiriusXM is shifting its strategy by launching its first ad-supported subscription plan for in-car listening, named SiriusXM Play. This cheaper option aims to convert more free-trial users into long-term customers, mirroring a trend seen with streaming services like Netflix. While core content like Howard Stern and live sports will remain ad-free, the new tier is a significant move for a brand long known for its commercial-free experience, as it seeks to boost revenue amid a competitive audio market.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's fixed income and equities trading revenues saw significant jumps, benefiting from market volatility, while investment banking fees also rose. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical tensions, and high fiscal deficits, even as the bank boosted its dividend.

          <p>A review of Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," examines its unique approach to autobiographical fiction. The novel centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful memory from her teenage years involving a relationship with an older photographer, grappling with gaps in her recollection. By labeling the deeply personal work a novel, Ullmann challenges the conventions of memoir, using the format to explore how forgotten experiences and absences shape personal history just as much as vivid memories do.</p>
