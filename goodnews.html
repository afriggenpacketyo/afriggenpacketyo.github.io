        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This profile explores the career of Judd Apatow, from a comedy-obsessed teenager on Long Island to one of Hollywood's most influential figures. It details his early days interviewing comedy legends for his high school radio station, his struggles as a young stand-up comedian, and his pivotal mentorship under Garry Shandling on 'The Larry Sanders Show.' The article highlights his signature style of blending raunchy humor with genuine vulnerability, which defined acclaimed but often short-lived projects like 'Freaks and Geeks' and blockbuster films like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin.' Apatow's enduring impact is seen in his role as a mentor to a new generation of comedians and his dedication to exploring the human condition through comedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fast-food giants like McDonald's are losing their morning customers to convenience stores, which have become a formidable competitor in the breakfast market. In a recent three-month period, morning traffic to fast-food chains grew by only 1%, while food-focused convenience stores saw a 9% increase. Chains such as Wawa and Casey's General Store are successfully luring diners with a wider variety of quick, quality options and perceived value. As stressed consumers cut back on eating out, the breakfast meal is often the first to be skipped or eaten at home, making the convenience and diverse offerings of modern c-stores increasingly appealing.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value increased after CEO Elon Musk revealed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of stock. This significant insider buy was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing shares to jump 8% in premarket trading. The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has faced pressure from slowing sales and the end of certain EV incentives. The move is seen by some analysts as Musk reinforcing his commitment to the company's future in AI and robotics ahead of a shareholder vote on a new, potentially massive pay package.

          <p>Ruth Weiss, a Jewish journalist, writer, and human rights activist who fled Nazi Germany for South Africa, has passed away at the age of 101. Her life was dedicated to fighting injustice, drawing on her experiences with both the Holocaust and apartheid to advocate for tolerance and humanity. Weiss became a renowned journalist, using her platform to expose the brutalities of apartheid and support African independence movements, forming connections with figures like Nelson Mandela. Until her death, she remained a sought-after contemporary witness, and her final book, published in 2025, called for a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on mutual recognition and rights.</p>

          <p>The horror genre has experienced a banner year at the box office, surpassing $1 billion in domestic revenue for the first time since 2017 with hits like 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' and 'Sinners.' This success is notable not just for its financial performance in a struggling market but also for the critical acclaim these films have received, positioning them as potential Oscar contenders. The article explores the trend of creators with comedy backgrounds, such as Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, finding success in horror. Film critics suggest that comedy and horror share a similar DNA, relying on timing, craft, and surprise to elicit a physical reaction from the audience, whether it be a laugh or a scream.</p>

          <h2>More Renters Are Using On-Time Payments to Build Their Credit History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 07:12:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of renters are reporting their monthly rent payments to credit bureaus as a strategy to build or improve their credit scores. According to a TransUnion survey, 13% of renters participated in such services in 2025, a practice particularly beneficial for those with limited or no credit history. Including on-time rent payments in a credit report can lead to an average score increase of 60 points. While this can be a valuable tool, especially for younger generations like Gen Z, experts advise consumers to carefully consider the costs, ensure the service reports to all three major bureaus, and understand the potential negative impact if they miss payments.</p>

          <p>China plans to dramatically expand its energy storage capacity, aiming to nearly double its current world-leading levels by 2027 with an investment of approximately $35 billion. According to a new action plan, the country's new-energy storage system capacity, which is primarily based on lithium-ion batteries, will exceed 180 gigawatts, up from 95 gigawatts as of June. The plan also seeks to promote the development of alternative storage technologies, such as hydrogen and compressed-air systems. This strategic push is deemed essential for stabilizing the power grid as China rapidly increases its reliance on intermittent renewable energy sources to meet its carbon neutrality goals.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, provides unconditional cash transfers to every pregnant resident—$1,500 during pregnancy and $500 monthly for the infant's first year. New research shows the program has successfully lowered rates of maternal postpartum depression, stabilized family housing, and improved infant health outcomes, saving millions in neonatal intensive care costs. Born from the community advocacy that followed the city's water crisis, the universal, place-based approach aims to prescribe away poverty without the stigma of traditional welfare programs. The model has garnered bipartisan support and is expanding to other communities as a preventative public health intervention.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched one of the world's most ambitious conservation projects, aiming to eradicate invasive predator species like possums, rats, and stoats by 2050 to protect its unique native birds. A key part of this strategy involves mobilizing a nationwide network of volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set traps in local parks and their own backyards. These introduced mammals, which arrived with human settlers, have driven dozens of native bird species to extinction and threaten many more, particularly flightless birds like the kiwi. Experts believe this community-driven approach is crucial for success, turning conservation into a social movement to restore the nation's natural heritage.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped charges against two British men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China. Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry had denied violating the Official Secrets Act by allegedly providing information prejudicial to the state. Prosecutors informed the court that they would offer no evidence, stating that the case could not continue as it did not meet the legal threshold for trial. Mr. Cash described the two-year ordeal as a “nightmare” and expressed relief that “justice has been served,” while the Home Office called the outcome “disappointing given the seriousness of the allegations.”</p>

The visit signals a deepening of the “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” between Beijing and Islamabad.

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies after ruling the company arbitrarily shut down the Instagram account of well-known adult content creator Esperanza Gomez. The court found that Meta had illegitimately restricted her freedom of expression by closing the account, which she used for her work, without a clear justification. While Meta argued Gomez violated its nudity rules, the court noted inconsistent application of these policies, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling requires Meta to adjust its terms so users are clearly informed about how to challenge content moderation decisions.</p>
