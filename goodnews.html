Experts also stress the importance of honing soft skills like problem-solving and communication, which AI cannot replace, and focusing on the "5 Cs": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage, and communication.

          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, citing his ability to build a coalition of working-class New Yorkers. The endorsement follows a chaotic Democratic mayoral primary debate where Mamdani clashed with front-runner Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a state assemblymember and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, is running on a progressive platform, including a rent freeze and fare-free public transportation. The debate also addressed controversies surrounding Cuomo, including sexual harassment allegations, which he denies, asserting the report was political and false.</p>

          <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen commented on the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. to face federal charges, months after his mistaken deportation to El Salvador. Van Hollen emphasized that the Trump administration initially flouted the Supreme Court and the Constitution in this case. The senator asserted that the issue is about Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and the rights of all individuals. The administration will now have to present its case in a court of law, as it should have done from the beginning, according to Van Hollen.</p>

          <p>Tesla stock rebounded after a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump led to a significant drop in the company's market capitalization. Despite the initial decline, analysts suggest that the investor base remains largely unfazed by the drama. There were reports of a potential truce between Musk and Trump, though a White House official denied any interest from Trump in a call with Musk. Analysts believe that reconciliation between the two figures would be beneficial for Tesla shares.</p>
