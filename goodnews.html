The concept aims to create a new model for urban food distribution, though it is part of a broader, more socialist-leaning platform that has drawn both support and criticism.

This decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's new leadership, which has argued that the sanctions hinder reconstruction and economic recovery after the civil war.

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's major economic bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for workers in industries like food service and hairdressing. The proposal would create a new deduction for tip income, though versions differ between the House and Senate on income caps and deduction limits. Proponents frame it as a benefit for the working class, but critics argue it's a flawed way to help low-wage workers, as many already earn too little to owe federal income tax. Labor advocates suggest that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to provide financial relief.</p>

He is known for taking some moderate stances and occasionally voting against former President Trump's positions. Johnson is entering what could be a competitive Republican primary, potentially challenging the incumbent governor, Larry Rhoden, who took over after Kristi Noem joined the Trump administration.</p>
