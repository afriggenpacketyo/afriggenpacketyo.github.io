          <p>President Trump's tax agenda faces challenges as Republican lawmakers negotiate the details of the proposed tax cuts. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text, but the bill could undergo significant changes. With a narrow Republican majority in the House, reaching a consensus on a fiscally responsible package will be difficult. Key proposals that could impact millions of Americans are under discussion. The process involves multiple steps and must fit within a limited budget framework, adding complexity to the negotiations.</p>
