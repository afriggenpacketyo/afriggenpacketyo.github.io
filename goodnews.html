          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has signaled its readiness to engage in discussions with other countries regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for various industries, including robotics and new energy vehicles. The ministry emphasized that it has already approved qualified export applications, taking into account the legitimate needs of other nations and adhering to established laws. China is open to enhancing communication to facilitate compliant trade, especially as rare earths remain a key element in trade negotiations with the United States, with Vice-Premier He Lifeng expected to attend upcoming meetings to address these issues. This move reflects China's approach as a responsible major power, balancing domestic interests with global demand. </p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, currently the United States head coach, has stated that a return to Tottenham Hotspur is "not realistic" at this time, following the club's decision to sack Ange Postecoglou. Pochettino, who previously managed Tottenham for five years, emphasized his commitment to his current role with the US national team. Postecoglou's departure came despite leading the club to their first trophy in 17 years, creating speculation about potential replacements. Pochettino's remarks clarify his immediate future and dampen speculation about a return to his former club. </p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered six scoreless innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the team ultimately fell to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 2-1 walk-off loss. Despite Yamamoto's strong performance, including nine strikeouts, the Dodgers' offense struggled to capitalize on opportunities, stranding multiple runners. Shohei Ohtani extended his hit streak, but the Cardinals managed to break the scoreless tie late in the game, securing the win with a single in the bottom of the ninth. Yamamoto expressed that such games are part of baseball, where perseverance is key even when the team's offense is not at its peak. </p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, shares her experience of returning to work part-time after having a baby, emphasizing the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in the teaching profession.

The government is attempting to improve teaching retention rates as well, but has missed recruitment targets for trainee teachers for both primary and secondary schools for the ninth time in 10 years. Another teacher, Sam Alner, shares the difficulties of the job and the importance of work-life balance, which leads to many leaving the profession. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, which has restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrates how tellurium nanowire implants can be used in a biocompatible device to restore vision and enable the perception of ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advance offers significant promise for treating human blindness. </p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights, emphasizing that travelers need REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The agency humorously addressed the confusion on Facebook, noting that while they appreciate Costco's hotdogs and rotisserie chickens, the membership cards do not meet REAL ID requirements. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, sets standards for identification sources, and all states now issue REAL ID-compliant cards, which typically feature a star marking their compliance. The confusion likely stems from the presence of stars on Costco member cards. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a potential solution to China's demographic challenges. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, prompting authorities to seek effective measures to boost birth rates. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, clashing with rapid economic changes. </p>

          <p>De Kai, a machine learning scientist, proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence (AI) by suggesting that we "parent" these systems as if they were children. He argues that since AI learns by absorbing online content, we need to be conscientious about the information and values we expose them to. This perspective shifts the focus from a technological arms race to a more responsible and ethical development of AI. His book, *Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future*, advocates for treating AI as children that must be parented by good role models. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a new registration system to encourage people to maintain strong connections with rural areas facing depopulation. The initiative aims to enlist over 10 million users in the next decade, providing them with information on local events and services via a smartphone app. The program seeks to revitalize regional areas and reverse the trend of overconcentration in major cities. While the government hopes to attract repeat tourists and those who donate through the hometown tax system, the success of the initiative hinges on providing tangible benefits to registered nonresidents. </p>
