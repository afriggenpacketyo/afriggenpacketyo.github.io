          <p>This article discusses the potential earnings from opening an 18-month certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. Despite recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, 18-month CDs can still offer substantial returns. The article provides examples of potential earnings based on different deposit amounts and interest rates, ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. It also highlights the benefits of an 18-month CD, including protection against market uncertainty and more favorable rates compared to alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article advises homeowners considering a home equity loan to lock in an interest rate in June 2025. It argues that home equity loan rates have stagnated recently, and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates significantly in the near future. Locking in a rate now can protect homeowners from potential rate increases and is still cheaper than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards. The article emphasizes the benefit of a fixed rate in an uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is urging Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a strong jobs report. Trump has repeatedly pressured Powell to lower rates, even though markets are not expecting any rate cuts in the near future. The last time the Fed made a single rate cut of a full percentage point was in March 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump's comments come as he maintains that the U.S. economy is "doing great."</p>
