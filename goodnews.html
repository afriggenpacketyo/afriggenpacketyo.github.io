          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Boosts Expectations of US Interest Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell significantly boosted expectations for a US interest rate cut in September during his speech at Jackson Hole, a move long sought by President Trump. Powell suggested that the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs could be temporary and that the "shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance." This more "dovish" stance, indicating an easing of borrowing costs, sent share prices higher as investors welcomed the news. While not directly addressing political pressure, Powell emphasized that policy decisions would be based solely on data and economic outlook, reaffirming the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>US stock markets saw significant gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential interest rate cut during his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all climbed, signaling relief for investors. Powell stated that current risk conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance" and that the Fed would "proceed carefully." Despite previous pressure from President Trump to lower rates, the Fed had held off, monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Traders now place a high likelihood on a September rate cut, reflecting market confidence in Powell's remarks.</p>

          <p>Interpol announced that over 1,200 individuals were arrested in a major cybercrime crackdown across 18 African countries and the United Kingdom, dubbed "Serengeti 2.0." This operation, conducted between June and August, identified approximately 88,000 victims of fraud and illegal cryptocurrency networks, recovering $97.4 million and dismantling over 11,000 malicious infrastructures. Cybercrime now accounts for more than 30% of all reported crime in West and East Africa, highlighting the growing threat. Significant busts included dismantling 25 cryptocurrency mining centers in Angola, recovering $37 million in equipment, and disrupting transnational inheritance scams and online investment frauds that defrauded tens of thousands of victims.</p>

He stated that Congress is "happy to do it" and that a general contractor, Clark Construction, has already been selected for the initiative. The project intends to upgrade streets, address rusting poles, and improve lighting within a three-mile radius of the Capitol and White House, with a goal of completion within 12 months. This announcement was made during a tour of The People's House museum, amidst the administration's ongoing federal anti-crime initiative that has increased law enforcement presence in the capital.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Hints at Potential Interest Rate Cuts Amid Shifting Economic Risks</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that economic conditions might warrant future interest rate cuts, emphasizing the central bank's careful approach amidst high uncertainty. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies are shifting the balance of risks between full employment and stable prices. While the labor market remains resilient, downside dangers are rising, and tariffs pose inflation risks, creating a "challenging situation" for policymakers. Powell reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and independence from political pressure, despite market expectations and calls from President Trump for aggressive cuts.

          <h2>Major Retailers Mitigate Tariff Impact, Consumer Spending Remains Steady Despite Rising Costs</h2>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are largely mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, preventing widespread price hikes for consumers, at least for now. Companies have adopted creative strategies such as diversifying sourcing, pushing costs back to vendors, and importing goods early to absorb increased duties. While some prices have risen, consumer spending has remained resilient overall, though lower-income households show more sensitivity to price changes. Retailers anticipate tariff-related costs will continue through the fiscal year, but strong brand loyalty and lucrative new revenue streams, like advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping larger companies weather the economic uncertainty.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described a "challenging situation" for the central bank, balancing a hiring slowdown with tariff-driven price increases that affect both employment and inflation. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell acknowledged the "clearly visible" effects of tariffs on consumer prices and their expected accumulation, but also noted the "shifting balance of risks" due to a weak jobs report. He hinted at possible interest rate adjustments, stating conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance." Market futures reacted positively, indicating a high probability of a September rate cut, despite ongoing political pressure from President Trump for lower rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are providing five key strategies to help retirees maximize their income and manage elevated living costs, which are impacting fixed incomes and savings. Recommendations include delaying Social Security benefits until after age 70 for significantly higher monthly payments, and downsizing or relocating to areas with lower costs of living to reduce housing expenses. Utilizing annuities or reverse mortgages for guaranteed income streams is also suggested, though with awareness of their trade-offs. Other advice involves taking advantage of catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for those over 50 and exploring part-time work. Additionally, reviewing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies, such as Roth conversions, can further improve a retiree's financial bottom line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation to begin testing self-driving cars in New York City. This marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with Waymo initially deploying up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. New York state law mandates a human driver behind the wheel for these operations, with Waymo required to report data and collaborate with emergency services. Mayor Eric Adams welcomed the move as a step towards a tech-friendly future, and Waymo plans further expansion nationwide, having already surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips in May and eyeing other major US cities.</p>

This move, leveraging an advanced FP8 precision format, signals DeepSeek's intent to collaborate more closely with China's domestic AI chip ecosystem, especially as Beijing reportedly urges the use of domestic alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs. The development comes amidst Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and China's push for chip self-sufficiency. DeepSeek has previously demonstrated strong AI model capabilities despite these restrictions, suggesting China is making significant progress in building its own advanced AI hardware infrastructure.</p>
