          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed Malta's 'golden passport' program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere 'commercial transaction' that undermines the solidarity and trust between member states. The ruling mandates Malta to cease offering citizenship in exchange for investments, although the country's Prime Minister Robert Abela stated that they will rework the system to comply with the court's decision. While purchased passports are now prohibited, 'golden visas,' which offer residency permits for significant investments, remain a viable option for entering the Schengen zone, raising concerns about potential security and money laundering risks.</p>

While the opposition supports allowing separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, citing concerns about traditional family values. The survey estimates that over a million people in common-law relationships would marry if separate surnames were permitted.</p>

          <p>A South Texas community, largely composed of SpaceX employees, has voted to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling Elon Musk's long-term vision. The vote, with overwhelming support, marks a significant step in solidifying the community's identity and governance. As a municipality, Starbase will be eligible for state and federal grants, can establish its own police and fire departments, and can enact local ordinances. The community covers about 1.5 square miles and has served as the hub of SpaceX's rocket launch operations.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a Japanese hot spring town famed for its Taisho-era architecture and likened to the setting of "Spirited Away," is limiting visitors due to overtourism. The town, struggling with crowds and congestion, implemented admission restrictions for day-trippers, requiring shuttle buses and advance tickets. These measures, while generally supported, revealed loopholes, prompting further adjustments. The goal is to preserve the town's serene atmosphere and cultural heritage amid a surge in foreign tourists.</p>
