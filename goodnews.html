          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is adopting a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The team is implementing a "virtual athletes' village" where swimmers live and train together to build resilience and teamwork in unfamiliar, challenging environments. This approach was trialed ahead of the world championships, with athletes staying in shared accommodations and commuting to the venue, simulating Olympic conditions. Officials and athletes reported positive outcomes, noting that the experience helped them perform well under stress and fostered a stronger sense of team spirit and motivation.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children about sun safety to help reduce future rates of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates children as young as five on how to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life, and with melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is crucial. The program aims to empower children to take responsibility for their own sun protection, a measure supported by dermatologists and cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, which had a 98 percent success rate over its career, is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This final mission was celebrated by spectators and officials, who praised the H2A's long and reliable service in advancing Japan's aerospace exploration capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights in defiance of a government ban. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government had attempted to prohibit the march, citing a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled the event to proceed by classifying it as a council-organized gathering, which is exempt from the assembly law. The massive turnout was seen as a clear rebuke to Orban's policies, with many participants motivated to attend specifically because of the attempted ban.</p>

A notable example was a doubleheader in May that drew over 26,000 fans, setting a new crowd record for a domestic women's league match.

          <p>In his third pitching start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered his best performance yet, though the Dodgers ultimately lost to the Kansas City Royals. Pitching two scoreless innings, Ohtani showcased dominant velocity, including a fastball that reached 101.7 mph, the fastest of his MLB career. His workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, but he effectively attacked the strike zone and kept hitters off balance. Despite his strong start, the Dodgers' bulk reliever struggled and the offense failed to capitalize, but Ohtani's outing was a significant positive step, demonstrating his potential as an impact pitcher for the team.</p>

Speaking at an economic summit, Shum stated that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chip production, China's progress in algorithm engineering is significant. He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek as an example, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. models using far fewer AI chips.
