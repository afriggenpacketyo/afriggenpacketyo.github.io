          <p>Following a record-breaking summer of recruitment, defending Premier League champions Liverpool are poised to face stiff competition from other top clubs that have also invested heavily in new talent. Arsenal has spent over £190 million on players like Viktor Gyokeres, signaling a strong intent to secure their first trophy since 2020. Manchester City, aiming to rebound from a trophy-less season, has refreshed its squad with five new signings to re-energize their campaign. Meanwhile, Chelsea has added significant talent to its billion-pound roster, and Newcastle United looks to build on last season's momentum, though their transfer window has been less transformative than their rivals.</p>

          <p>A UK newspaper roundup highlights several key stories, including the resignation of homelessness minister Rushanara Ali following controversy over rent increases on a property she owns. In health news, a new daily obesity pill, orforglipron, could be available on the NHS next year after trials showed it helped patients lose significant body weight. Additionally, new guidance is reportedly being prepared for ministers that would direct public facilities like schools and hospitals to ban transgender women from using single-sex spaces. In scientific developments, researchers are studying the apple snail's ability to regrow its eyes, hoping it could lead to future cures for blindness in humans.</p>

          <p>Shares for Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record, marking the company's best single-day performance in five years. The jump followed the announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and marking a second consecutive profitable quarter. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021, with notable contributions from investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of SoftBank's portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also anticipated to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy nationwide since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified a class action on behalf of all children who would be affected, stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration argues the amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to parents who are not citizens or permanent residents.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm over her wrongful termination lawsuit after being fired from the Star Wars series "The Mandalorian" in 2021. Carano, who played Cara Dune, was dismissed following controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The lawsuit, which sought $75,000 in damages and reinstatement, was financially supported by Elon Musk. In a statement following the undisclosed settlement, Lucasfilm praised Carano's professionalism and said it looks forward to potential future work opportunities, while Carano expressed hope the resolution brings healing.</p>

          <p>A species of butterfly native to Southern Europe, the Southern Small White, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, with its identity confirmed by experts. The species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant ecological event, conservationists note that its long-term establishment in the UK is uncertain, as its primary food source, the Candytuft plant, is not widely grown there.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features luxurious amenities including eight staterooms, a glass elevator, a mosaic pool, and a helideck. The yacht was seized in Fiji in 2022 as part of U.S. efforts to pressure allies of Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. Justice Department maintains the ship was owned by oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, though another non-sanctioned Russian figure claims ownership. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit to participate.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are experiencing fatigue with dating apps and are turning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find love. Organizers of events like Date Cincy report a rising demand for face-to-face interactions, as many feel online profiles can be misleading and lack genuine chemistry. This trend is reflected in market data, with dating app Bumble's value plummeting and event platforms like Eventbrite seeing a 42% increase in attendance at singles events. Couples who have met at these gatherings say the direct, personal connection offers a more authentic foundation for a relationship than swiping on a screen.</p>
