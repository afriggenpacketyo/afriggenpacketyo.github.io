          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by researchers at the Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that cats use their sense of smell to differentiate between their owners and strangers. The study found that cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers compared to those from their owners, and favored their right nostrils when sniffing stranger scents. Additionally, a cat's personality traits, quantified using the Feline Five test, influenced how they interacted with the odors, with more "neurotic" male cats repeatedly returning to the smell tubes. While the study suggests smell is a tool for recognizing humans, it does not conclude it is the most important mechanism.</p>

          <p>Mars, the maker of Skittles, has phased out the use of titanium dioxide in its US Skittles portfolio, a color additive banned in the European Union in 2022 due to potential health risks. The decision follows years of criticism and comes amid heightened concerns about processed foods, particularly with Robert F Kennedy Jr. leading the Department of Health and Human Services. Mars had previously committed to removing all artificial colors from its foods by 2016, citing evolving consumer preferences. The company has not commented on whether consumers will notice any difference in the product.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, stating that cryptocurrency has a champion and ally in the White House with President Trump. The Trump administration aims to ease regulations, promote growth, and mainstream the cryptocurrency industry. Vance, a long-standing supporter of cryptocurrencies, urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. He emphasized that crypto acts as a hedge against bad policymaking and inflation, but cautioned the industry to remain politically engaged to influence policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising recent college graduates to prioritize saving for retirement, emphasizing the benefits of compound interest and long-term market participation. Despite potential budget constraints, setting up a routine of investing early is key to long-term financial stability. Experts recommend investing as much as possible in low-cost index funds, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that track broad market indexes. While short-term market volatility may be a concern, the emphasis is on "time in the market" rather than "timing the market," making it easier to accumulate wealth over time.

He cited the European Union as an example, stating that they agreed to meet after he announced a 50% tariff. Trump characterized his approach as negotiation, rejecting the suggestion that it constituted backing down.</p>
