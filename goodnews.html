          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, dominated the fight as Chavez Jr., 39, was largely defensive and inactive, throwing few punches throughout the contest. The judges scored the fight 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92 in favor of Paul, who has now won 12 professional fights. The victory continues to raise questions about the quality of Paul's opponents, as Chavez Jr. appeared far from his prime championship form.</p>

          <p>The French government is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment into satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink broadband service. This move positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty, especially after its 2023 merger with British venture OneWeb. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing significant disparities in scale, with Eutelsat operating 650 satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. The company is expected to focus on sovereign, security, and enterprise markets rather than mass-market consumer broadband. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance model, on-the-ground observations suggest that both Beijing and Taipei face significant limitations in their ability to influence the island's identity and daily life. The island's 130,000 residents navigate a reality shaped by their proximity to the mainland and their political ties to Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The liquid-fuel rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a cornerstone of Japan's space development efforts. The H2A series is now being retired and replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket. The new H3 model is designed to be more cost-effective, offering a lower price for launch services to maintain Japan's competitiveness in the global space industry.</p>
