        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses the issue of scrupulosity, an obsessive concern with one's own morality that can lead to paralysis and guilt. The author suggests that striving for moral perfection, or to do 'The Most Possible Good,' is an unrealistic standard for humans, unlike angels in rabbinic tales. Instead, a more compassionate approach is to view moral shortcomings as 'missing the mark' rather than unforgivable sins, a perspective supported by psychological research showing self-compassion fosters greater accountability. The article encourages embracing human imperfection as a path to more effective and sustainable ethical living.</p>

          <p>Writers and editors from The Atlantic have compiled a list of five nonfiction books that possess the narrative drive and engaging characters typically found in fiction. The recommendations include Patricia Lockwood's humorous memoir 'Priestdaddy' and Patrick Radden Keefe's 'Say Nothing,' a propulsive investigation into a murder during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Other selections are Åsne Seierstad's harrowing account of the 2011 Norway attacks in 'One of Us,' Kerry Howley's exploration of data and truth in 'Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs,' and Barbara Demick's 'Eat the Buddha,' which chronicles Tibetan resistance through personal stories.</p>

Crawford's performance is being hailed as a career-defining moment, making him the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be undisputed in three different divisions. In post-fight comments, Crawford expressed that the win was no surprise to him, while Álvarez graciously admitted he could not figure out Crawford's style. Álvarez even stated that Crawford is 'way better than Floyd Mayweather,' cementing the bout's significance in modern boxing history.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued a Yellow wind warning for most of England and all of Wales as a low-pressure system from the Atlantic is set to bring severe weather. The warning, effective from Sunday evening to Monday evening, anticipates inland gusts of 45-55 mph, with coastal areas potentially experiencing winds up to 70 mph. In addition to the strong winds, which could cause travel disruption and power cuts, heavy rain is also expected.

          <p>Researchers from Swansea University have successfully recorded the first-ever footage of the rare and threatened sliteye shark in the Chagos Archipelago, a protected marine area in the Indian Ocean. The discovery was made using underwater cameras in deepwater seagrass beds, providing new insights into the habitat of this elusive species. The presence of the shark in this protected zone highlights the critical role such areas play in conserving vulnerable marine life. This finding is seen as a positive development for ocean biodiversity and underscores the importance of safeguarding lesser-known but vital ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cyberport, a government-run tech incubator in Hong Kong, is considering the use of Chinese-made graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is aimed at reducing reliance on chips from the American company Nvidia, especially amidst escalating US-China trade tensions. The center's CEO stated that they are currently testing GPUs from four different mainland Chinese manufacturers to evaluate their performance and cost-effectiveness. This strategic shift reflects a broader effort to build a more resilient and independent tech supply chain in the face of geopolitical uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically found in continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the UK for the first time. Scientists in the New Forest region found the insects in moth traps, confirming their migration across the English Channel, likely aided by recent hot weather. This discovery is part of a broader trend of winged insects, including various moths and butterflies, colonizing southern England as a result of warming temperatures. Experts suggest that providing suitable habitats for these naturally colonizing species is a positive step for maintaining biodiversity in a changing climate.</p>

          <p>A major drug trafficking empire in Newport, Wales, was dismantled after police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone. The chats led investigators to Robert Andrews Jr., a 34-year-old who maintained the facade of an ordinary working father while masterminding a large-scale cocaine and heroin operation. A covert surveillance operation subsequently captured Andrews Jr. conducting brazen drug deals and exchanging bags containing over £100,000 in cash. He was sentenced to over 14 years in prison, with several associates also receiving significant jail time.</p>
