          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, signaling a significant thaw in trade tensions. This agreement, reached after high-stakes talks in Switzerland, will cut 'reciprocal' tariffs from 125% to 10% for a 90-day period starting Wednesday. The U.S.' 20% duties on Chinese imports related to fentanyl will remain in place, resulting in total tariffs on China standing at 30%. Both countries will continue discussions on economic and trade policy during this pause, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressing optimism about the venue and the positive process.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK has unveiled its plans to cut immigration levels, proposing a mix of tightened and loosened visa requirements. Skilled worker visas will require higher qualifications, while eligibility for the 'high potential individual' visa will expand. Immigrants will need to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for permanent residency, with a faster route for high-skilled workers. A dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and overseas graduates will have a shorter post-study stay. The government aims to reduce net migration without setting an overall cap, focusing on a 'controlled, selective, and fair' system.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Stars secured a 5-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, taking a 2-1 series lead.

          <p>The spring sales of modern and contemporary art in New York are approaching, but without the high-flying estimates of previous years, reflecting economic uncertainty and new challenges like tariffs. Auction houses are betting on themselves to raise substantial money, but the market remains soft with fewer ultrawealthy collectors. Key artworks from Giacometti, Mondrian, and de Amaral will serve as bellwethers for the market's health. The auction houses are facing layoffs and a decline in sales, making this season a crucial test of the art market's resilience.</p>

          <p>Two studies on wild chimpanzees reveal that their communication includes rhythmic structures and call combinations, key elements of spoken language. Chimpanzees use drumming to communicate over long distances, with different populations using different rhythmic structures. They also combine distinct calls to create new meanings, such as combining 'hoo' and 'pant' calls to indicate nest-building. These findings support research on other primates and suggest that rhythmic structures and call combinations were present before the appearance of the first humans, highlighting the potential for shared motivations like gossip in primate communication.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that Congress should modify the tax code to help victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires rebuild their communities more quickly. Proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and the sale of their lots, and allowing deferral of income taxes on the sale of a principal residence if the proceeds are used to buy or build a new home in the fire areas. These changes aim to counteract current tax laws that incentivize fire victims to hold onto their damaged properties, slowing down the rebuilding process.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily slash tariffs to reduce global trade tensions. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement is a temporary reprieve but repercussions will linger. This action comes after Trump announced a barrage of tariffs, creating tension among trading partners and warnings from economists about a potential economic downturn.</p>
