          <h2>Japanese Public Expects Rice Prices to Decrease Under New Farm Minister</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in the country's soaring rice prices with the appointment of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also revealed that 44.7% of respondents believe rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than that pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Additionally, 42.2% felt that the removal of the previous farm minister, Taku Eto, should have occurred sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has slightly increased, while the disapproval rating remains high. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) members, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. During a discussion with young personnel at a Maritime Self-Defense Force command in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to appropriately treating SDF members. This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes new allowances for SDF members, aiming to address a recruitment shortage. Ishiba also addressed recent scandals that have impacted public trust in the SDF and reiterated the government's dedication to safeguarding Japan's independence and peace, citing concerns about China's maritime assertiveness, North Korea's missile launches, and Russia's actions in Ukraine. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government has described this move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improving services and investing in infrastructure, though stopping short of promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing staffing for security and cleaning, while the Conservatives are calling on Labour to deliver on their promises. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized the importance of providing good value for money to customers, acknowledging that the taxpayer subsidizes the trains by ¬£2 billion annually. The new service features the Great British Railways (GBR) livery, signaling the integration of SWR into the nationalized system. </p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham is urging the public to remain calm after the West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. Although the UK Health Security Agency found fragments of the virus in Retford, Nottinghamshire, Professor Jonathan Ball believes climate change will likely increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases. He notes that while two in ten people infected may show mild symptoms, only one in 150 will experience severe disease. Surveillance will increase in Gamston, Retford, to monitor mosquito activity, and Professor Ball advises avoiding mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide. </p>

Despite overwhelming evidence against the perpetrators, Michelle was treated as a suspect during the trial, with the defense attacking her character and finances.

          <p>In this guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," and how it serves as a distraction from the anxieties of the real world. She explains that focusing on a fictional apocalypse helps her cope with the kind-of-sort-of-possibly apocalyptic things that are really taking place in 2025. She recounts how watching horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage and acknowledges that she remains weak, unable to find solace in lighter genres. She humorously describes her attempts to engage others in her zombie obsession and her husband's unhelpful, scientific response to her anxieties. </p>
