          <h2>Trump Announces Over $90 Billion in Private Energy and AI Investments for Pennsylvania</h2>

          <p>Former President Trump, alongside tech and energy leaders, revealed over $90 billion in private investments for Pennsylvania at a summit in Pittsburgh. The initiative aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy by building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for workforce training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted projects like Westinghouse's plan for ten new nuclear reactors, framing the investment as a historic move to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers in the state, though it was met with some protests regarding environmental and ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that within a decade, the world's factories will be predominantly operated by robots and artificial intelligence. Speaking at an expo in Beijing, he stated that automation and machine learning are set to replace humans in many manufacturing roles, particularly those that are repetitive or hazardous. Huang emphasized that AI is becoming a fundamental infrastructure, comparable to electricity or the internet, and is already revolutionizing supply chains. He also praised the progress of Chinese tech firms in leveraging AI, highlighting platforms like WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin as iconic examples of its application.</p>

          <h2>Trump to Establish National Standards for College Athlete Compensation via Executive Order</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 23:07:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order creating national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move addresses the complex system of state laws that currently govern how college athletes can be compensated for endorsements, appearances, and other activities. The action follows a House subcommittee's advancement of the SCORE Act, a bill aiming to federalize NIL regulations, though concerns exist about its potential to grant excessive power to the NCAA. The landscape of college athletics has been dramatically altered since 2021 rules allowed student-athletes to earn significant income, a shift from decades of NCAA restrictions on player compensation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the United States. In exchange, he stated that the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant shift in the trade relationship. As part of the deal, Trump claimed Indonesia committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. The announcement, which follows direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, has not yet been formally confirmed by Jakarta. This approach mirrors recent trade negotiations with other nations where the U.S. has dictated new tariff terms.</p>

          <h2>Trump Persuades House GOP Holdouts to Advance Cryptocurrency Legislation</h2>

          <p>After a key procedural vote failed, President Trump held a White House meeting with Republican holdouts to secure their support for a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, had been unexpectedly blocked when thirteen Republicans voted with Democrats against advancing it. Following the discussion, Trump announced that the necessary members had agreed to reverse their position, allowing the bills to move forward. This quick turnaround highlights the president's significant influence over the House Republican conference and his administration's push to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is part of a broader "Crypto Week" initiative by House Republicans to support the digital currency industry. Stablecoins are designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, making them potentially suitable for faster and lower-cost financial transactions. If passed, the act would create clear rules and consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins and integrate them into mainstream services.</p>

          <p>On the opening day of a major supply chain expo, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to globalization and free trade. In a published article, he spoke out against the rise of unilateralism, protectionism, and trade barriers that challenge the global economic order. Xi stated that China opposes the building of walls and the use of unilateral sanctions, positioning his nation as a champion of an open and inclusive global economy. The statements come as China continues to contrast its economic policies with the more protectionist stances adopted by the United States under President Trump.</p>

          <p>An article in China's People's Daily newspaper has urged local governments to utilize their legislative powers as a tool to stimulate economic and social development. Since 2015, hundreds of Chinese cities have been granted the authority to draft local laws on issues concerning urban development, environmental protection, and heritage preservation. The state media outlet highlighted that tailored local legislation creates a stable and predictable legal framework, which is crucial for market entities to operate effectively. The piece suggests that this shift from relying on top-down directives to rule-of-law governance has been instrumental in addressing local economic challenges over the past decade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows nations like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving their foreign exchange holdings. The approach is also cheaper, as it avoids intermediary fees and allows for purchases at a slight discount to international prices. This trend reflects a broader global move by central banks to increase their gold reserves as a hedge against geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having a cast that made firing a gun unlikely and multiple witnesses placing him at a family party. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts by the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, clearing his record and paving the way for the civil settlement.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will address the toll that the hot, humid internal climate has taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps, significantly reducing its carbon footprint while preserving its Victorian aesthetic.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who was executed for assassinating authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim, who shot Park during a dinner, was convicted of insurrection and attempting to seize power, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests and restore democracy. The case is being revisited 46 years later after the court accepted that Kim was tortured during the initial investigation under a military regime. The retrial forces a national re-examination of a pivotal moment in the country's history and the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>
