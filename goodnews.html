          <p>The Department of War has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation intended to cover the salaries of U.S. service members affected by the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump announced that a "friend" of his made the contribution to offset the impacts of what he termed the "Democrat shutdown." However, legal experts note that Congress must still appropriate the funds for military pay, as federal law restricts how the government can use private donations for employee salaries, potentially creating a roadblock for distributing the money.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ordered the permanent closure of S&W Atlas Iron & Metal, a scrap yard that operated next to a Watts high school for decades. The company and its owners must pay $2 million in penalties, including $1 million in restitution to the school district, for endangering students with explosions, shrapnel, and toxic dust. This sentencing resolves multiple criminal charges related to hazardous waste handling and follows a long history of dangerous incidents, including a fiery explosion on the first day of school.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index indicated a 3% annual inflation rate for September, a figure slightly below economists' predictions but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data was released despite the ongoing government shutdown to facilitate the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment calculation. Economists note that while President Trump's tariffs are contributing to upward price pressure, the impact on consumers has been partially blunted by businesses absorbing some costs. The benign report is expected to support another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers like Kohl's are starting their holiday marketing campaigns and sales events earlier than usual to capture spending from increasingly cautious shoppers. Executives report that consumers, particularly those with lower incomes, are feeling budget constraints and are more strategic, often waiting for major discount events to make purchases. In response, stores are adjusting their promotional strategies, emphasizing private brands, and anticipating that shoppers will make more frequent trips with smaller basket sizes throughout the holiday season.
