          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. Its stock value increased by more than 4% on Monday, placing it in an exclusive club alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The recent surge in share price was partly fueled by a favorable antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties on the company. Despite facing increased competition in the AI space and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's stock has risen over 30% this year, reflecting strong investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has made a remarkable comeback, rising 3.6% on Monday to turn positive for the year after a difficult first quarter. The shares have soared 85% from their low point in early April, buoyed by factors including a recent $1 billion stock purchase by CEO Elon Musk. Despite the rally, the company still faces challenges from an aging electric vehicle lineup, increased competition, and some consumer backlash related to Musk's political activities. The company is attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.</p>

The positive data supports the company's plan to seek FDA approval in the first quarter of next year. The stock broke out of a cup base, a technical pattern watched by traders.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, many are considering how to tap into this financial resource. The article explores several primary methods for borrowing a significant sum like $50,000. Options include a home equity loan, which offers a fixed rate and predictable payments, or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which provides a flexible, revolving credit line. Other methods are a cash-out refinance, which replaces an existing mortgage with a larger one, and a reverse mortgage for seniors over 62. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Trump Administration Illegally Fired Thousands of Probationary Workers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management (OPM) acted illegally by directing the mass firing of over 25,000 probationary federal employees. U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that the OPM overstepped its authority, as the power to hire and fire rests with individual agencies, not a central office. While the judge determined too much time has passed to reinstate the workers, he ordered most agencies to update the employees' personnel files. The letters must clarify they were not terminated for poor performance, correcting the administration's justification for the firings.</p>

          <p>Eligible Facebook users who filed a claim are beginning to receive payments from the company's $725 million privacy settlement. The class-action lawsuit stemmed from allegations that Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, most notably in the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Approved claimants will receive an email notification, with payments being distributed over the next ten weeks via methods like PayPal or direct deposit. The average payment is expected to be around $29, with the amount varying based on how long the user maintained an active Facebook account.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that Washington and Beijing have agreed to a "framework" deal regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The agreement, set to be finalized by Presidents Trump and Xi, aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell or face a ban. While details remain sparse, the deal reportedly paves the way for U.S. ownership, though China has stated it will not approve any deal at the expense of its companies' interests. Skeptics question whether the framework will fully address issues like data security and control of the app's algorithm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to lower interest rates, savers are encouraged to strategically place their funds to maximize returns before rates fall further. For a sum like $10,000, moving money out of traditional low-yield savings accounts is recommended. Experts suggest considering a certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in a currently high fixed rate, or a high-yield savings account which still offers competitive, albeit variable, rates with greater liquidity. A money market account is another option, providing high rates along with check-writing capabilities, blending savings and banking features. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which recently fell to their lowest point in nearly a year, could drop further this week as the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark rate. Lenders often reduce their rates in anticipation of Fed action, meaning potential homebuyers may already be seeing more favorable offers. While a rate cut seems certain, its size remains a question, with a larger cut potentially leading to a more significant drop in mortgage costs. Experts advise that these lower rates are not guaranteed to last, urging prospective buyers to monitor the market closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewables Remain Most Cost-Effective Energy Source Despite Policy Shifts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. While the Trump administration has enacted policies favoring fossil fuels and imposing tariffs that raise costs for some renewable components, the fundamental economics still favor renewables due to low operating expenses. Experts note that fossil fuels like natural gas are more expensive to generate but are currently essential for providing reliable backup power. A diverse mix of energy sources is considered necessary to meet rising electricity demands.</p>
