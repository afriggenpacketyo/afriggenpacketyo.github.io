          <p>Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase belonging to his late father, revealing a past as Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, born into one of Berlin's wealthiest Jewish families. The contents led Antony on a decade-long quest to uncover a fortune and artworks stolen under Nazi rule, including a vast steel business owned by his great-grandfather. The article details how the family was dispossessed through a "forced sale" to a non-Jewish associate before fleeing Germany in 1938, narrowly escaping the Holocaust that claimed most relatives. Efforts for restitution have seen some success, with the Brohan Museum returning a painting, emphasizing the human story behind the lost assets.</p>

          <p>Chen-ning Yang, the esteemed Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. Often ranked among the 20th century's most brilliant physicists, Yang was celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to the field. In 1954, he co-authored the Yang-Mills theory with Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved fundamental to understanding three of nature's four forces: electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. This pivotal work laid the mathematical bedrock for the Standard Model, which remains the cornerstone of modern physics, unifying forces and explaining elementary particle behavior.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have experienced a substantial surge in the South African SUV market, growing their sales volume by 86% between January and August compared to the previous year. This impressive growth has boosted their total market share to 15%, primarily driven by strong performances from brands like Chery and Haval. Chery's volume rose 27% to over 16,000 units, while Haval saw a 45% increase to more than 12,000 units. Consequently, the long-standing dominance of Japanese leaders Toyota and Suzuki is waning, as both brands recorded a decline in market share during the same period.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an unprecedented two-way masterpiece, hitting three home runs and pitching into the seventh inning with ten strikeouts, as the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series. Ohtani's historic performance included becoming the first pitcher to hit a leadoff homer in MLB history and the 12th player to hit three playoff homers in a game. This dominant display secured the Dodgers' back-to-back pennants, marking their fifth World Series appearance in nine seasons.

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a new computing pooling solution that reportedly slashed the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required for its artificial intelligence models by 82%. Beta-tested in Alibaba Cloud’s model marketplace, Aegaeon reduced GPU needs from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models, demonstrating significant resource efficiency. This innovation addresses the inefficiency of serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are underutilized for less popular models. The system, detailed in a research paper, positions Alibaba Cloud as a leader in optimizing AI infrastructure costs and resource allocation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively developing an ecosystem to reinforce its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center, introducing new schemes to facilitate easier and cheaper yuan borrowing. One such initiative, the RBF, allows mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investments and foreign firms to obtain yuan funding for mainland expansion, expanding in December. This strategic move aims to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency, with Hong Kong dollar interest rates currently more than double those of mainland yuan loan rates.

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This move aims to protect U.S. companies and incentivize domestic manufacturing by making foreign competitors less cost-competitive. The administration will also offer a credit to manufacturers importing parts for U.S.-based vehicle production, offsetting tariff liabilities. This policy is designed to encourage American labor and expand domestic production, ensuring all drivers contribute their "fair share" to road maintenance, though no decisions on specific fuel duties have been made yet.

Often compared to 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's distinguished career began at 13 when he joined the Red Army and participated in the Long March. His transfer to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952 marked a pivotal moment, despite never having seen the sea before.

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering a spectacular display of bright, fast-moving meteors visible until November 7, with the best viewing between midnight and dawn around October 22. These meteors, originating from debris left by Halley's Comet, travel at approximately 41 miles per second, creating distinctive light trails. Stargazers are advised to find a dark location away from city lights and allow their eyes to adjust to the dark for optimal viewing towards the constellation of Orion. The shower is expected to produce around 15 meteors per hour during its peak, visible to the naked eye.</p>

The article highlights a clear trend: investment demand, particularly for bars, coins, ETFs, and digital gold, is steadily rising, accounting for 35% of demand compared to 19% last year.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a remarkable turnaround in its drug death epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives, largely due to harm reduction strategies. States like North Carolina, with a 35% decrease, are at the forefront, implementing programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) that divert substance users to recovery instead of incarceration. The article highlights the critical role of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and widespread naloxone availability in reversing overdoses. While challenges remain, including funding uncertainties and disparities among demographics, a generational shift away from opioids among younger people also contributes to this positive trend.</p>
