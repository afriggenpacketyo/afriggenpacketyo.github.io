          <p>Cliff Asness's quantitative investment firm, AQR Capital Management, has reported strong performance in the first half of 2025, with several key funds outperforming the market. The firm's $4.3 billion Apex strategy, which combines stock, macro, and arbitrage trades, gained 11.4%, while its $4.1 billion Delphi equity fund rose 11.6%. These returns significantly exceed the S&P 500's 5.3% gain during the same volatile period.

          <p>According to NYU Stern professor and CEO Suzy Welch, a crucial question can reveal a company's true values during a job interview. Instead of asking about a company's stated values, she advises candidates to ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits more honest and unrehearsed answers, cutting through corporate platitudes to expose the real work culture. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" provide genuine insight into expectations around work-life balance and office dynamics, helping job seekers find a better cultural fit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have decreased, homeowners have a cost-effective way to access funds, but they must be cautious. This article outlines four common mistakes to avoid, including not monitoring the fluctuating rate climate and assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions. Experts also warn against overborrowing, even with lower rates, as the home serves as collateral and is at risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. Finally, homeowners are advised to use HELOCs for strategic purposes, like value-adding home renovations, rather than for discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

This article advises savers on three key steps to take, starting with not allowing the CD to automatically roll over into a new account with a likely lower rate. Experts recommend actively shopping around for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, before anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts further lower them.

          <p>Michael Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, is projected to report a massive paper profit of around $14 billion for the second quarter, driven almost entirely by its vast Bitcoin holdings. This potential gain is a result of a new fair-value accounting rule that allows the company to reflect the market price of its crypto assets in its earnings. The dramatic swing follows a $4.2 billion loss in the first quarter, highlighting the volatility of the company's Bitcoin-centric strategy. While critics point to the stock's inflated premium, the company's shares have surged over 3,300% since it began buying Bitcoin in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study has explored the connection between diet and sleep, finding that certain foods may influence dreams. In a survey of over 1,000 participants, 5.5% reported that food affected their dreams, with dairy products and sweets being most frequently blamed for causing nightmares. The researchers theorize that the link between dairy and bad dreams may be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance, as symptoms like bloating and gas during sleep could negatively impact dream content. While the authors acknowledge potential biases, the findings suggest a plausible connection between digestive health and the nature of our dreams.</p>
