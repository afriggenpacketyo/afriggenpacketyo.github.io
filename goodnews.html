          <h2>New Forensic Methods Using Genetic Genealogy Help Solve Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:45:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, is revolutionizing crime-solving. It highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, who famously identified the Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, from her home. The method, which involves building family trees from public DNA databases, has also been used to solve other cold cases, such as identifying a serial killer and finding the real identity of a kidnapped child. While this powerful tool brings justice to victims, it also raises significant privacy concerns as millions of people upload their genetic data to public sites.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:44:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has introduced significant security upgrades. The agency is now equipped with a fleet of military-grade drones for improved aerial reconnaissance, a direct response to the failure to detect a commercial drone flown by the shooter before the attack. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct and seamless communication with local law enforcement. These changes aim to rectify the communication breakdowns and technological gaps identified during the Butler incident to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Make Electric Vehicles More Affordable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will soon reveal plans to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a £700 million subsidy program, she guaranteed that new measures would reduce the upfront cost of purchasing an EV. The government is also investing £88 million in charging infrastructure, including funds for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The move aims to boost EV adoption, which is currently lagging behind mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>According to financial planners, generating passive income is a crucial strategy for achieving a comfortable retirement, offering more than just reliance on savings. Experts identify three primary advantages: it provides a predictable and steady cash flow, effectively replacing a regular paycheck and reducing reliance on investment withdrawals. This stability helps retirees navigate market volatility without being forced to sell assets at a loss. Furthermore, passive income sources like rental properties or stock dividends often grow over time, providing a valuable hedge against inflation and ensuring long-term financial resilience.

          <p>A 62-year-old CPA, identified as Josh C., is retiring with a net worth over $4.2 million, primarily built through disciplined real estate investing. He advises younger generations to focus on living below their means and consistently investing the difference, a strategy that allowed him to save up to 50% of his income. His approach involved purchasing cash-flowing rental properties in stable, working-class neighborhoods and reinvesting the profits to acquire more properties, which he says accelerated his wealth-building by over a decade. He emphasizes that consistency and time are more important than finding a "perfect" high-return investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a policy adviser in Beijing, argues that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that these institutions should move away from relying on Western academic frameworks and instead focus on empirical research based on China's own practical experiences and policy evolution. According to Zheng, this "self-centred" approach is essential for accurately explaining China's practices to the world and predicting its future trajectory. He believes this focus on domestic reality distinguishes think tanks from universities, which he says can be stuck in outdated Western textbook theories.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in relationships suggests that couples can maintain strong connections during busy weekdays through intentional, small rituals. The happiest couples often build a mini-morning routine, such as cuddling or having coffee together, to start the day connected. They also send thoughtful, non-logistical check-in messages during the day and take a few minutes to de-stress individually after work before reuniting. Prioritizing a short period of daily, distraction-free "us time" and ending the day with a quiet emotional check-in are also key habits that help prevent small issues from escalating and maintain intimacy.</p>

The process, developed at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, uses a system of enzymes for biotransformation, bypassing the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane. This breakthrough offers a potential solution to both environmental and food security challenges by creating a pathway to turn a greenhouse gas into essential food products.
