          <p>The Golden State Warriors' season ended with a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, highlighting their dependence on Stephen Curry. Curry's injury in Game 1 exposed the team's lack of offensive firepower and creativity without him. Despite the midseason acquisition of Jimmy Butler, the Warriors struggled to maintain their scoring efficiency and defensive intensity in Curry's absence. While depth players like Jonathan Kuminga showed promise, the Warriors' over-reliance on Curry raises concerns about their long-term competitiveness and the need for additional offensive talent.</p>

          <p>A new term called "dry texting" is used by teenagers to subtly express disapproval or signal a change in the conversation's vibe, according to teens. Leaving someone on read, half-swiping on Snapchat, or turning off location sharing are all ambiguous signals that can cause anxiety and confusion. These behaviors, while not unique to teens, are amplified by their deep integration with technology. The reliance on these subtle cues can hinder the development of conflict resolution skills, as teens may avoid direct confrontation in favor of passive-aggressive communication.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether federal judges can issue nationwide injunctions, a practice that has allowed single judges to block Trump administration policies across the country. The Trump administration argues that these injunctions hinder its ability to implement its agenda, while opponents contend that they are necessary to protect constitutional rights. A ruling limiting nationwide injunctions could significantly reshape how federal courts handle challenges to presidential policies, potentially curbing the power of the judicial branch and boosting executive authority. The outcome of the case could have major implications for the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

She is now encouraging other women who may have been affected by similar convictions to apply for pardons to uncover any unknown criminal records.
