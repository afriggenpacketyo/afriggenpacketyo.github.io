          <p>Chipmaker Broadcom reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, largely due to a significant increase in its artificial intelligence-related business. The company's AI revenue grew by 63% to $5.2 billion, and it provided a strong sales forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting continued growth. This performance reflects high demand for its custom AI chips and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom's stock has seen substantial gains over the past year as investors view it as a key player in the expanding AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Saints' social media team responded to comments made by ESPN analyst Ryan Clark, who stated that legendary quarterbacks like Drew Brees, Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning were not "generational talents." Clark made the distinction while discussing rising star Arch Manning, suggesting that players like John Elway and Patrick Mahomes fit the description better. In response, the Saints posted screenshots of NFL records showing Brees, Brady, and Manning as the top three all-time leaders in both passing yards and touchdowns, implicitly challenging Clark's assessment of their historical significance.</p>

The report also details how teams contribute 34% of ticket revenue to a shared pool, which is then redistributed to support league operations and stadium financing, highlighting the financial mechanics that underpin the NFL's business model.

          <p>After nearly 25 years, Daniel Levy is stepping down as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, leaving behind a complex and contentious legacy. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably by building a world-class £1 billion stadium and a state-of-the-art training facility. However, his tenure is also defined by a lack of on-field success, with only one major trophy won during his time in charge, leading to frequent fan protests. Levy's legacy will be remembered for its financial and structural achievements, contrasted sharply with the persistent underachievement in securing major silverware.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has released a preliminary list of 68 occupations that may qualify for a new temporary tax break on tip income. This provision, part of a fiscal package signed by President Trump, allows eligible workers earning under $150,000 annually to avoid paying federal income tax on up to $25,000 in tips through 2028. The list includes traditional tipped roles like bartenders and waitstaff, but also extends to jobs such as plumbers, electricians, and social media influencers. The policy is intended to provide financial relief to millions of American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Argentina, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer and her husband have been charged with attempting to conceal an 18th-century painting stolen during World War II. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was taken from Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker and was recently discovered in a real estate listing for the daughter's home. After initially failing to find the artwork in raids, authorities received it from the family, who are now accused of obstruction of justice.
