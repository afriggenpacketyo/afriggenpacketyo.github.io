          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, reaching as high as $109,500. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has increased focus on alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Investors are also anticipating upcoming regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments, which are expected to further drive Bitcoin prices higher. The Senate has voted to advance legislation creating the first regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S., and Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500, marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, has successfully dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide between March 16 and May 16. The Lumma malware, popular among hackers, was used to steal passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft worked with companies like Cloudflare, Bitsight, and Lumen to break down the malware ecosystem, and the U.S. Department of Justice took control of Lumma's central command structure, suspending locally based infrastructure with the help of cybercrime control centers in Japan. The article notes that the malware was easy to spread and circumvent security defenses, making it a go-to tool for cybercriminals.</p>

The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, requiring tips to be reported to qualify. While proponents argue it provides relief to hardworking Americans, critics suggest it could lead to issues such as income misclassification and the introduction of tips in new occupations.

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments, following mounting political pressure. The policy change, to be implemented at the autumn Budget, aims to ease cuts that affected over 10 million pensioners. The previous policy restricted eligibility to those qualifying for pension credit, leading to criticism. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the "inevitable" U-turn, calling for details to be set out early, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for the cuts to be reversed "in full." The article notes the challenges in designing a new eligibility threshold.</p>
