          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is scheduled to have his Senate confirmation hearing next week. Waltz previously served as Trump's national security adviser, a position he left after coming under fire for his involvement in a security breach on the Signal messaging app. In that incident, sensitive military plans were discussed in a chat that mistakenly included a journalist. Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are expected to question him combatively over the controversy, with some questioning if he is qualified for the high-profile diplomatic post.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has fueled speculation that she has split from NFL star Stefon Diggs after she removed all photos featuring him from her Instagram page. The couple, who had been seen together since February, made their relationship official in June with a series of intimate photos that are now gone. While neither of their representatives has commented, fans noted the change as Cardi B arrived at Paris Fashion Week without Diggs. The potential relationship turmoil comes as the Grammy-winning artist prepares to release her highly anticipated sophomore album, "Am I the Drama?," in September.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: New 'Superman' Movie Succeeds by Embracing Sincere, Lighthearted Silliness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:14:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis praises the new "Superman" film for its brilliant and consciously sincere approach, shifting away from the grimness of recent superhero adaptations. Director James Gunn surrounds the hero, played with a "regular-guy sensibility" by David Corenswet, with other super-powered individuals, which helps to define what makes Superman exceptional. The film is described as lighthearted and fun, evoking Saturday-morning cartoons with whimsical concepts and a willingness to be silly. By building modern society's discomfort with pure altruism into the plot, the movie effectively makes the case for the hero's inherent goodness in a refreshing way.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation is designed to protect the financial sustainability of clubs and put fans' interests at the heart of the game, following several high-profile club collapses. The bill was reintroduced by the new Labour government after failing to pass before the last election. During the debate, MPs rejected amendments that would have mandated more free-to-air Premier League matches and scrapped the ban on alcohol in stadium stands.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:11:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between rate security and liquidity. A detailed comparison shows that short-term CDs, such as 3-month or 1-year terms, currently tend to earn slightly more interest than a high-yield savings account with a competitive rate. However, for longer terms like 18 or 24 months, the high-yield savings account could potentially yield more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals and their need for access to the funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany came from behind to defeat Denmark 2-1 in their Euro 2025 group stage match, with striker Lea Schüller once again proving decisive. After Denmark took a first-half lead, Germany equalized through a Sjoeke Nüsken penalty before Schüller scored the winning goal in the 66th minute. This marks the second consecutive game where Schüller has scored a crucial goal for her team. The 27-year-old Bayern Munich star has stepped into a leadership role for Germany following the retirement of Alexandra Popp, and her goal-scoring form will be vital for her country's chances in the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to eliminate the long-standing requirement for most travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints. The rule was implemented in 2006 following intelligence about potential threats and the failed attempt by "shoe bomber" Richard Reid in 2001. The change would bring the screening process for general passengers more in line with the expedited process for those enrolled in TSA PreCheck, who are already allowed to keep their shoes on. The agency has not provided an official timeline for the change but briefed industry members on the plan.</p>

          <h2>French Fencer Cleared of Doping Charges After Claiming Contamination Through Kissing</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport has cleared French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus of doping, accepting her unusual explanation that she was contaminated with a banned substance through kissing. Thibus tested positive for ostarine, but she argued it entered her system via bodily fluids exchanged with her then-partner, who was using a product containing the substance. The court found that scientific evidence supported the possibility of contamination through kissing over a nine-day period. Concluding that Thibus bore no fault or negligence, the court dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban.</p>
