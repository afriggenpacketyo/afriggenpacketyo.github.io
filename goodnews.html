          <p>Australia's national rugby team, the Wallabies, achieved a stunning 38-22 victory against world champions South Africa after trailing 22-0. The match, held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, marked Australia's first win at the venue since 1963. Despite a dominant start from the Springboks, the Wallabies rallied significantly, with captain Harry Wilson scoring two tries in an influential performance. This comeback win provides a strong start for Australia in the Rugby Championship.</p>

Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and affirmed the UK's continued support for Ukraine.

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the reintroduction of standalone physical stores on the High Street, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by Asos, recently hosted its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed push to regain its former cultural relevance. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting younger Gen-Z shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. The company aims to leverage its distinct "London girl" aesthetic and focus on product quality to carve out its market space once again.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter raised concerns over the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and transferred to Russia during the war. This act of personal diplomacy was acknowledged and praised by Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The issue of these abductions is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for his alleged role, and U.S. lawmakers have also condemned the practice.</p>

Major tech and finance companies, including Nvidia, Meta, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock, hit all-time highs during the week's trading.

The move is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" for the family following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. They have been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022 and reportedly view Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home." The relocation is being funded privately, and the couple intends to continue raising their children with a focus on privacy, without live-in staff.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, a startup named Steel + Spark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" shelters, where four containers are joined in an 'X' shape to form units with five individual, air-conditioned rooms each. The design is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and can be constructed in about a week, offering a quick solution to provide private, stable living spaces. The project aims to address the affordable housing crisis, with plans to build a larger apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same method.</p>

At the Silesia Diamond League meet in Poland, Thompson ran a meet-record-tying 9.87 seconds, with Lyles finishing second in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in the Olympic final a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles expressed confidence, viewing the sub-10-second performance as a positive step toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ge Changchun, has called for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology. This technology involves building orbital stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. Ge argued for a top-down national strategy to close the technological gap with the United States, which has been experimenting in the field since the 1970s. The push aims to secure China's position in both the new energy sector and the broader space race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic highlights the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach, advocated by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children rather than controlling every aspect of their lives. While the instinct to solve a child's problems is strong, constant intervention can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The "lighthouse" metaphor suggests providing illumination and safety when needed, but also knowing when to stand back and let children navigate their own path.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he paid for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court order granted the forfeiture after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, an order which Tate did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously forfeited by the Tate brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on their online business revenues. The confiscated funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives in the local community.</p>

Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of the basic items they will need, from bedding and towels to lamps and toolboxes. The program, started in 2018, allows students to select their own dorm decor, giving them a sense of ownership and helping to level the playing field with their peers. This initiative addresses a critical gap in support for a vulnerable population, as only a small percentage of foster youth attain a bachelor's degree.</p>

Her one non-negotiable rule is waking up early when her alarm goes off, which creates personal time before the day's demands begin. Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour flexibly for activities she enjoys, such as reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer walk with her dog. This approach avoids the pressure of a strict routine and allows for creativity and rejuvenation, helping her start the day feeling successful rather than rushed.</p>
