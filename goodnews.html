          <p>After a six-week manhunt, law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, one of the final two inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish jail. Acting on a citizen's tip submitted directly to the sheriff, authorities located Massey in an Airbnb residence in New Orleans, where he surrendered peacefully. Officials noted that Massey likely had assistance to remain a fugitive for so long and are investigating potential accomplices. With Massey in custody and set to face new charges, the search now focuses entirely on the last remaining escapee, Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer.</p>

          <p>Looking ahead to the next trading week, investors are focused on the upcoming labor report and earnings from beverage giant Constellation Brands. The market recently shrugged off news of the U.S. ending trade talks with Canada, finishing a strong quarter that had a tumultuous start due to tariff concerns. A key indicator to watch will be the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands' performance may offer insights into broader consumer trends, including the impact of weight-loss drugs and shifting immigration policies on consumer spending habits.

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants and deportees. The show opened with models dressed in white with their hands bound, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from El Salvador's high-security prisons used to hold some migrants deported from the U.S. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the performance aimed to critique the "dehumanization" of immigrants. The show received largely positive reactions online, with many praising it as a revolutionary use of fashion to highlight social and political injustice.</p>

          <p>A team of technical divers has completed the first-ever human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank in a storm in 1904 with 32 people aboard. The shipwreck was only discovered in 2022 and lies in pitch-black depths of over 500 feet, making the dive exceptionally challenging. The divers had only nine minutes to survey and film the wreck, documenting its crushed bow, smokestacks, and scattered coal cargo. The successful mission provides new information about the century-old maritime disaster, and the team is already planning a future dive to create a more detailed scan of the historic site.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez were married in Venice, Italy, surrounded by a high-profile guest list of celebrities and business leaders. The lavish, multi-day event saw figures like Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates arriving via water taxi for the festivities. This is the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019. The large-scale celebration also drew protests from some local Venetians, who have been campaigning against the impacts of over-tourism and the influx of mega-wealthy events in the historic city.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he believes a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, possibly within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the fighting, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A recent proposal involved a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, though Hamas responded with amendments that were deemed unacceptable. The president's optimistic comments come as the conflict continues, with significant pressure on both sides to reach a deal to end hostilities.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 closed at a new record high, capping a remarkable recovery from the sharp downturn experienced in April following the announcement of new tariffs. Investor confidence has been bolstered by signs of easing global trade tensions and widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. A strong rebound in technology stocks has also been a major driver of the market's turnaround. Despite the renewed optimism, some analysts caution that complacency on trade issues could be dangerous and that markets may still face volatility ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down a presidential executive order that sought to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling the directive unconstitutional. The order was one of several targeting major law firms perceived as political enemies of the administration, aiming to sanction them by restricting access to federal buildings and impacting their clients. The judge ruled that the order against Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News, violated the First and Fifth Amendments. This decision marks another victory for law firms challenging these executive actions, which the judge described as a threat to the independence of the bar.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors consider allocating between 10% to 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous low-single-digit suggestions. He attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto industry, with governments opting for regulation over bans and institutional adoption growing rapidly. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, requiring investments with higher growth potential. He posits that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>
