          <p>According to The New York Times, the United Kingdom is on track to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the United States after the U.S. announced 'reciprocal' tariffs. While the details remain uncertain, the agreement could be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations. The UK, which currently has a trade deficit with the U.S., was subject to a baseline 10% levy but spared from higher tariffs. Vice President JD Vance expressed optimism about securing a beneficial agreement for both nations, though Trump suggested that the U.S. does not need to sign deals with trade partners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is anticipated to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs on trade partners. While specifics are unclear, the agreement may involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm products, and reducing taxes on U.S. technology companies. However, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ruled out reducing food production standards, prioritizing a separate agreement with the EU. A team of British trade negotiators is in Washington to finalize the agreement before a UK-EU summit, with the potential deal reducing tariffs on British exports in exchange for a lower digital services tax.</p>
