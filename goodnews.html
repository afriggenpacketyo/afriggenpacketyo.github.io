          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to the FBI in 1978 by President Carter, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation following a period of scandal and abuse of power. President Reagan later chose him to lead the CIA in 1987, where he worked to improve transparency and relations with Congress after the Iran-Contra affair. Webster was widely respected for his integrity and commitment to the rule of law throughout his long career in public service.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement savings, has released a new book with updated guidance. He now suggests that due to improved portfolio diversification, a withdrawal rate closer to 4.7% is safe, and for today's retirees, a rate of 5.25% to 5.5% might be appropriate. Bengen emphasizes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and that his research indicates most people are too conservative, not spending enough of their accumulated wealth. He advises personalizing withdrawal strategies based on individual circumstances and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major new exhibition is bringing renewed attention to Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her era, even surpassing Rembrandt and Vermeer in fame during her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch developed a unique perspective on nature, which she channeled into intricate and vibrant still-life paintings. The article explores how her work transcended simple decoration, combining scientific precision, aesthetic beauty, and moral commentary. It also notes her remarkable success in a male-dominated field while raising ten children.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops taking down some of the loudspeakers used for broadcasting propaganda across the demilitarized zone. This action is seen as a positive response to diplomatic overtures from South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, who has prioritized improving inter-Korean relations. The move follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers earlier in the week. The propaganda broadcasts, featuring everything from K-pop music to unsettling noises, had been a source of tension and a nuisance for residents living near the border for years.</p>

          <p>American shopping malls, once facing decline, are experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, and community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people to the property weekly. Mall owners like CBL Properties and Brookfield Properties are subdividing large, empty retail spaces for a mix of businesses, including restaurants, bowling alleys, and even hotels. This strategy aims to create a community-focused atmosphere and drive "cross-shopping" between the new, diverse attractions.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, New Jersey teen Logan Coleridge experienced debilitating symptoms for months, including severe headaches and memory loss. When physical therapy and medication failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed a rare and dangerous condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. Neurosurgeons at NYU Langone successfully performed a craniotomy to remove the AVM, which was likely the underlying cause of his long-term symptoms. Logan has since recovered and is preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA analyst who played a pivotal role in unmasking one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has died at the age of 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes was part of a small team investigating why numerous CIA assets in the Soviet Union were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs pointed directly to Aldrich Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations. Her crucial work led to Ames's arrest in 1994, ending a treacherous career of espionage that cost American lives and compromised national security.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, unfairly penalizing it due to competition from Starlink while overlooking the high-growth, high-margin DAT business. The firm believes separating the defense unit from the legacy satellite communications segment could reveal its true worth, estimating a potential valuation for the entire company that is significantly higher than its current share price.

The deal, brokered by the Trump administration, establishes normalized relations and reopens key transportation routes. A significant component is the creation of a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, which will be named the "Trump Route." The agreement marks a major diplomatic achievement for the U.S. and signals Russia's waning influence in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's launch of its new flagship model, GPT-5, has generated a mix of praise and skepticism within China's highly competitive artificial intelligence sector. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted the model as a major step forward with PhD-level expertise, some Chinese tech experts offered a more reserved assessment. One prominent AI blogger described the update as lacking "revolutionary breakthroughs" or memorable new features. The reaction highlights the intense global competition and high expectations in the field of generative AI, where Chinese companies are also rapidly developing their own advanced models.</p>

A new state-owned enterprise has been established with significant capital to oversee the ambitious infrastructure plan. The railway will link the existing line in Tibet with a new route from Hotan in Xinjiang, creating a nearly 2,000-kilometer artery across the high-altitude plateau. This project is part of a broader plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity and national integration.</p>
