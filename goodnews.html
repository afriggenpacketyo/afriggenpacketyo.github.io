          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday as investors awaited the release of the U.S. August jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on a potential interest rate cut in September. The Stoxx 600 index saw gains, led by mining stocks, reflecting a brighter market sentiment after a week of sell-offs. Meanwhile, Danish wind energy company Orsted experienced volatile trading after securing shareholder approval for a major rights issue amidst ongoing legal battles with the Trump administration over offshore wind projects. Market analysts are watching for a jobs report that signals economic softness without indicating a severe downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is asking shareholders to approve a new, large-scale compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, tying his pay to ambitious market capitalization and operational milestones over the next decade. The proposal, which follows a Delaware court's rejection of his 2018 pay package, would grant Musk additional shares in 12 tranches, significantly increasing his voting control over the company. The plan is designed to keep Musk motivated, with the first award contingent on Tesla's market cap nearly doubling to $2 trillion. The company will also ask shareholders to vote on investing in Musk's separate venture, xAI, at its upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a major renovation initiative, updating approximately 1,000 U.S. locations by the end of 2026 to create more welcoming and accessible spaces. The redesigns aim to restore the cafes' status as a "third place" for customers, featuring more seating, cozier aesthetics with dark wood paneling, and inclusive elements like less harsh lighting for those with light sensitivity. This move, part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to boost sales, reverses previous trends of removing seats and outlets. The company is investing around $150,000 per store for these "uplifts," which are designed to be completed without closing the locations.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Solar Flares Are Substantially Hotter Than Previously Believed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that solar flares, the powerful eruptions from the sun's surface, can reach temperatures of up to 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, which is more than six times hotter than prior estimates. A new report explains that previous measurements focused only on the temperature of electrons, assuming that ions would be the same. However, recent simulations and calculations show that ions within the flares heat up significantly more than electrons. This finding could lead to a better understanding of how solar flares work and help improve protections for satellites and astronauts from these dangerous solar events.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender John Stones has been forced to withdraw from the England national team squad ahead of their upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. Manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Stones arrived at the training camp with a muscular issue that has not resolved as hoped. To avoid any risks, the 31-year-old has left the camp and will not participate in the matches. His absence leaves Marc Guehi, Dan Burn, Ezri Konsa, and Jarell Quansah as the remaining centre-back options for the team.</p>

          <h2>French Couple Receives Suspended Sentence for Illegally Keeping Pet Panther</h2>

          <p>A French couple who illegally kept a black panther named Louise in their apartment has been given suspended jail sentences and banned from owning animals. The case gained attention in 2019 when the young panther escaped and was seen roaming the rooftops of a building in northern France, prompting a large-scale rescue operation. The owners claimed they saw the animal as an "affectionate baby," but the court condemned the act as tantamount to species trafficking and mistreatment. The panther, now renamed Akilla, was safely recaptured and currently resides in a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The increase was largely driven by strong sales in clothing, footwear, and online retail, attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. The release of the data was delayed by two weeks due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS apologized. Despite the monthly rise, the broader trend shows a 0.6% decline in sales volumes in the three months leading up to July compared to the previous quarter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new, rigorous clinical study has found that a single high dose of LSD can significantly reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for up to 12 weeks. The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved nearly 200 adults and showed that those who received 100 or 200 micrograms of the substance experienced rapid and sustained improvements compared to those on a placebo or lower doses. The proprietary form of LSD, known as MM120, has been granted "breakthrough therapy" status by the FDA, potentially speeding up its approval process as a revolutionary treatment for psychiatric conditions.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, on September 6, 1995, Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's long-standing record by playing in his 2,131st consecutive baseball game. The moment became iconic not just for the record itself, but for the spontaneous 22-minute victory lap Ripken took around Camden Yards, shaking hands with fans, opponents, and officials. This display of class and connection with the public is credited with helping to revitalize baseball's image and win back fans who were alienated by the 1994 players' strike. The streak, which ultimately reached 2,632 games, cemented Ripken's legacy as baseball's "Iron Man" and a symbol of dedication.</p>

          <h2>New Remote-Controlled 'BurnBot' Tested as a Wildfire Prevention Tool in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new technology called BurnBot, a large remote-controlled vehicle that incinerates flammable vegetation, is being demonstrated as a potential weapon against wildfires in Southern California. The machine, likened to a "Roomba for the forest," can perform highly controlled burns with precision, allowing it to clear flammable brush near homes and highways even during peak fire season with minimal risk. Wildfire officials are observing the technology as an innovative alternative to traditional methods like mowing or prescribed burns, which have limitations. BurnBot aims to reduce human-caused ignitions and create strategic fuel breaks to slow the spread of future fires.</p>
