The Group of Seven (G7) leaders launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, addressing over-dependence on China. Ishiba also highlighted the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japanese firms while China refuted G7 allegations of market-distorting practices. The digest also covers North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russian security official Sergey Shoigu discussing mutual agreements, Japan's commitment to supporting Ukraine, and Japan's trade deficit in May due to weak U.S. exports.

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step towards its lunar ambitions in 2030. The test included a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The Mengzhou spacecraft has two versions: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space lunar missions, and it features a reusable return capsule. The test verified the spacecraft's ability to safely extract astronauts during launch emergencies, marking China's first such test since 1998.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, Japan, marking its first successful landing after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters. The automaker aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies from its existing products and automated driving systems. Honda has not yet decided on commercializing this technology, but recognizes its potential to contribute to daily life through satellite launches compatible with other Honda businesses.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses as high as $100 million and substantial annual compensation packages. While Meta has been aggressively pursuing talent from OpenAI, Altman claims that none of OpenAI's key personnel have accepted the offers. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly frustrated with his company's AI standing and is willing to invest heavily in top AI talent. This effort includes a recent deal where Meta acquired a significant stake in Scale AI, with some of its employees also joining Meta.</p>
