          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States has signed a new agreement with China, though he offered no specific details about its contents. The statement was made during a White House event intended to promote a government spending bill. Trump suggested the deal is a step toward opening up the Chinese market in ways that were previously not possible, crediting his trade and commerce officials for their work. The White House, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the departments of commerce and treasury have not yet provided further information or commented on the nature of the agreement.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a planet outside our solar system, since becoming operational. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be similar in mass to Saturn and orbits a young star named TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, a technique crucial for detecting faint objects like planets. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet, potentially shaping its star's debris disk.</p>

          <p>A California state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top advisor to ex-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. Teran was accused of improperly downloading confidential police discipline records while at the L.A. County Sheriff‚Äôs Department and later using them in her role with the D.A.'s office. The court ruled that her actions were not criminal, as the documents she accessed were publicly available court records. This decision is a significant rebuke to the California Attorney General's office, which brought the politically charged case against her.</p>

          <p>Nike reported a significant 12% drop in sales and an 86% fall in profits for its fiscal fourth quarter, though these figures still beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. The sneaker giant attributed the decline to its ongoing turnaround plan, which involves clearing out old inventory and resetting its digital and wholesale channels. Despite the steep quarterly declines, Nike's finance chief confirmed this period represents the largest financial impact of the restructuring, with headwinds expected to moderate. The company remains focused on winning over female shoppers and is preparing for a delayed but anticipated product launch with Kim Kardashian's Skims line. (not investment advice)</p>

M3GAN's creator, Gemma (Allison Williams), returns, now an anti-technology crusader, adding a layer of hypocritical humor. While the plot revisits familiar themes of AI takeover, the film is praised for its self-aware humor and director Gerard Johnstone's playful style, even as it borrows heavily from action and sci-fi classics.</p>
