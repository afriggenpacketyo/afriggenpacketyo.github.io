          <p>Financial experts offer varying perspectives on gold investment allocations in light of economic uncertainty. Some suggest increasing gold holdings to 20-25% of a portfolio, citing global tensions and inflation, while others recommend maintaining the traditional 10-15% allocation for diversification. Experts generally advise against decreasing gold holdings unless liquidity is urgently needed, but suggest rebalancing to capture gains while prices are high. Key factors to consider include debt levels, inflation trends, currency strength, global instability, and an investor's age and time horizon.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases. While the extent of the agreement remains unknown, economists caution that it would likely generate only a small boost for Britain, which is still vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. The deal could support sectors like Britain's auto industry and lift consumer and business sentiment. However, the United States is an important trading partner, and trade flows are heavily skewed toward services, which were not affected by higher tariffs.</p>

          <p>The House is scheduled to vote on a bill introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America." The bill, which aims to codify an executive order signed by President Trump, faces opposition from some Republicans and Democrats who consider it a waste of taxpayer money. While proponents argue it's appropriate since the U.S. protects the Gulf, opponents deem it juvenile and unnecessary. The White House has restricted Associated Press reporters' access over the news organization's decision to use the original name.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4.25%, the fourth reduction in the past year, citing a slowdown in inflation but cautioning about global economic unpredictability. Governor Andrew Bailey noted the potential impact of US tariffs on the global economy. The decision to cut rates was not unanimous, with some members favoring a larger cut. The rate cut is expected to impact mortgage rates and monthly repayments, providing some relief to homeowners, though most have fixed-rate deals.</p>

The vaccines do not alter DNA and have been proven safe, with no long-term safety signals reported. mRNA technology is being studied for various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disorders, offering hope for treatments where prior technologies have failed.</p>
