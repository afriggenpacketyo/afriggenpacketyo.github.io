The market update noted that overall third-quarter earnings have been solid, though stocks remain sensitive to trade-related news. In other market movements, Texas Roadhouse's stock rating was downgraded due to persistent high beef prices, which continue to pressure the restaurant's profit margins despite a recent rally in its share price.

          <p>With personal bankruptcy inquiries on the rise due to economic pressures, this article explains the income qualifications for filing Chapter 7, which can erase many unsecured debts. Eligibility is determined by a "means test" that compares a person's income to their state's median for a similar household size. If an individual's income is above the median, they are not automatically disqualified but must undergo a more detailed calculation of disposable income after expenses, which may still allow them to qualify for Chapter 7 relief.</p>

          <p>The fitness trend of using weighted vests to enhance workouts can offer benefits like increased calorie burn and improved cardiovascular workload, according to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. However, he advises caution, urging individuals with underlying health conditions to consult a doctor first, as the added weight acts as a mini stress test on the heart. To avoid injury, he recommends starting with a vest that is 5% of one's body weight and ensuring a proper fit to prevent undue stress on joints.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has put forward a proposal to soften its landmark anti-deforestation regulation, which was designed to ban imports of products linked to deforestation, such as coffee, soy, and palm oil. The proposed changes, which still need approval, would move the compliance deadline for large companies to the end of 2025 and remove a requirement for downstream processors to submit deforestation statements. The move comes after facing opposition from major trading partners who argued the original law created excessive administrative burdens and costs.</p>
