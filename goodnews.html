          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced its intention to restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, pending license approvals from the U.S. Commerce Department. This development, which caused AMD's stock to climb over 6%, follows a period of heightened trade tensions and export controls aimed at curbing China's access to advanced technology. The move is part of a broader industry push, with competitor Nvidia also planning to resume sales of its specialized chips to the Chinese market. Chipmakers have previously reported significant revenue impacts due to the U.S. restrictions on AI hardware exports. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining the optimal age to buy an annuity depends heavily on individual financial goals, health, and risk tolerance, rather than a universal rule. While purchasing later in life, such as in one's 70s, typically yields higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations, it isn't always the best strategy. Financial advisors often suggest the 60-70 age range as a balanced window to secure significant income while mitigating market risks. The article explains that different types of annuities, like deferred or immediate, have different ideal purchase timelines, emphasizing the need for a personalized approach to retirement planning.

          <p>Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez has lauded MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, stating he "saved our game" and deserves a place in the Hall of Fame. Rodriguez credited Manfred's rule changes, such as the pitch timer and shift restrictions, for increasing viewership and attendance, thereby revitalizing interest in the sport. This praise is notable given that Manfred oversaw the investigation that led to Rodriguez's full-season suspension in 2014 for performance-enhancing drug use. Despite some controversies, Rodriguez argues that Manfred's positive impact on baseball's popularity and financial health is undeniable.</p>

EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas stated that if Europe pays for the weapons, it is European support, and called for the U.S. to "share the burden" of arming Ukraine.
