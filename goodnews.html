          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 19:52:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on exports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. The agreement is also set to open Japan's markets to American products like cars, trucks, and rice, with the administration claiming it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. This development comes after threats of a higher 25% tariff, leading some economists to view the 15% rate as a relief. The deal addresses a key economic relationship, as automotive exports are a cornerstone of Japan's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final concert performance by the late rock legend Ozzy Osbourne reportedly raised an astounding $190 million for several charitable causes. The event, titled "Back to the Beginning," was held in his hometown of Birmingham, U.K., and featured an all-star lineup of rock and metal acts paying tribute. According to the event's musical director, Tom Morello, the proceeds will be donated to organizations including Cure Parkinson's and children's hospitals.

          <p>Capital One's stock saw an increase following its second-quarter earnings report, as investors showed confidence in the company's long-term strategy involving its recent acquisition of Discover. Despite complex accounting adjustments from the deal that resulted in a reported net loss, the underlying credit trends for Capital One appear strong. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the rare opportunity of becoming one of only two U.S. banks with its own payment network. While integration costs are expected to be higher than initially projected, the company is on track to achieve $2.5 billion in synergies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Amazon founder and Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos at the White House last week, according to sources familiar with the private, hour-long conversation. The meeting signals a notable shift in the relationship between the two, who were frequently at odds during Trump's first term. In recent months, Bezos has reportedly sought to build a closer relationship with the administration as his companies, Blue Origin and Project Kuiper, compete for government contracts, particularly against Elon Musk's SpaceX. The nature of their discussion was not disclosed.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, known as the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), was established by a recently passed bill signed by President Trump. This new income-driven option will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings and a minimum payment of $10. The plan will lead to loan forgiveness after 30 years. Set to be available by July 2026, RAP will become one of only two options for new borrowers, as the legislation also phases out several existing repayment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period.
