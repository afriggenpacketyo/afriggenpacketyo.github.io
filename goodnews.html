          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy economics" with their welfare policy proposals. Badenoch's criticism centers on their approaches to the two-child benefit cap, with both leaders considering its removal. She argues that scrapping the cap would burden taxpayers with funding unlimited child support, claiming the country cannot afford their economic visions and deserves leaders who take economics seriously. Farage has stated his desire to lift the cap to ease the burden on lower-paid workers, while Starmer's government is also considering its removal, acknowledging the significant costs involved.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk will be concluding his official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but hinted at ongoing collaboration. Musk's service ends after the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. During his tenure, DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though these figures have faced scrutiny. Despite criticism from Democrats in Congress, Musk's return to the private sector has been welcomed by markets, with Tesla shares rising on the news, indicating that he will now allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has concluded, marked by significant changes to federal spending and sparking considerable controversy. Musk aimed to cut federal spending, initially targeting $2 trillion before shifting to $175 billion in claimed savings through asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions. His presence in the White House raised concerns about conflicts of interest due to his companies' business dealings with the U.S. government, and his cuts to USAID programs aligned with the administration's "America First" approach. Musk also faced criticism for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation during his time in office.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction to stabilize the rail line, which serves Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, by placing 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand along the tracks. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the total cost of the projects at approximately $300 million.
