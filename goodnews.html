          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent visit to Washington D.C. was largely overshadowed by the public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Despite the distraction, the visit was considered a success for Merz, who managed to address several key issues with Trump, including strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Merz also emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending and presented Trump with his grandfather's birth certificate to highlight the historical ties between the two nations. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided during the discussions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a recent jobs report indicating a stronger-than-expected labor market. Trump argued that such a cut would lower both long- and short-term debt rates and boost the economy, even suggesting that Powell could raise rates again if inflation were to increase. This latest demand continues Trump's pattern of pressuring the Fed for lower rates, a dynamic that has become routine during his second term. Trump maintains that the U.S. economy is thriving despite Powell's policies.</p>

          <p>Food firms are increasingly working to reduce the number of ingredients in their products in response to growing consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers are seeing increased demand for simpler ingredient lists, leading brands to launch new product lines with fewer additives. However, some nutritionists caution against prioritizing fewer ingredients over nutritional value, emphasizing the importance of fortified nutrients in certain products. Experts suggest that simplifying formulas and utilizing novel processing technologies can help create less processed foods while maintaining safety and extending shelf life.</p>

While tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly affect used car sales, they influence the market by impacting new vehicle prices, production, and overall demand.
