          <p>Shares of American Eagle rose by approximately 5% after the apparel retailer announced a collaboration with football star Travis Kelce, whose sportswear brand, Tru Kolors, is launching a limited-edition collection. This partnership, which had been in the works for over a year, was announced shortly after Kelce's highly publicized proposal to singer Taylor Swift, generating significant internet buzz. The company hopes this collaboration, featuring vintage-inspired T-shirts and redesigned varsity jackets, will replicate the meme-stock fashion surge seen after its previous partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney. The announcement underscores the impact of celebrity endorsements on retail stock performance and brand visibility in a competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A looming federal judge's ruling could dismantle Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with $20 billion impacting Apple. While Apple faces a significant financial hit, some analysts suggest Google could benefit long-term by reallocating funds from these costly deals to its burgeoning AI and cloud sectors. The Justice Department's antitrust case, which already found Google held a search monopoly, aims to foster competition, but experts debate the effectiveness of such remedies given Google's inherent market dominance and user preference. The outcome could reshape the internet's future, especially as Google's Gemini AI platform vies for integration into devices like Apple's, currently dominated by OpenAI's ChatGPT.

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite a continued decline in sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upward, signaling progress amidst leadership turmoil and broader economic challenges. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged the impact of lower- and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted initiatives like reintroducing petite sections, expanding jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies to regain customer loyalty. While sales growth remains a long-term goal, the improved financial results and strategic adjustments indicate a positive trajectory for the struggling department store. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet approved a new bill to boost its military, aiming for 260,000 active soldiers and 200,000 reservists by the early 2030s, up from 183,000 today. While military service remains voluntary, the law mandates an obligatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, with medical examinations becoming compulsory from July 2027, even for those opting out. The plan, driven by increased Russian threat and NATO commitments, includes higher salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and travel to attract recruits. Despite conservative skepticism about the voluntary scheme's effectiveness and calls for a return to conscription, the government believes the approach is a significant step forward, acknowledging current infrastructure limitations for a full conscription.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose's New York-listed shares surged nearly 15% following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the luxury winter-clothing maker private. Sources indicate that Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion. Goldman Sachs is advising Bain Capital on the sale, which aims to offload its holding in the Toronto-listed company. This development signifies a potential shift in ownership and strategy for Canada Goose, offering outsized returns for Bain Capital since its 2013 acquisition, despite the company's market value being significantly lower than its 2018 peak.

          <p>Recent changes to the federal student loan system have made it challenging for borrowers to obtain accurate information and connect with representatives from the Department of Education or their loan servicers. Borrowers report encountering conflicting information and enduring long wait times, which can lead to significant financial consequences if they are unable to access affordable repayment plans. Experts advise contacting the Federal Student Aid Information Center early on weekday mornings or using its live chat for Department of Education queries. For detailed account information and repayment navigation, reaching out to one's specific loan servicer is recommended, alongside exploring local non-profit organizations and state Student Loan Ombudsmen for additional support.</p>

Structured discursively, the memoir weaves together memories, nightmares, and letters to her late sister, Marjorie, revealing writing as a means of living with unspeakable loss rather than resolving it. Toews ultimately discovers that writing, like silence, serves as an "ally," a way of holding onto her loved ones and sustaining her own will to live.</p>
