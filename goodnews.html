          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:36:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing grants of up to £3,750 to reduce the cost of new electric cars, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles. These discounts, part of a £650 million scheme, apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000, with more environmentally friendly models receiving larger reductions. While the initiative is welcomed by some carmakers, critics highlight the persistent need for significantly more public charging points, especially for households without driveways. The policy seeks to make zero-emission cars more affordable and support the automotive sector, despite concerns from some political figures about forcing families into more expensive vehicles.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts aboard a SpaceX capsule successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, concluding Axiom Space's 20-day private Ax-4 mission to the International Space Station. The pre-dawn return included a sonic boom that rattled parts of southern California. This mission marked several milestones, including the maiden voyage of SpaceX's newest capsule, Grace, and extended Commander Peggy Whitson's record for cumulative time in space by a U.S. astronaut. The crew, which included astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, conducted approximately 60 scientific experiments, making it the most research-intensive Axiom Space flight to date.</p>

          <h2>China Merchants Bank Subsidiary Granted Virtual Asset License in Hong Kong</h2>

          <p>CMBI, the brokerage arm of China Merchants Bank, has received a virtual asset license in Hong Kong, enabling it to offer a range of services including trading, custody, and advisory for virtual assets. This development positions CMBI to access Hong Kong's growing crypto market, though it must adhere to strict regulations preventing direct mainland participation. The move reflects Hong Kong's broader strategy to embrace digital assets and attract global investors, as traditional financial institutions increasingly engage with the crypto industry. Mainland brokers with international operations are actively seeking such licenses to expand their reach in the global digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Hints at Potential Renaming of 'Soccer' to 'Football' in the US</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested he could officially change the U.S. term "soccer" to "football," aligning the country with global nomenclature for the sport. Speaking to DAZN TV during the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, Trump, who was present at the match, jokingly entertained the idea of an executive order for the renaming. While "football" is widely used internationally, the U.S., Canada, and Australia commonly refer to the game as "soccer." This comment, made as the U.S. hosted a newly expanded global tournament, underscores Trump's increasing engagement with what the British call "the Beautiful Game" and its cultural terminology.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially debuted its Model Y electric SUV in India, with an initial price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other major markets like the U.S. This launch coincides with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai, with another planned for New Delhi. The high pricing is attributed to India's substantial import tariffs and luxury taxes on EVs, positioning the Model Y as a premium competitor against brands like BMW rather than mass-market local EVs. Experts suggest Tesla is primarily "testing the waters" in India, focusing on early adopters and strategic soft power moves rather than immediate large-scale sales or local manufacturing commitments.</p>

The 35-year-old brings extensive experience, including Premier League and Champions League titles with Liverpool. Brentford manager Keith Andrews highlighted Henderson's continued fitness and motivation, emphasizing his leadership qualities and ability to drive standards within the squad. Henderson's move comes after a brief and controversial stint in Saudi Arabia and a year at Ajax, where his contract was mutually terminated early due to financial considerations and reported on-field tensions. He is expected to fill a void left by key departures, aiming to bolster Brentford's midfield.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, essential for artificial intelligence development, to China. This marks a reversal of previous administration policy, which had tightened controls on tech exports to China due to national security concerns. Huang emphasized the importance of American companies competing in China's innovative AI market, where half of the world's AI researchers reside. While this move could boost Nvidia's revenue, Chinese firms remain wary of potential abrupt policy shifts, highlighting the ongoing trade rivalry and its impact on the global semiconductor supply chain.

Designed to be stable by being backed one-to-one with reserves like the U.S. dollar, they offer the promise of instantaneous, borderless money transfers, circumventing traditional banking fees and delays. While Congress is on the verge of adopting legislation to regulate them, critics raise concerns about their safety, potential for illicit use by actors like drug dealers, and the risk of "runs on the bank" that could impact the financial system. Despite these risks, proponents envision a payment revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Writer Melissa Febos embarked on a year of celibacy at age 35, seeking to break free from obsessive relationship patterns and cultivate a more authentic connection to intimacy. Her new memoir, "The Dry Season," chronicles this period, during which she divested from all sex- and dating-related activities. Febos discovered that redirecting the energy previously spent on relationships allowed her to thrive creatively, engage more politically, and deepen other forms of intimacy. This experience led to profound self-discovery, highlighting the surprising benefits of abstinence for personal growth and ultimately fostering a healthier, more honest relationship with her now-wife.</p>

Despite an opening defeat to France, significant wins against the Netherlands and Wales have bolstered confidence in their title defense. Analysis shows the team has diversified its goal scorers and adapted its attacking focus, particularly utilizing Lauren James on the right flank. While conceding more goals than in 2022, the defense has improved after a tough opener against a higher-ranked opponent. The team's ability to overcome a slow start, a familiar pattern, suggests they are finding their stride.</p>
