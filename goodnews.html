          <h2>India Considers Zero Tariffs with the U.S. Amid Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 03:04:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Indian exports, which are currently suspended. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S., India's largest trading partner, could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. However, concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing and the potential for a flood of U.S. goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A West Point philosophy professor, Graham Parsons, resigned after 13 years, citing the academy's shift away from its educational principles due to the Trump administration's influence. Parsons claimed the academy was eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. Pete Hegseth responded to Parsons' resignation by saying he would not be missed. Parsons' resignation followed an executive order and memos restricting faculty members' teaching content at military educational institutions, leading to what he described as a sweeping assault on the school's curriculum and faculty research.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July to navigate U.S. export restrictions. The downgraded H20 chip, which had been Nvidia's most powerful AI chip cleared for Chinese sales, will have reduced memory capacity. This move aims to maintain Nvidia's presence in China, a crucial market, despite increasing U.S. efforts to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. Downstream customers might modify the module configuration to adjust the chip's performance levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible reduction in U.S. tariffs on goods from China as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. He referenced the current tariff rate of 145%, implying it would decrease. Trump made these remarks while unveiling a tariffs deal with the UK. The meeting in Switzerland signifies a willingness from both sides to de-escalate trade tensions. Experts warn that any tariff cuts resulting from the meeting will likely be minor.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, aiming to lower tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market and reduced non-tariff barriers. While a 10% tariff remains on some U.K. imports, the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to that rate, with higher rates for additional vehicles. The agreement is viewed as a significant step in strengthening the relationship between the two countries.</p>
