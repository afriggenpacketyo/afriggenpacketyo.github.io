          <p>A significant 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting initial tsunami advisories for parts of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, which were later canceled. The governor of the Kamchatka region also issued a local tsunami warning, urging residents to be aware of the potential danger. Despite the powerful tremor, authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic event. Officials also stated there was no subsequent tsunami threat to other Pacific regions, including Hawaii and Canada.</p>

          <p>Beijing's efforts to curb a damaging price war within China's solar-equipment industry are showing early signs of success, according to market analysts. Government-led initiatives, including proposed limits on power usage for manufacturing plants, have contributed to a recent rise in prices for solar products like polysilicon. This price recovery is expected to help leading manufacturers return to profitability after enduring 18 months of financial losses. The positive policy sentiment has already supported a 5 to 7 percent increase in prices for key solar components over the past month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has completed a transaction valued at over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other key employees from the AI hardware startup, as well as to license its technology. The deal, paid in cash and stock, is structured similarly to recent AI talent acquisitions by other tech giants, allowing Nvidia to absorb top engineering talent without a formal acquisition. Enfabrica, which Nvidia had previously invested in, specializes in technology that can connect over 100,000 GPUs, enhancing Nvidia's ability to offer large-scale, integrated AI computing systems.

Head coach Eddie Howe praised his team's commitment and heart but lamented missed opportunities in the first half that could have changed the game's outcome. A double from Barcelona's Marcus Rashford secured the win for the visitors, though a late goal from Newcastle's Anthony Gordon provided a moment of hope. The home crowd applauded the team's effort at full-time, acknowledging their competitive display against one of Europe's top clubs.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate the storm will intensify, possibly reaching low-grade hurricane status over the weekend, but it is expected to remain over open waters for several days. The current forecast track shows Gabrielle moving north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could potentially bring some impacts to Bermuda by early next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing devices, envisioning a more natural user interface based on voice, sight, and gestures. The statement came as the company revealed its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by hand movements via a neural wristband. This new generation of smart glasses aims to move beyond audio-only functions to allow users to see messages and watch videos.

The new budget amendment directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff reductions and the delay of a legally required annual report on global trafficking.

The team, which has led Major League Baseball in attendance every year since 2013, will officially cross the threshold during their final regular season game. This achievement is a rarity in modern baseball, as no team has reached the 4-million mark since 2008, largely due to smaller modern stadium capacities. The Dodgers' on-field success and the addition of global superstar Shohei Ohtani have been credited with boosting attendance to this record level.</p>
