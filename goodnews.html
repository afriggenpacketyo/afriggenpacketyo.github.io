          <p>Billionaire tech entrepreneur Lucy Guo, known for co-founding Scale AI and establishing Passes, adheres to an exceptionally rigorous daily routine, beginning her day at 5:30 a.m. with back-to-back gym sessions and frequently forgoing lunch breaks. Despite her considerable fortune, Guo champions a relentless work ethic, contending that individuals could achieve better work-life balance by eliminating unproductive habits. Her demanding schedule mirrors a prevalent Silicon Valley ethos, which she advocates for nascent founders, although some industry figures criticize it as an antiquated and unsustainable model. This article also briefly touches upon a recent class action lawsuit against her company, Passes, which Guo vehemently denies as a "shakedown."</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, majestically shooting an arc of lava 100 feet into the air from its summit crater, marking its 31st such display since December. This highly active volcano continues a pattern of repeated episodes, driven by magma continuously flowing into a lower chamber and then being forced to the surface through narrow vents. The current eruption is safely contained within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, posing no threat to nearby homes, and offers spectacular, roaring views for fortunate visitors and online audiences. Scientists are diligently monitoring the activity, noting that while recent lava fountains have been shorter, the long-term evolution of this eruption remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. This decision extends a preliminary injunction, characterizing the administration's executive orders as an unconstitutional "coercive threat" designed to compel cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The Trump administration had aggressively pursued policies to penalize jurisdictions limiting assistance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the court found these actions to be unlawful. This ruling safeguards billions of dollars for these localities and highlights the ongoing legal and political conflicts surrounding national immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, managing only three hits throughout the game, which resulted in them falling back into a tie for first place in the National League West. Despite a strong seven-inning pitching performance from Blake Snell, the Dodgers' offense struggled significantly against Padres pitcher Yu Darvish, who effectively utilized his varied pitch repertoire. A critical checked-swing call in the third inning proved to be a turning point, contributing to the Padres scoring their two runs. This disappointing defeat follows a week where the Dodgers squandered an earlier division lead, highlighting their ongoing struggle to build consistent late-season momentum.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that his artificial intelligence venture, xAI, is actively developing a "purely AI software company" named "Macrohard," with the ambitious goal of simulating software giants like Microsoft entirely through artificial intelligence. Musk posits that this endeavor is feasible given that software companies do not produce any physical hardware themselves. Described as a "very real" project despite its tongue-in-cheek name, a trademark for "Macrohard" has already been filed, outlining a broad spectrum of AI-focused goods and services. This initiative further solidifies Musk's aggressive push into the fields of AI and robotics, integrating these technologies across his diverse portfolio of ventures, including Tesla.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has announced a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move designed to retain these globally prized raw materials onshore and stimulate investment in downstream industries. This decision positions Malaysia as a crucial potential alternative supplier for the mineral-hungry United States, which is actively seeking non-Chinese sources amidst strained trade relations with China. Analysts suggest Malaysia's existing processing capacity provides it with a significant head start in integrating into global supply chains. The ban signals Malaysia's intent to leverage its geoeconomic agency, prioritizing national development while attracting foreign investment into its domestic processing sector.

          <p>Hong Kong has officially surpassed the United States as the primary venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies during the first eight months of 2025. This achievement marks a significant milestone for Hong Kong's capital market, with 46 Chinese firms collectively raising $16.5 billion in the city, starkly contrasting with 16 listings in the US that garnered only $740.9 million. This notable shift is primarily driven by Hong Kong's more active market, higher average share jumps on debut, and persistent delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. The trend indicates a broader return of investment funds to Asia, influenced by both regulatory prospects and market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a prominent car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to charity after losing a second court appeal against Hannah Robinson, a woman it relentlessly pursued over parking charges. Robinson was initially targeted for exceeding a controversial "five-minute payment rule" at a Darlington car park, a policy that has since been banned by the private parking sector. Despite this industry-wide change and widespread criticism, Excel Parking aggressively continued its legal action against her. The court ultimately ruled Excel's conduct "unreasonable and out of the norm," ordering the payment to the Access to Justice Foundation, marking a significant victory for consumer rights against predatory parking enforcement practices.</p>
