          <h2>London Mayor Supports Report Calling for Cannabis Decriminalization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 04:35:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use, suggesting removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Lord Falconer, who chaired the London Drugs Commission, argues the current law disproportionately affects ethnic communities due to stop and search practices. While Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force will adhere to existing laws, Khan emphasized the need for fresh thinking on drug-related crime. The report also recommends improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis, though critics like David Raynes caution against sending the wrong message to youth. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding cannabis policy and its impact on public health and criminal justice.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a ¬£122.7m fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for breaches relating to its sewage operations and shareholder payouts. Ofwat stated the fines are a result of its "biggest and most complex investigation" and will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. The fines include ¬£104.5m for sewage operation breaches and ¬£18.2m for shareholder payout breaches, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a company for such payouts. Thames Water has faced criticism for sewage discharges and leaks and is burdened by a ¬£20bn debt, though a recent ¬£3bn rescue loan staved off collapse; water supplies and waste services will continue as normal regardless of the company's future. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Germany to meet with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in as many weeks, to secure financial assistance for expanding Ukraine's domestic arms production. Zelenskyy emphasized that financial support, estimated at $30 billion annually, is crucial for manufacturing attack drones, interceptors, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems. The visit underscores Germany's growing role in supporting Ukraine amid weakening U.S. commitments to NATO, and the need to maintain foreign industrial assistance. Zelenskyy also highlighted the importance of expanded sanctions against Russia to slow down its forces and raise the cost of war for the Kremlin.</p>

Travelers are reportedly purchasing the toys overseas and bringing them back into China to profit from resales. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded internationally with over 500 stores in more than 30 countries. The high prices are attributed to both hype and the effects of international popularity, creating business opportunities to promote consumption.</p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI technology, including overhead cameras, to some self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, leading to comparisons with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. The cameras identify when shoppers fail to scan items properly, displaying a live-action replay. While some shoppers mocked the technology, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance, with some saying they would avoid self-checkout lanes. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, with retailers reporting significant financial losses due to theft.</p>
