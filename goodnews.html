          <p>New Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is already establishing a standard of protection for his teammates during training camp. Speaking on a podcast, Rodgers recounted an incident where he admonished the offensive line after another quarterback was knocked down, telling them to act as "policemen" on the field. He stressed the importance of protecting all players and backing each other up, noting that he saw a positive response from the line in a subsequent situation. This leadership demonstrates his immediate impact on the team's culture ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>Beijing-based robotic vacuum company Roborock plans to significantly reduce the price of its high-end household cleaning robots, making advanced models accessible to the mass market. The company's president, Quan Gang, predicts that its latest cleaner featuring an AI-powered robotic arm, currently priced around $2,600, could eventually sell for just a few hundred dollars. This strategy is part of a larger vision for household human-like robots to become common by 2030, driven by generative AI. The company is expanding its AI research and development to achieve this goal.</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb destructive, cutthroat price wars that have plagued various industries, including the solar panel sector. The revision, currently open for public feedback, targets what is locally known as "involution," where excessive competition leads to companies selling products at a loss and harms overall industry health. The move comes after calls from authorities to establish a more sustainable market equilibrium. This regulatory adjustment aims to stabilize industries suffering from severe oversupply and homogenised products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory against Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League play-off, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory mood was bittersweet, however, as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure post-match. The win represents a significant milestone for the club, which also won the FA Cup and Community Shield in 2025, but now faces the challenge of replacing a key player.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their recently traded star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one. The unusual move comes after the club acquired midfielder Paxten Aaronson in a record deal to replace Mihailović, who requested a trade to Toronto FC for personal reasons. The jersey swap program is a gesture of goodwill to fans who may have recently purchased memorabilia for a player who surprisingly departed mid-season. Such exchange programs are rare in professional sports but serve to build fan loyalty.</p>

          <p>Workday, a provider of finance and human resources software, reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates. However, the company's stock dipped in after-hours trading as it provided guidance that was merely in line with expectations and highlighted potential headwinds. CEO Carl Eschenbach noted challenges in its business with state and local governments due to funding uncertainties and in higher education, which faces pressure from the Trump administration's policies. The company also announced its acquisition of conversational AI recruiting software company Paradox. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm did not make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks, where some evacuation and storm surge warnings remain in effect. The National Hurricane Center continues to caution against swimming along most of the East Coast due to life-threatening rip currents generated by the large storm system. Erin is expected to weaken and become a post-tropical cyclone by Saturday.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a method to defer capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or privately seeded exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. This allows the investor to avoid an immediate tax bill on their profits, though gains are realized when the ETF shares are eventually sold. The strategy has strict diversification requirements and potential downsides, such as being locked into a specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>
