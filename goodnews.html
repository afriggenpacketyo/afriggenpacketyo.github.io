          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the government of Qatar, according to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the luxury plane following federal rules and regulations, and the Department of Defense will work to ensure the jet fulfills proper security measures and functional-mission requirements, as President Trump intends to use it as the new Air Force One. This acceptance follows previous discussions about the potential use of the gifted jet, with the administration now moving forward with integrating it into the presidential fleet.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill that would provide a tax break on tip income, with both President Trump and Vice President Harris previously expressing support for such a measure during appearances in Nevada. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, though tips must be reported to qualify for the deduction. While the bill could benefit moderate to middle-income workers in tipped occupations, such as those in restaurants, hotels, and courier services, it may not significantly benefit part-time employees or the lowest income workers. Potential issues could arise, such as the introduction of tips in new occupations or misclassification of income as tips.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose rose nearly 30% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates, though it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to "macroeconomic uncertainty." The luxury retailer cited dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment as the reason for not providing a financial outlook. Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose remains confident in its brand strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company's revenue increased by 7.4% from the same period last year, and CEO Dani Reiss emphasized the company's history of successfully navigating challenging times.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing trade standoff between the U.S. and China, a debate has emerged regarding Chinese investment in the U.S., particularly in advanced manufacturing sectors.

These companies are building plants in the U.S. to access the market, creating jobs and transferring technology. This article argues that embracing Chinese investment could defuse tensions and benefit the U.S. economy, calling for a rational approach rather than paranoia.</p>
