          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and marking a return to growth after two consecutive declines. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents missed analyst estimates, causing the stock to fall in after-hours trading. The drop in net income was attributed to lower electric vehicle prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly driven by investments in AI and other research projects. The report also highlighted a continuing sales slump in Europe and uncertainty around future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines exceeded Wall Street expectations by posting a surprise profit in the third quarter and has forecasted record revenue for the final quarter of the year. The optimistic outlook is attributed to strong travel demand and higher fares, with the carrier expecting unit revenue to rise by 1% to 3%. Despite the positive forecast, the airline's third-quarter profit of $54 million was down more than 19% from the previous year. The company is also implementing changes, such as abandoning open seating, to better compete with rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from Tokyo Medical and Dental University suggests that the process of hair turning gray may be linked to the body's defense mechanisms against melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Researchers found that pigment-producing stem cells, when stressed or damaged, can either die off, resulting in gray hair, or multiply in a way that could lead to cancer. This process is described as a biological trade-off, where eliminating damaged cells to prevent cancer results in graying. The findings reframe graying and melanoma as two different outcomes of the same cellular stress response.</p>

          <p>Officials from the former Biden administration are urging a shift in U.S. industrial policy, recommending a focus on strategic, high-tech sectors rather than a broad attempt to revive all manufacturing. Gina Raimondo, former Commerce Secretary, argued at a Harvard Kennedy School event that policy should concentrate on areas of true national security concern and competitive advantage, like the semiconductor industry. She expressed disagreement with the current administration's goal to "make everything in America," suggesting the U.S. lacks a competitive edge in producing certain consumer goods and should prioritize cutting-edge technologies.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released a new web browser named ChatGPT Atlas, which integrates its AI chatbot directly into the browsing experience to rethink how users interact with the internet. The browser, built on the same foundation as Google Chrome, allows users to query ChatGPT from any webpage, access "browser memories" for context, and use an "agent" mode for tasks like booking vacations. While positioned as a revolutionary step, the launch is also seen as part of OpenAI's strategy to commercialize its technology and gather more user data to fund its expensive AI development.</p>

          <h2>New Research Links Gum Disease to Increased Risk of Stroke and Brain Damage</h2>

          <p>Two new studies suggest a strong association between poor oral health and cardiovascular problems, including stroke and brain damage. One study found that adults with gum disease are more likely to show signs of damage to the brain's white matter, a condition linked to inflammation and hardening of blood vessels. A second study revealed that having both gum disease and cavities is associated with an 86% increased risk of stroke. The research emphasizes that while it doesn't prove causation, maintaining good oral hygiene could significantly lower the risk of adverse heart and brain events.</p>

          <p>IBM reported strong third-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, and raised its full-year guidance. The company cited positive momentum from its artificial intelligence business, which has grown to a $9.5 million book of business. Despite the positive report, which showed a 9% increase in revenue from the previous year, the company's stock fell by 5% in extended trading. All of IBM's major segments, including software, consulting, and infrastructure, reported revenue growth for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows High-Yield Savings Accounts Still Offer Substantial Interest Earnings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:27:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a slight decrease from recent peaks, high-yield savings accounts continue to offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts, which average just 0.40% interest. With typical rates around 4.30%, savers can still earn substantial interest, with a $10,000 deposit potentially yielding over $430 in one year. The article contrasts this with variable rates and suggests that Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts may be a better option for those concerned about future rate cuts, as CDs offer fixed rates for a set term.

          <h2>Economic Analysis Suggests Americans May Receive Larger Tax Refunds Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Oxford Economics suggests that many American taxpayers could receive larger tax refunds in 2026 due to new tax provisions that are retroactive to the current year. The changes, part of a recent Republican tax bill, are expected to result in an additional $50 billion in taxpayer savings. Because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables to reflect the new breaks, many employees are likely overpaying their taxes throughout the year. The analysis notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits will likely accrue to upper-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

Members cleared the rubble and built a stage over the ruins to host the event, raising funds and spirits for the reconstruction effort. The nonprofit, originally founded to enrich the lives of factory workers in Vienna, has evolved into a diverse cultural haven for nature lovers. Volunteers are now leading the effort to rebuild the lodge, preserving its alpine character while adding modern features.</p>

          <p>Public tours of the White House have been suspended for approximately two months due to the demolition and construction work on the new ballroom, which has made the East Wing entrance inaccessible. Officials have indicated that they expect to establish an updated tour route in the coming days, allowing visits and other public events like Halloween trick-or-treating to resume. In the interim, staff from several East Wing offices have been temporarily relocated to other parts of the White House complex and the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building to accommodate the ongoing construction.</p>
