With CD rates still comfortably high, the article suggests that now is an ideal time to either renew a CD or shop around for a new one to lock in favorable rates. This window may be temporary, as banks could lower rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, making prompt action advantageous for maximizing savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by strong growth in its advertising business and a 13% sales increase. However, the company's stock fell over 7% in after-hours trading after it provided a third-quarter operating income forecast that was lighter than anticipated. The guidance raised investor concerns about the high costs associated with its significant investments in artificial intelligence and growing competition in the cloud computing sector.</p>

While Mac sales also grew nearly 15%, the company's iPad and wearables divisions experienced revenue declines during the same period, showing mixed performance across its product lines.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated, the article compares the returns of depositing $20,000 in a high-yield savings account versus a money market account. Based on current average rates, calculations show a high-yield savings account offers slightly higher earnings over six, nine, and twelve months. However, the piece notes that the difference is marginal and advises savers to also consider account features, such as the check-writing capabilities that money market accounts typically offer.

The film is said to adhere closely to the original's beloved style of silly yet creative humor, with Liam Neeson receiving praise for his unexpectedly entertaining deadpan performance as the son of the original protagonist. Despite a simple plot, the review highlights the film's success in delivering genuine laughs through clever wordplay and well-executed slapstick comedy.</p>

The initial deployment was met with strong criticism from California officials, who argued it was unnecessary and diverted resources from other critical duties like wildfire fighting. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, local leaders are continuing to pressure for a full withdrawal.</p>
