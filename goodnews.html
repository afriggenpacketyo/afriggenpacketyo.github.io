        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, experts are divided on the likely outcome, presenting compelling cases for both fighters. Crawford's supporters point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and potential to expose a perceived decline in Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage at super-middleweight, his ring intelligence, and Crawford's less convincing performance in his last fight at a lower weight. The article thoroughly analyzes each fighter's strengths and weaknesses, making it clear why the matchup is considered one of the most intriguing in modern boxing.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the collapse of the previous government, Nepal has sworn in its first female interim prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The youth-led "GenZ" demonstrations, fueled by economic frustrations and a social media ban, successfully pushed for new leadership. In a move to restore stability, the president dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5, as recommended by the new prime minister. With Karki's appointment, a sense of calm has returned to the capital, Kathmandu, as curfews are eased and troop presence is reduced.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously boost its birth rate and strengthen its scientific talent pool, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The initiative, starting with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 eligible new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have given birth within the last two years. While the program's initial scope is limited, it is viewed by some female researchers as a positive step toward addressing career challenges faced by women in science.</p>

Despite early start times, temperatures climbed to 30°C with over 90% humidity, creating brutal conditions for the 35km race walk. Japan celebrated a poignant victory as Hayato Katsuki secured a bronze medal, giving the home crowd a chance to cheer after being barred from the 2020 Olympics due to the pandemic.
