          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is urging investors to control their market fears following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to previous downgrades by S&P and Fitch that led to market declines. Cramer argues that the downgrade has prompted more fear than is warranted by the short-term economic environment. He advises investors to view the situation as an early warning to invest more, not more aggressively, and suggests gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against government borrowing. He cautions against selling based on fear, reminding investors that those who spread fear may have ulterior motives. (not investment advice)</p>
