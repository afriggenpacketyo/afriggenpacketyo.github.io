          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by surging rice prices and reduced energy subsidies, marking the highest level in over two years. This increase is putting pressure on the Bank of Japan, as Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates while closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. The country's prime minister has pledged to lower rice prices, staking his job on the line, as the cost of living continues to rise for Japanese consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in April climbed 3.5 percent from a year earlier, increasing at the fastest pace in more than two years, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and surging rice prices, government data showed Friday. The increase in the nationwide core consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh food, followed a 3.2 percent rise in March and was the largest since January 2023, with the key gauge of inflation having remained at or above the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target since April 2022. Higher rice prices are likely to continue pushing up prices in the service sector, which includes the dining industry, supporting the case for the BOJ to raise interest rates if Japan produces a favorable outcome in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>
