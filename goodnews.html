          <p>An international peace summit, co-chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, is scheduled for Monday in Egypt to address the Gaza conflict. In anticipation of a ceasefire agreement, families of Israeli hostages have been notified that the release process will begin Monday morning, with comprehensive preparations made for both living and deceased individuals. Concurrently, Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner addressed a rally in Tel Aviv, conveying a message of support from the president. Meanwhile, the Gaza Health Ministry reported an additional 151 fatalities in the past 24 hours as rescue crews accessed previously unsafe areas.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits like flight or echolocation. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, moved beyond traditional methods by examining complex 3D structural features in proteins that evolved separately but serve similar functions. This innovative approach has revealed a previously underrated sequence basis for how functional traits can converge across different species, offering new insights into the genetic and protein-level mechanics of evolution.</p>

          <p>The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan antigovernment activist María Corina Machado has elicited polarized reactions, with supporters seeing it as a sign of hope and government loyalists condemning it as part of a U.S.-led plot. Machado, a controversial figure even within the opposition for her praise of Donald Trump, dedicated the prize to the Venezuelan people and Trump. The award has raised questions about its potential impact on U.S. policy toward Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. While some hope the prize will hold Machado to a higher standard for achieving a democratic transition, others worry it could negatively affect Venezuelans in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase humanitarian aid entering Gaza, with an expected 600 trucks per day. Egypt is sending 400 trucks of supplies, which will undergo Israeli inspection before entry, while the UN has 170,000 metric tons of aid ready for deployment. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. As displaced Palestinians begin returning to their devastated homes, armed police from the Hamas-run Interior Ministry have been seen securing aid routes in areas vacated by Israeli forces, signaling a shift in on-the-ground dynamics.</p>

          <h2>Elite Footballers Increasingly Turn to Private Coaches for a Competitive Edge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite having access to top-tier coaching at their clubs, a growing number of professional footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches to refine specific aspects of their game. These coaches offer personalized, one-on-one sessions that allow players to work on details they might not focus on in a group setting. While players see it as a way to build confidence and improve performance, some club managers express concern about the risk of injury and overexertion. Proponents argue that collaboration between private coaches and clubs is key to ensuring the player's development and safety.</p>

          <p>China has initiated what is being called a “project of the century”: a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. The project faces extreme engineering challenges, as it will traverse high-altitude mountain ranges, glaciers, and permafrost zones, with an average altitude above 4,500 meters. With a potential cost of 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), it is set to be one of China's most expensive rail lines ever built. A state-owned company has been established to build and operate the line, which is a significant undertaking for Beijing both in terms of investment and overcoming formidable geographical obstacles.</p>

          <p>The European Union is beginning the phased rollout of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track when non-EU citizens enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, upon their first use. EES will eventually replace manual passport stamping and is intended to enhance security and streamline travel. The six-month gradual introduction is underway at key transit points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, with full implementation across all Schengen borders expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>At its party conference, Welsh political party Plaid Cymru endorsed a proposal to create a “standing commission” to develop a white paper on Welsh independence. However, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth clarified that this plan is not for the next government term, suggesting it would be pursued if the party were to win power in both the 2026 and 2030 Senedd elections. This move represents a step back from the party's previous commitment to hold an independence referendum within five years. The immediate focus will be on engaging the public in a national debate about Wales's constitutional future and pursuing enhanced devolution.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the team to World Cup qualification, viewing it as a way to “put right” the painful playoff defeat to Ukraine for the 2022 finals. Scotland is currently well-positioned in its qualifying group, level on points with leader Denmark, and faces a crucial match against Belarus. Having successfully guided the team to the last two European Championships, Clarke is now focused on ending Scotland's 28-year absence from the men's World Cup. A victory could secure at least a play-off spot, keeping the dream of automatic qualification alive.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the option for Muslim students and employees to take unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has sparked a national debate. While some media outlets inaccurately framed it as “extra holidays,” the regulation simply affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to provisions for Catholic and Protestant holidays in different states. The discussion reflects Germany's broader conversation about integration, cultural identity, and ensuring equal treatment for all religious communities within its patchwork of state-regulated public holidays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into an entirely new plant. Published in the journal Cell, their research identifies two genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state, a process known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability, previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs, provides profound new insights into plant biology and development. The findings could have significant implications for agriculture, conservation, and the fundamental understanding of cellular pluripotency in living organisms.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University, where her mother is registered, to explore the process. The article highlights how medical students learn from donated bodies, which they call their “silent teachers,” and the emotional experience for donor families who may wait up to three years for a funeral. Inspired by her mother's wish to give back and help future doctors, Owen has also decided to register as a body donor.</p>
