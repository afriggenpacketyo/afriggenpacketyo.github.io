          <p>This article commemorates the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X's birth, exploring his advocacy for Black civil rights through resistance against oppression. It details his early life marked by racism and violence, leading to his involvement with the Nation of Islam and his denouncement of white society. The article also highlights his transformative pilgrimage to Mecca, which shifted his views on race and prompted him to seek alliances among oppressed people. Malcolm X's legacy continues to resonate through hip-hop and film, reinforcing Black identity and challenging historical whitewashing. </p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed an artificial intelligence tool capable of detecting dangerous blood clots in real-time. The non-invasive technology uses a high-powered microscope to monitor platelet activity, crucial for managing heart disease. This method allows doctors to directly observe platelet interactions in the bloodstream, potentially leading to more personalized and safer treatments for patients with coronary artery disease. While the tool is not yet ready for widespread use, it offers a promising advancement in patient care by providing immediate insights into the effectiveness of blood-thinning drugs. </p>

          <p>Small religiously affiliated colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing closures and mergers due to declining enrollment and financial difficulties. St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University are exploring a partnership to avoid this fate, highlighting the broader trend affecting institutions that serve rural students and uphold religious values. Many of these colleges cater to low-income, first-generation students who prefer smaller, community-focused environments. Efforts are underway to increase collaboration and awareness of the contributions made by faith-based institutions in higher education. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that altering brick-stacking methods in Bangladesh's kilns could significantly reduce air pollution. The study found that by stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, fuel use could drop by 23 percent. This would reduce carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20 percent. The research team is collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand the training. </p>

          <p>A new internal survey indicates that the German military, the Bundeswehr, does not have systemic extremism, with only 0.4% of soldiers displaying right-wing extremist attitudes.

While the study offers some reassurance, concerns remain about the reliability of voluntary surveys and the normalization of right-wing attitudes in wider society.
