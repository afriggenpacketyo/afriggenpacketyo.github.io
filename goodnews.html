          <h2>Child Development Expert Advocates for Teaching "Self-Connection" as a Core Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can erode their self-trust over time. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and promotes authentic confidence. Parents can encourage this by validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and allowing children age-appropriate autonomy.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A meeting could take place either on the sidelines of the event or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows recent diplomatic engagements between the two nations aimed at stabilizing relations after a period of tension over trade and tariffs. Both leaders have expressed a desire to meet.</p>

          <p>Small, remote towns along Route 66, like Newberry Springs, California, are preparing for the road's 100th anniversary in 2026, hoping it will bring a tourism boom. Once-thriving communities were devastated when the I-40 interstate bypassed them in the 1970s, turning them into near-ghost towns. Now, local residents and business owners are organizing events, creating historical tours, and seeking grants to capitalize on the centennial celebration. They aim to attract visitors while preserving the "frozen in time" rural character of their communities.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues US Labor Market Health Should Be Measured by Income, Not Jobs</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional U.S. labor market metrics, such as job creation numbers, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. The author contends that with the rise of the "gig economy," side hustles, and remote work, a focus on "jobs" fails to capture the full picture of economic well-being. A more relevant measure would be tracking income levels across the working-age population, using data from tax returns and private sources. This shift is necessary for making informed policy decisions in an economy transformed by AI and new work structures.</p>

          <p>Writer Olga Khazan's new book, "Me, But Better," documents her year-long effort to redesign her personality to overcome anxiety and neuroticism. The article explores the science behind this concept with Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, who asserts that personality is not fixed and can be changed through intentional, repeated behavioral shifts. To become more extroverted, Khazan forced herself into uncomfortable social situations like improv classes. This approach suggests that by consciously adopting the behaviors of a desired personality, individuals can fundamentally alter their characteristic ways of thinking and feeling.</p>

She stresses the importance of applicants doing their due diligence on the company and the specific role before the interview. To assess this, she often asks candidates for their opinion on the company's current work, such as its marketing strategies. Johnson is most impressed by candidates who can offer genuine, thoughtful feedback, as it demonstrates a real understanding of and interest in the business.</p>

The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout.

          <p>Following a court order, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The release came after a judge ruled the private foundation was subject to Georgia's Open Records Act in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit. The documents reveal, among other things, the APF's efforts to lobby city council members to derail a public referendum on the project. Activists see the ruling as a crucial precedent for holding private police foundations accountable and preventing them from operating as opaque entities.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for treating diabetes and obesity, are showing potential as a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance and infertility, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain after using the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps rebalance hormones. While promising, larger clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefits and address insurance coverage hurdles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the origins of Superman, arguing that recent conservative backlash to his immigrant identity ignores the character's leftist roots. Comic book author Grant Morrison explains that creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, sons of Jewish immigrants, initially depicted Superman as a "socialist figure" and a "champion of the oppressed." Early comics from the 1930s showed him fighting corrupt bosses and forcing authorities to build low-rent housing. The character's evolution has reflected the times, from a patriotic figure in WWII to a cosmic seeker in the 1960s.</p>
