          <h2>TSMC Reports Significant Profit Surge Driven by Strong AI Chip Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 01:53:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-on-year increase in its second-quarter profit, surpassing market estimates. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to the sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips, a key product for clients like Nvidia and Apple. Despite benefiting from the AI trend, TSMC faces potential challenges from proposed U.S. tariffs, which could impact its trade relations. The company's net revenue also significantly rose, exceeding expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The northern Gulf Coast, particularly southeastern Louisiana, is bracing for heavy rainfall and potential flooding as a weather system over the Florida Panhandle shows a 40% chance of developing into a tropical depression. Regardless of intensification, officials warn of 3 to 10 inches of rain through Saturday, prompting New Orleans residents to prepare with sandbags. This threat follows a summer of lethal floods, including recent events in New York City and Texas. Local communities are mobilizing, with volunteers and officials distributing supplies, demonstrating community resilience in the face of impending severe weather.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Lynagh, 22, will start as fly-half for Australia in Saturday's first Test against the British and Irish Lions, following in the footsteps of his Wallaby legend father, Michael Lynagh. This marks his fourth cap, stepping in for regular starter Noah Lolesio. Coach Joe Schmidt has made four changes to the starting XV that recently defeated Fiji, with key forward Rob Valetini and giant lock Will Skelton absent due to injury, though close to selection. The team faces a significant challenge against an in-form Lions side, with Schmidt downplaying Australia's chances in the three-Test series.</p>

          <p>A trio of crypto regulation bills finally moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives after a marathon 10-hour vote, overcoming a two-day stalemate caused by opposition from conservative and moderate Republicans.

Despite President Trump's intervention, new objections emerged, forcing last-minute tweaks. For the crypto industry, which heavily lobbied for these bills, the struggle was a setback, raising questions about the future of a comprehensive regulatory framework.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake initially prompted a warning. The quake struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, leading to evacuations in Seward. Despite multiple aftershocks, experts indicated that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the earthquake's shallow depth. The U.S. Coast Guard and National Weather Service stood down their responses as the threat passed, ensuring no danger to Anchorage. While a significant seismic event, the prompt and effective response, along with the lack of severe consequences, mitigated the potential for disaster.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to power the energy-intensive AI industry, used electric vehicle (EV) batteries are being repurposed to fuel AI data centers in Nevada. Crusoe, an AI cloud platform, utilizes these recycled batteries from Redwood Materials, which recovered over 20 gigawatt hours of lithium-ion batteries in 2024. This initiative offers a renewable alternative to traditional gas-fired plants, which are increasingly being proposed to meet the soaring electricity demands of data centers. The modular and cost-effective system aims to provide reliable, sustainable power, sidestepping the "dirtiest part of the AI boom" and offering a scalable solution for the industry's growing energy needs.</p>
