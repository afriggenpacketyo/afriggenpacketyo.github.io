          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:10:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin experienced a slight increase on Tuesday, demonstrating a degree of independence from the broader stock market decline, while gold surged to an unprecedented record. This divergence occurred amidst a stock sell-off and rising bond yields, fueled by concerns over the legality of President Trump's global tariffs and the possibility of the U.S. having to repay collected duties. Market strategists suggest gold's performance is driven by rate-cut expectations, a weaker dollar, and geopolitical uncertainty. Bitcoin, while benefiting from similar factors, has also contended with a significant rotation into Ethereum during the third quarter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anticipation is high for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September 2025, with a 90% chance predicted by the CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, experts suggest that this expected 25-basis-point reduction may only have a marginal initial impact on mortgage rates. Lenders often preemptively price in such cuts, meaning current rates may already reflect the upcoming change. Additionally, mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond just the federal funds rate, including the 10-year Treasury yield, necessitating a broader perspective for managing borrower expectations regarding significant declines.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing "Extra Value Meals" starting September 8, including a $5 Sausage and Egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal, to appeal to diners facing economic pressures. This move comes as the fast-food giant observes a decline in traffic among lower-income customers and sluggish breakfast sales, attributed to elevated inflation. Other companies, like Constellation Brands, are also reporting reduced consumer spending. McDonald's aims to boost sales by offering more affordable options, building on previous value initiatives like the McValue menu and the return of the Snack Wrap.</p>

Pegula expressed newfound comfort in high-stakes Grand Slam matches, a sentiment she never anticipated a decade ago. She capitalized on Krejcikova's slow start and poor serving, consistently hitting deep groundstrokes and attacking the net. Despite some service wobbles in the second set, Pegula maintained her composure to close out the match, having yet to drop a set in the tournament. She now awaits the winner of the match between Aryna Sabalenka and Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

          <p>Gregor Townsend has signed a contract extension to remain as Scotland's head coach until the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia. Townsend, who began his tenure in 2017, is already the longest-serving international coach in the professional era for Scotland. Despite notable victories, including first wins in Paris and Twickenham in decades, his critics point to a lack of tangible success, with no Six Nations titles and two pool-stage exits in World Cups. The extended contract, however, positions Scotland favorably for the new 24-nation World Cup format, where they will be seeded second in their group.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst has officially announced she will not seek reelection in 2026 after serving two terms in the Senate. Ernst, 55, made history as the first woman to represent Iowa in the Senate and the first female combat veteran in the upper chamber. Her decision opens up a competitive Senate seat in Iowa, a state President Trump won by a significant margin in 2024. Democrats hope to gain ground, with a crowded field already emerging, while Republicans speculate on potential candidates like Representative Ashley Hinson.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% capital gains tax under President Trump's new "big beautiful bill." The legislation's added deductions for 2025, including a temporary $6,000 deduction for older Americans, could enable more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains bracket. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting"—selling profitable assets in lower-income years—or resetting cost basis to reduce future tax liabilities. Investors are advised to consider these strategies within their broader financial and legacy planning. (not investment advice)</p>

They also aim to improve patient outcomes through value-based care contracts and shared specialists.

          <p>Despite stable consumer spending and shrinking traditional bank balances, Americans are hoarding more cash by moving funds into higher-yield accounts like money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). JPMorgan Chase's analysis reveals a 3% to 5% annual growth in total cash reserves, with the lowest-income households showing the biggest gains. This shift indicates a strategic adaptation to economic pressures, including inflation and market volatility, as households seek better returns than conventional checking or savings accounts. The trend suggests a focus on preserving and growing cash reserves through more lucrative financial tools. (not investment advice)</p>
