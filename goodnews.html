          <p>NASA has identified a new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, which originated from outside our solar system, marking only the third such interstellar visitor ever detected. The object was spotted by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles from Earth, posing no threat. This discovery offers a rare opportunity for scientists to study material from another star system. Astronomers anticipate finding many more interstellar objects with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to begin a decade-long survey of the sky.</p>

          <p>As families plan for the 2025-26 academic year, they face a choice between federal and private student loans, each with distinct interest rates. For the upcoming year, new federal undergraduate loans will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, while private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer substantial savings for those who qualify, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts advise students to start with federal loans but to compare private options if they have a strong credit profile or a qualified co-signer.</p>

          <p>Universal has submitted planning documents for its proposed UK theme park in Bedford, revealing ambitions to build some of Europe's tallest rides. The plans suggest structures could reach up to 377 feet (115m), surpassing the current tallest ride in Europe, to create a competitive and visually interesting skyline. The resort, aiming for an opening by 2031, expects to attract 8.5 million visitors annually and will include hotels, restaurants, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades. The company is seeking a special development order to bypass local planning and get direct government approval.</p>

This early access gives CoreWeave, a smaller competitor to giants like Amazon and Microsoft, a key market advantage.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a 10-year plan to reform England's National Health Service (NHS), emphasizing a shift from hospitals to community-based care and prevention. The strategy includes creating up to 300 neighborhood health hubs, launching an "obesity moonshot" with digital incentives, and expanding access to dental and mental health services. It also aims to enhance the NHS app to provide patients with more direct control over their health records and appointments. Critics have raised concerns about funding, staffing, and the plan's lack of focus on the interconnected social care sector.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to further scale back the Right to Buy scheme in England to protect the social housing supply. Under the new plans, newly built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants must live in a property for at least ten years to qualify, up from three. The maximum discounts available to tenants will also be significantly reduced. The Labour government stated these changes will help local authorities build new homes, while Conservative opponents criticized the move as an "attack on aspiration" and home ownership.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea in the 2022 University of Idaho murders, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that solved the case. Investigators used a combination of cell phone tracking, which placed Kohberger near the crime scene multiple times before the stabbings, and surveillance footage of his car. The critical breakthrough came from DNA found on a knife sheath left at the scene, which was matched to Kohberger through a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash. In exchange for the plea, Kohberger will receive four consecutive life sentences and avoid the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations despite ongoing trade tensions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%. Job growth was concentrated in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. The positive report comes amid economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs, with the White House downplaying their impact and pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to further stimulate the economy.
