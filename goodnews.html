          <h2>Clinical Trial Reveals Mounjaro More Effective Than Wegovy for Weight Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 20:00:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has found that Mounjaro is more effective, resulting in a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that suppress appetite, but Mounjaro mimics two hormones while Wegovy mimics only one. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, involved obese participants and showed that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and improved blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. While both drugs are considered good options, doctors suggest Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a long-standing dispute. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. Following its theft, a South Korean temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, leading to legal battles. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, facilitating the return. This event marks a positive step in easing tensions between the two countries.</p>

This technology bypasses spinal cord injuries, sending signals wirelessly from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord.

Clinical trials are underway to assess safety and efficacy, with the goal of making the therapy widely accessible.</p>
