          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing significantly, with its structure now weathertight ahead of a scheduled mid-2026 opening for its first phase. As part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of the entire airport, this new terminal will be JFK's largest and will be dedicated solely to international travelers, featuring a design intended to be flooded with natural light. The project also includes a resilient independent microgrid for power, unique cash-and-carry duty-free shopping, and improved roadway access to the airport. Its opening is strategically timed to coincide with the 2026 World Cup, which will hold games in the nearby New Jersey area.</p>

          <p>American swimmer Katie Ledecky captured her seventh world title in the 800-meter freestyle, making her the first swimmer in history to win the same event seven times at the world championships. In a highly anticipated final in Singapore, the 28-year-old clocked a championship-record 8:05.62, narrowly defeating Australia’s Lani Pallister and Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh. Ledecky maintained her undefeated 11-0 record in global 800m freestyle finals, a streak dating back to the 2012 Olympics. This victory marks her 23rd career world title, bringing her closer to Michael Phelps' record of 26, and further cements her legacy as one of the sport's all-time greats.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are turning up the heat by introducing dozens of new spicy menu items in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold and adventurous flavors. With around 95% of restaurants now offering at least one spicy option, companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes as a low-cost, high-return strategy to boost engagement amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests generate significant buzz. The strategy reflects a broader industry move to cater to diverse, younger palates that are increasingly drawn to global flavor profiles.</p>

          <p>After a foot surgery led to debilitating, constant pain, Amber Meade spent nearly a year searching for a diagnosis before learning she had chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. The condition, which can occur after an injury or surgery, causes extreme pain signals, swelling, and changes in skin color and temperature, making even the lightest touch unbearable. After multiple unsuccessful treatments, Meade found a specialized physical therapist and a multi-pronged approach involving physical therapy, relaxation exercises, medication, and ketamine infusions. While not a cure, this comprehensive treatment has significantly reduced her pain, allowing her to regain functionality and improve her quality of life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The ruling supports the finding that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration appeared to be unconstitutionally based on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. This decision stems from a lawsuit over high-profile raids in June that targeted locations like car washes and tow yards, causing widespread fear in the region's Latino community. The court's order reinforces that basing arrests on such broad profiles violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, named Endeavour, successfully docked with the International Space Station, delivering a new four-person crew for a long-duration mission. The Crew-11 mission includes two NASA astronauts, Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, alongside Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Their arrival brings the station's total crew to eleven members temporarily, ahead of the departure of the outgoing Crew-10 astronauts next week. This mission comes as NASA considers extending crew stays from the typical six months to eight, a potential move to reduce costs amid proposed budget cuts for the ISS program.</p>

          <h2>Surgeons Explain Neobladder Reconstruction Procedure Following Deion Sanders' Cancer Treatment</h2>

          <p>Following pro football hall of famer Deion Sanders' recent surgery for bladder cancer, medical experts are explaining the complex procedure he underwent, known as neobladder reconstruction. The surgery involves removing the patient's cancerous bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of their own small intestine. This new, sphere-like organ is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the neobladder is made from the patient's own tissue, there is no risk of rejection, but it lacks the nerves to signal the brain when full, requiring patients to learn a new bathroom schedule. Sanders has been praised for openly discussing the challenge of incontinence, helping to reduce the stigma associated with the condition.</p>

          <p>Over three years since Russia's full-scale invasion, more than five million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad, but a significant number hope to eventually return. A recent survey found 43% of Ukrainians living overseas wish to go back, though the primary obstacle remains the ongoing war and lack of security. Organizations are working to support the more than one million who have already returned and are preparing for a future influx, addressing challenges like housing, employment, and mental health services for returnees. For many, like Iryna Schestova who returned to Kyiv, the difficulty of integrating into a new society and the deep connection to their homeland outweigh the risks of living in a country at war.</p>

          <p>The American-made animated Netflix film 'K-pop Demon Hunters' has become a massive global success, resonating particularly strongly in South Korea for its authentic and detailed portrayal of Korean culture. The movie, which follows a K-pop girl group that fights evil, is filled with nuanced references to Korean folklore, history, pop culture, and even everyday mannerisms that have delighted local audiences. Its popularity highlights the increasingly fluid boundaries of the "K-wave," demonstrating how non-Korean and diaspora creators can contribute to and enrich the genre.

          <p>After a grim diagnosis left him in dire need of a kidney transplant, 66-year-old Jim Irish discovered an incredibly rare donor match: his wife, Mirna. Jim's kidney function had dropped dramatically following complications from a procedure, and the couple faced the prospect of a long and uncertain wait on the national transplant list. Mirna immediately offered to be tested, and against odds of roughly 1-in-100,000, she was found to be a strong genetic match. After overcoming further health hurdles, including a cancerous tumor on his remaining kidney, Jim is scheduled to receive his wife's kidney, a gift she calls a blessing to give to the love of her life.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted decisively to unionize, joining a growing wave of labor organizing in the coffee industry. Workers at three Oakland locations and one in Berkeley voted 22-to-5 to join the Blue Bottle Independent Union. This independent union previously organized six stores in the Boston area and is focused on securing higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and greater transparency from the Nestlé-owned company. The successful vote reflects a broader trend of unionization efforts at chains like Starbucks, as service workers seek a greater voice in their working conditions.</p>

          <p>Several elderly residents who lost their homes or were displaced by the devastating fire in Pacific Palisades are now adapting to a new life at the Avocet retirement community in Playa Vista. For couples like Joe and Arline Halper, who had planned to live in their Palisades home indefinitely, the transition to communal living has been a significant adjustment, but one with unexpected benefits. They have found a warm, friendly, and social environment that combats isolation, along with amenities like fitness centers and on-site care. While some still grapple with the loss of their former independence, they are making the best of their unscheduled reinvention and finding a supportive community in which to restart.</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments from a Philadelphia 76ers executive and others who have questioned the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that winning the title inside the COVID-19 "bubble" was not easier, but required immense courage, mental fortitude, and resilience from players who were isolated from their families during a global pandemic. The piece emphasizes that the unique and challenging circumstances, including daily testing and the loss of home-court advantage, should be honored rather than discounted. The author concludes that viewing the championship with an asterisk is a product of jealousy and disrespect for what the team accomplished during one of modern history's most difficult periods.</p>
