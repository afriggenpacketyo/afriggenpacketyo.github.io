          <p>Following the death of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, UFC President Dana White shared a personal memory of the icon from the Republican National Convention. White recounted a private conversation with Hogan, describing him as a "good man" who loved America and the president. He also acknowledged Hogan's significant influence, alongside figures like Muhammad Ali, in shaping the combat sports and sports entertainment landscape that paved the way for the UFC's success. The tribute highlights Hogan's impact beyond the wrestling ring and into the broader world of sports and politics.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Observe Quantum Friction Effect for the First Time in Graphene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe quantum friction between solid surfaces. The groundbreaking experiment, conducted using folded graphene, revealed that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The discovery could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the United States, with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2023. This explosive growth, driven by affordable housing just north of Dallas, has created significant growing pains for the once-small town. The city had to implement a temporary halt on new construction to allow essential infrastructure like sewer lines, water, and roads to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is racing to manage its expansion and is projected to reach 100,000 residents within five years.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders on a new stadium agreement, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block it. Trump had stated he would not approve a deal unless the NFL team reverted to its former "Redskins" name. The council chairman characterized the president's comments as an unhelpful distraction. The proposal, which aims to bring the team back to the RFK Stadium site, includes significant revenue benefits for the district and is set for a crucial vote on August 1.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but instead sent digitally to a specialized facility in Salt Lake City. At this Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of expert employees, known as keyers, work around the clock to decipher images of the illegible addresses. The center processes images of approximately 75,000 challenging pieces of mail daily from a local distribution hub alone, ensuring that even the most poorly addressed letters can reach their intended destinations.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from the Los Angeles Times explores the profound and lasting influence of Hulk Hogan, who died at 71, on modern popular culture. The piece argues that Hogan pioneered the brand of celebrity that has become mainstream, from reality television stardom to leveraging a combative, patriotic persona for mass appeal. It credits him with transforming professional wrestling into a global phenomenon and setting the template for personality-driven careers. The article also examines his more controversial moments, including a lawsuit that bankrupted a media outlet and scandals involving racist language, framing him as a complex cultural architect.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a program to deliver hot meals, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. The initiative aims to support families across its nearly 300 parishes in three counties as widespread arrests by ICE have instilled fear in the community. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many hard-working people are now afraid to go to work or be seen in public. The program has already received significant donations, including a $50,000 contribution from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and pop star Renée Rapp addressed her reputation for being unfiltered and outspoken during media appearances. The 25-year-old, known for her role in the "Mean Girls" movie, explained that she finds traditional media training boring and prefers authentic conversations. While the online attention to her candid personality initially made her insecure, she has since embraced it, even referencing it in her new single "Leave Me Alone." Rapp also discussed her new album "Bite Me," which she says was born from a period of depression and overwork last year.</p>

          <p>Four former traders convicted of rigging the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The men were all prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office for manipulating the key interest rate for profit in a scandal that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. The successful appeal of Hayes and Palombo, who argued they were following normal commercial practices, is expected to simplify the appeal process for the other four.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats are already making strategic media appearances, signaling the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential primary campaign. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with nontraditional and ideologically diverse outlets, a shift from previous campaign strategies. This new approach appears aimed at reaching a broader electorate and addressing perceptions that the party has become too extreme. The maneuvering reflects an effort to fill a leadership vacuum and begin a course correction following the party's 2024 election loss, with candidates already shaping their messages on contentious cultural issues.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Big Tech Is Underspending on Artificial Intelligence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies are underspending, not overspending, on artificial intelligence, framing the current technological race as a "winner-take-all" situation. He pointed to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both urgent and necessary for future dominance. While acknowledging skepticism due to current chatbot inaccuracies, Cramer believes the technology will improve as companies invest in more advanced hardware. He argues the company that develops the most accurate AI will achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banning Red Dye No. 3 and phasing out other petroleum-based food colorings, tech firms and food giants are racing to develop natural alternatives. Companies like French firm Fermentalg are using microalgae to create stable, vivid pigments like Galdieria blue, which was recently approved by the FDA. Major brands including Kellogg's, Nestle, and Kraft Heinz have pledged to reformulate their products to eliminate artificial colors by 2026. The shift presents challenges, as natural colors can be more expensive and have a shorter shelf life than their synthetic counterparts.</p>
