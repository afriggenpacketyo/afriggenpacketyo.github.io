          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, driven by a tech rally on Wall Street following a significant deal between AMD and OpenAI. Despite the initial surge, the index later pared its gains to close flat. Chip-related stocks experienced volatile trading, while Japanese Government Bond yields also rose to their highest levels in years. The market's performance reflects investor optimism in the tech sector, though some volatility indicates underlying caution among traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center in the seas off Hainan province, a project designed to leverage the ocean for natural cooling. The facility consists of 1,300-tonne data cabins submerged 35 meters deep, which significantly reduces the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based centers. This initiative is a key part of Hainan's strategic plan to develop its "blue economy" by pioneering new marine technologies. Each cabin can house hundreds of servers to manage a wide range of digital services.</p>

          <p>An innovative exhibition is bringing together historical artefacts recovered from a Tang dynasty shipwreck with Western art, creating a unique cultural dialogue. The project, inspired by a Monet painting of merchant ships, aims to highlight the borderless nature of art and maritime culture. The collection features items from an ancient Chinese sailboat, illustrating how goods and ideas have journeyed across the globe for centuries. The curator emphasizes that just as ships travel between ports, these cultural artefacts travel through different places, sharing their stories and inspiring new perspectives.</p>

The former Leicester City defender acknowledged that her choice "deeply hurt" people who felt she was representing something that devalued them, but she also seeks to challenge Western preconceptions about life in Saudi Arabia. Plumptre, one of the first major players to move to the league, described feeling safe in Jeddah and emphasized that her decision was based on the project's vision rather than just finances.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its economic growth forecast for China in 2025 to 4.8%, a notable increase from its previous 4% prediction, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The revision reflects the positive impact of government stimulus measures and resilient export performance, which have helped offset a domestic property slump and weak consumer spending. However, the bank projects that China's growth will slow to 4.2% in 2026 as the effects of the stimulus fade and export momentum eases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese automaker BYD has announced that its UK sales surged by 880% in September compared to the previous year, making Britain its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model, boosting its UK market share to 3.6%. This rapid growth is attributed to the brand's competitively priced models and the absence of the high tariffs that Chinese EVs face in the EU and US markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens have been released into Exmoor National Park as part of a major conservation effort. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project successfully introduced nineteen of the mammals, relocated from Scotland, to secret locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and integration into the ecosystem. Conservationists have hailed their return as a positive sign for nature restoration, as pine martens play a critical role in balancing woodland wildlife.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to announce a lower-cost version of its best-selling Model Y SUV as the company looks to reinvigorate sales and counter growing competition in the global electric vehicle market. CEO Elon Musk has previously indicated the vehicle would be priced below $30,000, including tax credits, to make it accessible to a wider range of consumers. The move comes as Tesla faces challenges from an aging product lineup and increased competition, particularly in China and Europe, leading to a decline in its market share.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial seventh-inning comeback to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-3, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive. A series of smart at-bats and aggressive baserunning, highlighted by three two-out RBIs, allowed them to score four runs and silence the Philadelphia crowd. The victory puts the Dodgers just one win away from advancing to the NL Championship Series.</p>

The reborn establishment was fully booked with reservations on its opening day, drawing fans from as far as Ohio who came to relive nostalgic memories. Originally founded in Minnesota in 1975, the chain disappeared after facing bankruptcy and a hepatitis A outbreak in 2004. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which owns the brand's trademark.</p>

          <p>The European Union has weighed in on the dispute over United Nations Resolution 2758, stating that the 1971 document only addressed the issue of China's representation and does not mention Taiwan. This statement supports the position of Taiwan and the U.S. against China's assertion that the resolution provides a legal basis for its sovereignty claims over the island. The EU emphasized that the resolution switched representation from Taipei to Beijing but did not determine Taiwan's political status, urging China to uphold international law and refrain from the use of force.</p>
