        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is actively considering new regulations to tackle the substantial issue of food waste, particularly prevalent in hotel all-you-can-eat buffets and traditional large breakfasts. The country's Presidential Council for Agriculture and Food Policy is developing proposals, driven by data indicating Turkey discards 8.7 million tons of food annually, with an average of 102 kilograms wasted per person. Experts criticize the current system for leading to significant waste of food, resources, and energy. Suggested reforms include enabling guests to customize breakfast selections and implementing flexible pricing to align portions with actual consumption, though some tourism stakeholders remain wary, citing potential conflicts of interest and the economic importance of popular all-inclusive offerings.</p>

          <p>Kira Chathli, a 26-year-old county player, has become an unexpected star in The Hundred women's cricket competition, despite not being selected in the initial draft. Joining London Spirit as a replacement, Chathli has scored 160 runs at a remarkable strike-rate in six matches, attributing her improved performance to enhanced physical strength from gym training and better grip. The chemistry graduate and co-founder of a cricket coaching academy for young girls also credits her fearless approach and tactical insights to experiences like rock-climbing and chess. Her recent achievements, including a career-high T20 Cup score and her first Hundred fifty, signify a pivotal moment in her evolving cricket journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mission Viejo secured a hard-fought 7-3 high school football victory against Santa Margarita in an intense defensive battle. The game's sole touchdown came late in the third quarter from Ohio State-bound quarterback Luke Fahey, who connected with Jack Junker for a 33-yard pass, overcoming a 3-0 deficit. Fahey's agility and strategic play were crucial, as he completed 16 of 22 passes for 169 yards while navigating Santa Margarita's aggressive defensive line. The low-scoring affair, characterized by robust defensive efforts from both teams, was ultimately decided in the final seconds when Santa Margarita's last-ditch effort on fourth down fell incomplete. This triumph underscores Mission Viejo's tenacity and the high level of competition in Southern Section Division 1.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. These jurisdictions maintain policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts, which the Trump administration aimed to penalize as part of its broader strategy to deport undocumented immigrants. The judge characterized the administration's executive orders and related actions as an unconstitutional "coercive threat" against local governments. This ruling represents a significant legal defeat for the administration's stringent immigration enforcement agenda, underscoring the ongoing legal and political conflicts between federal and local authorities regarding immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a 2-1 defeat against the San Diego Padres, consequently losing their outright lead in the National League West and dropping back into a tie for first place. Despite a stellar seven-inning pitching performance from Blake Snell, the Dodgers' offense struggled, managing only three hits, with rookie Alex Freeland contributing their only run via a home run. The Padres strategically capitalized on critical opportunities, including an RBI single and a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, to clinch the victory. This loss extends a recent period of inconsistency for the Dodgers, who had recently swept the Padres, highlighting their ongoing challenges in building late-season momentum.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Restricts Rare Earth Exports, Boosting Local Industry and US Supply Hopes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 22:00:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia has enacted a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, signaling a strategic move to foster its domestic downstream industry and potentially emerge as a crucial non-Chinese supplier for the mineral-intensive United States. This policy is designed to retain valuable raw materials within the country, thereby attracting foreign investment that incorporates local processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts suggest Malaysia is favorably positioned to integrate into global supply chains, given its existing processing infrastructure and the urgent demand from the U.S. for alternative rare earth sources amid its strained relationship with China. This initiative underscores Malaysia's assertion of geoeconomic agency and its potential to influence global mineral supply chain diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong Surpasses US as Primary IPO Venue for Chinese Start-ups</h2>

          <p>Hong Kong has notably surpassed the United States as the preferred venue for Chinese companies seeking initial public offerings (IPOs) during the first eight months of 2025. In this period, 46 Chinese firms successfully raised a combined $16.5 billion through listings in Hong Kong, a stark contrast to the 16 Chinese listings in the U.S. which generated only $740.9 million. New shares in Hong Kong have demonstrated an impressive average debut jump of 19.4%, significantly outperforming their U.S. counterparts. This shift is largely attributed to Hong Kong's more dynamic capital market, signs of economic recovery, and escalating US-China rivalry, which creates substantial delisting risks and regulatory uncertainties for Chinese companies listed in America.
