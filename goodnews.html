          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with a series of events spanning four days, from May 5th to 8th. Commemorations will include a military procession in London featuring over 1,300 armed forces members, culminating in a flypast by the Red Arrows and other military aircraft. King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony and host a tea party for war veterans. Additionally, street parties are planned nationwide, and the Tower of London will unveil an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, remembering those who served in World War II.</p>

          <p>The town of Chelsea, Michigan, came together to help Serendipity Books relocate to a larger space by forming a human chain to move approximately 9,000 books. Faced with the challenge of transporting her vast collection, bookstore owner Michelle Tuplin enlisted the help of the community, resulting in over 300 volunteers participating in the book brigade. Residents of Chelsea expressed their desire for community engagement, viewing the event as a unifying experience in a divided country. The move restored Tuplin's faith in humanity, highlighting the inherent goodness and willingness of people to support one another.</p>

          <p>Saturday's British newspapers are dominated by two key stories: Reform UK's performance in local elections and a BBC interview with Prince Harry regarding his security in the UK. Publications such as The Daily Mail and The Times highlight the "Reform revolution" after Nigel Farage's party gained council seats and mayoralties. The Daily Telegraph features Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's reaction to the election results, while the Daily Express focuses on Prince Harry's "bombshell interview" and Princess Charlotte's birthday. The Financial Times stands apart by prioritizing the election results, describing Reform UK's victories as a "populist insurgency."</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, triggering a brief tsunami warning. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for coastal areas, including the Strait of Magellan and Antarctic areas, but the warning was later withdrawn. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Drake Passage, and it was felt in Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were suspended. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties, and evacuations proceeded calmly.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election, with the Labor party holding a slight edge over the conservative opposition in opinion polls. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty, exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is seeking a second term, promising tax cuts and affordable healthcare, while opposition leader Peter Dutton is advocating for fuel tax cuts and nuclear energy investments. Polls suggest a potential minority government, with independent and minor parties gaining traction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to stop freezing funds to Maine schools, settling a dispute over the state's support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills sued the USDA to maintain funding, resulting in a settlement that restores the funds. The agreement does not affect another ongoing lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the Maine Department of Education over its policy for trans athletes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell determined that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. The ruling is the first summary judgment in a series of cases brought by law firms penalized by the president for their associations with disfavored people and causes. Howell characterized the executive order as a deliberate attempt to harm Perkins Coie for its legal work and Mr. Trump's "grievances."</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck in Florida's Pensacola Bay may represent the earliest evidence of cats in what is now the United States. The cats, an adult and a juvenile, were found in the wreckage of the Emanuel Point II, a Spanish conquistador ship that sank in 1559. Analysis suggests the adult cat primarily consumed fish and possibly domestic meat, rather than relying on rats for food. Cats were likely brought to the Americas by Europeans for pest control and were also considered lucky by sailors.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in Friede's blood that target neurotoxins, creating an antivenom cocktail that protected mice against fatal doses from 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

          <p>Research has revealed that a man who injected himself with snake venom for years has blood that could "revolutionize" snakebite treatment. Immunologist Jacob Glanville worked with Tim Friede, who had exposed himself to snake venom over 18 years, developing immunity to several neurotoxins. Scientists isolated antibodies from Friede‚Äôs blood that reacted with neurotoxins found within 19 snake species. The antivenom offered mice 100% protection against the venom for 13 species and partial protection (20% to 40%) for the remaining six. Experts say the human origin of the antibodies would likely mean fewer side effects than traditional antivenoms.</p>
