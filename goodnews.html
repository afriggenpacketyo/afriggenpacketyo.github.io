          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants was unlawful. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen found the process was rushed and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. This ruling effectively reinstates the protections, which shield migrants from deportation and provide work permits, unless it is overturned on appeal. The Justice Department is expected to challenge the decision, which addresses a key immigration policy of the administration.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated he will not withdraw from the mayoral race, despite reports that President Trump's advisors considered offering him an ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia. Adams, who is running as an independent after facing federal corruption charges that were later dropped, affirmed his commitment to his campaign. The political landscape is complex, with President Trump suggesting that a consolidated opposition could better challenge the Democratic front-runner, Zohran Mamdani. Adams' decision maintains a multi-candidate field in the high-profile election.</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic has agreed to a settlement of at least $1.5 billion to resolve a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged the company illegally used their copyrighted books to train its AI models. According to the court filing, the company will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has agreed to destroy the datasets that contained the pirated material. The case has been closely watched as a bellwether for copyright infringement in the age of generative AI. If approved, this would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, sending a strong message to other AI developers.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, Giorgio Armani is being remembered not only as a legendary designer but also as a brilliant businessman who built a multi-billion-dollar global empire. Experts highlight his masterful consistency in vision, creating a brand synonymous with "quiet luxury" that was accessible yet elegant. He revolutionized professional attire with the deconstructed power suit for men and later adapted it for women, tapping into the feminist movement of the era. By maintaining independent control of his company and pioneering the use of celebrity endorsements, Armani fundamentally changed how fashion is marketed and managed.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.7 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Residents of Massachusetts spend the most, averaging $915 per person annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. According to the report, lottery sales can be a substantial source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general funds and as much as 3% in some states. The data highlights regional differences in participation in games of chance.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated claims that Chicago is a "killing field," an examination of official crime statistics presents a more nuanced picture. According to FBI data from 2024, Chicago's violent crime rate was down 11% from the previous year and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While the city did have the highest total number of homicides, its homicide rate per capita was tenth among large cities. The article notes that crime data can be complex and that different metrics can lead to different conclusions, cautioning against using statistics for simple rankings.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the sharp tone of her written response to a dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that Jackson had made a "spirited argument" that "merited a spirited response," emphasizing that their disagreements are about legal ideas, not personal animosity. She quoted her former mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia, saying, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people." Barrett dismissed any notion of a personal conflict, stating that the justices can debate vigorously while maintaining collegial relationships.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. tech companies added a combined $420 billion in market capitalization this week, pushing their total value to $21 trillion. The surge was led by a more than 10% weekly gain for Alphabet after a federal judge issued a less severe than expected remedy in its antitrust case, declining to force the sale of its Chrome browser. The ruling, which also benefited Apple by preserving its lucrative search deal with Google, was seen as a major relief for the tech giants. These eight companies now account for an unprecedented 36% of the entire S&P 500's market value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has imposed a €2.95 billion fine on Google for violating EU competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that the tech giant illegally favored its own ad exchange, AdX, over rivals, which harmed competitors and publishers by increasing their costs and reducing their revenues. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, while President Trump criticized the fine as "very unfair" to an American company. This is the third time the EU has fined Google for anticompetitive behavior, and regulators warned the company may need to sell parts of its ad tech business.</p>

This work is part of a broader modernization program intended to make the airport more efficient ahead of hosting the World Cup in 2026 and the Summer Olympics in 2028.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. The sharp decline breaks a months-long period where rates were stuck in a higher range, offering immediate relief to prospective homebuyers facing high prices. For a buyer of a median-priced home, the drop could translate into a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains to be seen whether this reduction will be enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as overall affordability and economic uncertainty remain major concerns.

          <p>In response to the resignation of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to recast his government. The shake-up includes new appointments to two of the most senior positions, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. The move is seen as an attempt by Starmer to seize a moment of crisis and re-energize his administration, which has faced declining approval ratings. By making such significant changes rather than a simple replacement, the prime minister is asserting his authority and setting a new course for his government.</p>
