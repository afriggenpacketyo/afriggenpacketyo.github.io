          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that no decision has been made for the September meeting, citing concerns over the inflationary impact of tariffs.

          <p>This article examines the potential interest earnings from a $10,000 deposit in a high-yield savings account amid the current elevated rate environment. While traditional savings accounts offer minimal returns, high-yield options provide significantly better rates, with some examples showing potential annual earnings over $400 on a $10,000 balance. The article stresses that these accounts have variable rates that can change with market conditions, unlike the fixed rates of CDs. It presents these accounts as a flexible and potentially lucrative option for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.37%, while the 2-year yield also saw an increase. The market movement reflects investor reaction to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments about potential inflation from tariffs and the robust GDP growth of 3%, which surpassed economists' forecasts.

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now estimating a net $2 billion negative impact from the import taxes. The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, reaching $50.2 billion. Despite a net loss related to a recall and a canceled EV program, its commercial business showed strong growth. CEO Jim Farley credited the company's turnaround plan, while the CFO noted ongoing, constructive conversations with the Trump administration regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs affecting the industry.

Recruitment specialists believe his physical attributes make him well-suited for the Premier League, though a move this summer remains uncertain due to the high transfer fee.</p>

As of late July 2025, average rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.26%. The article explains the key differences between the two products: home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, whereas HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit.

          <p>Shares of life sciences company Danaher have rallied following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report, but analysts remain cautious about the stock's long-term prospects. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, tariff impacts, and reduced biotech spending. While Danaher raised its full-year earnings guidance, it did not increase its revenue growth outlook, citing ongoing uncertainty. An RBC analyst suggests a sustained rally for the sector is unlikely until it returns to mid-single-digit revenue growth, which may still be a few quarters away. (not investment advice)</p>

During September and October, thousands of mature male tarantulas, which can be the size of a baseball, emerge from their burrows to search for females. Although their appearance and reputation are intimidating, the spiders are generally timid and will not bite unless provoked. The males typically die within a year of mating, while females can live for over two decades.</p>

The proposed act would require lawmakers to divest their individual stock holdings and provide annual certification of compliance. The move reflects growing public pressure for stricter ethics rules, though it is unclear if the bill will receive a full vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

While waves were observed in Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast, with some minor flooding and surges in harbors, there were no reports of major damage or injuries. Authorities in Hawaii allowed evacuated residents to return home, cautioning them about potentially strong currents. The event, which prompted widespread evacuations, ultimately did not produce the catastrophic waves that were anticipated.</p>
