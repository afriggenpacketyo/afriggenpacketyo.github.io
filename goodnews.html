          <p>The Kremlin has announced that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to meet in the coming days, although a specific date and location have not yet been set. According to a Putin adviser, the summit is in the planning stages and will be a bilateral meeting, despite a suggestion for a trilateral talk including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The announcement follows a meeting between a White House envoy and Putin, which Trump described as "highly productive" in advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine. This development occurs as a deadline approaches for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire or face new U.S. sanctions.</p>

She will be part of a nearly full-strength lineup facing France on Saturday, after having missed the Six Nations match against the same opponent due to a leg injury. The team sees 11 changes from its recent decisive victory over Spain, with Zoe Harrison continuing at fly-half and Zoe Aldcroft returning to captain the side from the back row.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 05:11:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million (53m euros). The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is expected to undergo a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64 million but started in only eight Premier League matches during the team's title-winning season last year. The sale would provide Liverpool with a significant financial boost, potentially aiding their pursuit of Newcastle's Alexander Isak, for whom they recently had a £110 million offer rejected.</p>

          <p>In response to a query about resisting consumer urges, people have shared various personal strategies for avoiding unnecessary purchases. Common tactics include delaying gratification by leaving items in an online cart for a period or adding them to a temporary wish list to see if the desire fades. Other creative solutions involve redirecting the shopping impulse, such as visiting a library to get the thrill of acquisition without spending money or browsing thrift stores for low-cost finds. These tips emphasize mindfulness and intention, encouraging consumers to question whether a purchase is a genuine need or a reaction to marketing pressure.</p>

          <p>The tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) has transformed from a private pastime into a major form of spectator entertainment, with live-play shows selling out arenas like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as "actual play," features comedians and actors playing the game for millions of online viewers, fueling a new golden age for D&D. The popularity of shows like "Dimension 20" and "Critical Role" is attributed to their diverse casts and the relatable, friendly dynamic between players, which resonated strongly with audiences during the pandemic. This mainstream success is also encouraging more people than ever to start their own D&D groups.</p>

          <p>The National Football League has banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing safety concerns and a recent FDA warning about their unproven effectiveness. Smelling salts, made of ammonium carbonate, trigger an involuntary inhalation reflex that increases heart rate and alertness, but the league noted this effect can mask the symptoms of a concussion. Inappropriate use of the substance can also cause a sudden jolt of the head and neck, potentially worsening an existing injury. While some players have expressed disappointment, the NFL's decision aligns with bans in other sports organizations like the International Boxing Federation.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase taxes on the gambling industry to fund the removal of benefit restrictions, such as the two-child cap. Brown described the proposal as the most cost-effective way to address the nation's "social crisis" and lift children out of poverty ahead of the autumn Budget. He is backing a plan from the IPPR think tank to raise an additional £3.2 billion annually by targeting online gambling firms. The Betting and Gaming Council has pushed back, calling the plan "economically reckless" and warning it could drive gamblers to the unregulated black market.</p>

The collaboration was discussed during a meeting between Pakistani officials and the heads of China's nuclear and space agencies. This partnership builds on existing energy projects, such as the two Hualong One nuclear reactors China exported to a facility in Karachi. Each of these third-generation reactors is capable of generating over 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, showcasing the depth of the nations' strategic and technological ties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires intensify globally due to climate change, experts are promoting strategies to make forests more resilient. One key approach is converting flammable monocultures, like eucalyptus or pine plantations, back into natural, fire-resistant deciduous forests, though this is a long-term process. In the short term, reducing fuel loads through prescribed burning, mechanical clearing, or animal grazing is crucial. Other tactics include creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks to slow a fire's spread and planting green firebreaks of less flammable native trees around communities. Early detection through surveillance and ensuring rapid access to water for firefighting are also vital components of modern wildfire prevention.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has reported its second straight quarter of profit, largely driven by a significant $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund technology investment arm. The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen far exceeded analyst expectations, a stark contrast to the loss reported in the same period last year. The Vision Fund's strong performance was bolstered by gains in publicly traded companies like Grab and private investments in Indian firms. This positive result comes as SoftBank continues its aggressive spending spree on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and a proposed acquisition of AI chipmaker Ampere Computing.</p>

          <p>Police in Bavaria, Germany, have arrested three men suspected of belonging to the far-right "Reichsbürger" (Reich Citizens) terrorist group. The network rejects the legitimacy of the modern German state and allegedly planned to violently overthrow the constitutional order. The arrests followed raids on four properties across three states, where investigators believe the group conducted weapons training in preparation for a potential armed assault on the German parliament. This operation is part of a larger crackdown on the movement, with court proceedings against other key leaders already underway in several German cities.</p>

However, CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the United States is an exception, where uncertainty over tariffs has had a dampening effect on demand. The company's improved performance is also attributed to its continued focus on operational efficiency amid ongoing geopolitical volatility, including the persistent disruption in the Red Sea.</p>

The CEO of Deoleo, maker of brands like Bertolli, expressed cautious optimism for a more balanced market in the second half of the year.
