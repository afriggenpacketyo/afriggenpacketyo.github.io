          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining attractive in mid-2025, savers face a choice between short-term flexibility and long-term security. Financial experts suggest that one-year CDs are generally preferable for those needing liquidity soon, as they offer flexibility ahead of anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Conversely, five-year CDs can be a prudent choice for those with a longer time horizon, like individuals nearing retirement, who wish to lock in current high yields for a predictable income stream. The decision ultimately hinges on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI hyperscaler CoreWeave has announced it will acquire Core Scientific, a major data center infrastructure provider, in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is a strategic move for CoreWeave to strengthen its position in the competitive AI sector by bringing critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity, in-house. CoreWeave's CEO stated the acquisition will eliminate future lease obligations and improve operational efficiency. Following the news, CoreWeave's stock fell slightly, while Core Scientific's shares saw a significant drop, after both had rallied on earlier reports of the talks.</p>

Jakes, who will remain as chairman of the T.D. Jakes Foundation, announced the long-planned transition following a health incident in late 2024. The Potter's House, a non-denominational church with over 30,000 members, is one of the most influential churches in the United States. The move marks a significant leadership change for the prominent religious institution.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Extending Bereavement Leave to Cover Miscarriages Before 24 Weeks</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to extend statutory bereavement leave to include parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, which would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, is being hailed as a significant step forward in recognizing such losses as a form of bereavement rather than an illness requiring sick leave. Campaigners and advocates, including MP Sarah Owen and musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move for helping to break the taboo surrounding miscarriage.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, demonstrating empathy, and presenting a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication expert Lorraine K. Lee. This article analyzes the elements of successful and unsuccessful public apologies, noting that timing is critical; leaders should acknowledge a situation quickly and follow up with a thoughtful response. An apology can fail if it lacks genuine emotion, sounds rehearsed, or uses passive language that avoids ownership. Ultimately, people respond better to a leader who sounds human and vulnerable rather than one who is simply delivering a corporate-branded statement.</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team will not move wicketkeeper Jamie Smith up the batting order, despite his impressive recent scores at number seven. McCullum compared Smith's role to that of Australian legend Adam Gilchrist, emphasizing his value in his current position. The coach also dismissed the immediate prospect of bringing in Jacob Bethell as a spin-bowling all-rounder to replace Shoaib Bashir, stating Bethell is primarily considered a batting option. Meanwhile, pace bowler Jofra Archer is reportedly fit and likely to return for the third Test against India after a long injury layoff.</p>
