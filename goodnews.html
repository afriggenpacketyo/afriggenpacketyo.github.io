          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), urging the bloc to promote an “equal and orderly multipolar world.” He criticized hegemonism and power politics, stating that certain countries prioritize selfish interests over the international community. Wang called for the SCO to defend fairness, safeguard the rights of member states, and help build a more just global governance system, reinforcing the bloc's role beyond its original focus on regional security.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over the nation's school summer holiday calendar, which critics argue unfairly benefits the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These two states always begin their summer break last, allowing their residents to travel after the peak season rush. Other states are calling for an end to this exception and a move to a more equitable, rotational system, but southern leaders remain defiant.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont has reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan, as a strengthening yen has dampened spending by international tourists, especially from China. This marks a significant reversal from the previous year when a weak yen fueled a major luxury shopping boom. Despite the setback in Japan, the Cartier-owner's overall global revenues rose by 6%, driven by continued strong demand for its high-end jewelry brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has been fined 10% of their match fee and docked two crucial points in the World Test Championship for maintaining a slow over rate in their recent victory against India. The penalty, accepted by captain Ben Stokes, causes England to drop from second to third in the championship standings. This is not the first time this year that the team has been punished for failing to meet the required pace of play.</p>

          <p>An independent review for the NHS has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The report also advises that they should not diagnose patients and should wear standardized uniforms to distinguish them from doctors. The review was commissioned following growing concerns over the roles' responsibilities and patient safety, including several high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs.</p>
