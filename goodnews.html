          <p>Tesla stock experienced a rebound of over 3% following a significant drop fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, which resulted in a $152 billion decrease in the company's market capitalization. Analysts cited a Politico report suggesting Trump scheduled a call with Musk to resolve the conflict, but a White House official denied any interest from Trump in such a call. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes the stock is oversold due to the news, emphasizing the potential relief for Tesla shares if Musk and Trump reconcile. Musk had criticized Trump's tax and spending bill after his term as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency concluded.</p>

          <p>Dilly Dally, a loggerhead sea turtle, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after recovering from a predator attack that necessitated the amputation of her right front flipper. The Loggerhead Marinelife Center (LMC) celebrated her return, sharing a video of her swimming before her release. Dilly Dally had spent five months at the LMC, recovering from wound complications after the surgery. She joins other rehabilitated loggerheads in returning to the wild, and will be tracked via satellite to monitor her movements and adaptation. The LMC and other organizations work to protect sea turtles amid threats like poaching, fishing, and habitat degradation.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in west Texas is showing signs of decline, with no new cases reported in the latest update from the state's health services department. The total case count remains at 742, though officials warn that even one unvaccinated individual entering an under-vaccinated community can trigger another outbreak. Most cases have been concentrated in Gaines County, home to a Mennonite community with historically low immunization rates. Two unvaccinated children from the affected region have died from the disease, marking the first U.S. measles deaths since 2015.</p>

The order establishes a task force to detect and identify drones and crack down on unlawful uses like spying and drug smuggling, prioritizing airspace security for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The order aims to boost U.S. development and commercial use of drones, as well as encourage the development of supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs).

          <p>Amazon is investing in automating approximately $200 billion in logistics costs, which is equivalent to 35% of its online retail revenue, according to Morgan Stanley. This includes utilizing AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries, which would go directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans. The company is testing these robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. Analysts view humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of market share gains in Amazon's logistics network, projecting potential annual savings of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030.
