          <p>Two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning has announced a significant investment in XTech, a company that manufactures protective sports equipment. Manning, who used the company's shoulder pads during his career with the New York Giants, aims to support XTech's expansion from the professional and college markets into youth and high school sports. He plans to be an active partner, serving as a spokesperson and assisting with corporate strategy to promote safer equipment for young athletes. The company, which dominates the NFL market, was founded on the principle of creating lighter, more mobile, and safer shoulder pads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's central bank has cut its main interest rate by three percentage points, bringing it down to 43% in a return to monetary easing. This move, the first reduction since a hike in April, surprised some analysts but signals the bank's confidence in its strategy to combat inflation, which has been gradually decreasing. The bank stated that its tight monetary policy stance will continue to support disinflation by moderating domestic demand and improving inflation expectations. Analysts suggest that the pace of future rate cuts may slow as the year progresses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, for three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse at the Red Chris copper and gold mine. According to mine operator Newmont Corp, the workers are believed to be uninjured and have taken shelter in a designated refuge station. The station is equipped with sufficient food, water, and ventilation to sustain them for an extended period. A second collapse has further blocked their exit, and communication with the miners is currently restricted while rescue teams work to reach them.</p>

          <p>Amazon is backing Cambridge Terahertz, a startup that has developed a 3D imaging system capable of seeing inside unopened packages to combat return fraud. This costly scam, where customers return empty boxes or incorrect items, resulted in over $100 billion in retail losses last year. Amazon's $1 billion Industrial Innovation Fund participated in the startup's $12 million seed financing round. The technology, which shrinks airport-style scanners to a handheld device, could allow Amazon to efficiently screen returned inventory and verify contents before packages are shipped, aligning with the fund's goal of investing in solutions for its logistics network.</p>

          <h2>Strategists Suggest Investors Are Tolerating Tariffs for Now, But Volatility Is Expected</h2>

          <p>Despite initial market shocks from tariff announcements earlier in the year, investors currently appear comfortable with the prospect of continued import taxes, contributing to recent market gains. Experts suggest this resilience, combined with factors like deregulation and stimulative tax policy, could support further growth, though significant uncertainty remains. Strategists note that while the market has priced in mid-teen tariff rates, the true impact on corporate profits and consumer costs is still unclear. They warn that headlines will continue to create volatility and that a shift in sentiment could occur if high tariffs begin to visibly damage the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have officially signed a landmark free trade agreement, which is expected to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. The deal will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while Indian goods such as textiles and jewelry will become cheaper to import into the UK. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed it as the most significant trade deal since Brexit, projecting it will create over 2,200 British jobs.

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man accused of running a fake embassy near New Delhi, where he allegedly duped people by promising them overseas jobs and contracts. The suspect, Harshvardhan Jain, posed as an ambassador for non-existent micronations like "Seborga" and "Westarctica" to project diplomatic clout. During a raid on the property, investigators discovered luxury cars with fake diplomatic plates, doctored photos with world leaders, and counterfeit passports. Authorities also recovered significant amounts of cash and suspect Jain was involved in money laundering through international shell companies.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering engineering feat in China's Yunnan province, a fleet of 16 drones has successfully transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete up a mountain to build three electricity transmission towers. The autonomous drones completed the task in just three days, a massive efficiency gain over the month typically required to build traditional cableways for such projects. The drones operated along preset routes to deliver the materials to altitudes of up to 1,650 meters with high precision. This use of an aerial drone swarm highlights a significant labor-saving advancement in remote and difficult construction scenarios.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Tuli Tuipulotu is expected to take on a more significant role this season after the departure of veteran Joey Bosa. The third-year player, who led the team with 8.5 sacks last season despite starting only nine games, is stepping into a full-time starting position and growing as a vocal leader on the defense. Coaches and teammates, including fellow edge rusher Khalil Mack, have praised Tuipulotu's versatility and playmaking ability. While expectations are high, the team remains measured, aiming to let the young player develop naturally as he becomes a central piece of the defense.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has successfully dismantled a large criminal organization responsible for a massive extortion scheme in the State of Mexico. The operation, dubbed "Liberacion," involved nearly 3,000 security personnel conducting 52 raids, leading to the arrest of eight alleged gang leaders. The group, which had ties to a major drug cartel, controlled labor unions and extorted businesses and individuals across 14 municipalities in various industries. Authorities described it as the largest-ever operation against extortion gangs in the country, seizing stolen animals, materials, and vehicles in the process.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports, a decision the Trump administration has lauded as a "major trade breakthrough." The rules, originally implemented to prevent the spread of mad cow disease, will be eased after U.S. authorities strengthened controls for tracing cattle from Canada and Mexico. While U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins celebrated the end of "non-scientific trade barriers," some Australian lawmakers expressed suspicion about the timing, suggesting it was a move to appease President Trump. However, analysts believe Australian demand for U.S. beef will likely remain low due to pricing.</p>

          <p>While Europe is generally a popular destination for LGBTQIA+ travelers, the legal rights and social acceptance for the community vary significantly from country to country. A guide from the organization ILGA ranks Malta as the most progressive, while Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey are at the bottom. The article advises queer travelers to research national customs and laws in advance, noting that even in accepting countries, public displays of affection may be viewed differently. It also provides practical advice for transgender and non-binary individuals, who can face difficulties at border controls, and highlights cities like Berlin and Amsterdam known for their vibrant queer scenes.</p>
