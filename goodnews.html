          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has been controversially called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as a replacement for an injured player. His selection marks a significant return to the international stage after a nearly two-year absence from Test rugby. The decision is considered controversial because Farrell has not played competitively in nine weeks following a concussion. Critics point out that other in-form players who have been actively training with their national squads were overlooked in his favor.</p>

          <p>Fans of the singer Lorde are reporting that physical CD copies of her new album, 'Virgin,' are not working in their stereos. The album was released on a transparent disc to match its aesthetic theme, but this design appears to interfere with the lasers used by many CD players to read data. While some fans have found it works on devices like a PlayStation, many are frustrated that a product they purchased is unusable out of the box. The record label has reportedly offered returns to affected customers.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus who oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" are acting recklessly. The author contends that voting against the legislation is a vote to kill it entirely, which would result in a massive, economy-killing tax hike when current cuts expire in 2026. The column urges these members to support the bill, framing it as essential for delivering on key GOP promises regarding the economy, defense, and border security.</p>

          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors has identified a pattern in some people called being a glucose "dipper," where blood sugar crashes two to three hours after a meal. These dips are linked to increased fatigue, mood changes, and consuming hundreds of extra calories throughout the day, potentially hindering weight loss. To prevent these crashes, experts recommend strategies like never eating carbohydrates alone, instead pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber to stabilize blood sugar levels and maintain energy.</p>
