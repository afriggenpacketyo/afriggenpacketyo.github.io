          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, with a 0.2% decrease in the March quarter, primarily due to falling exports. Preliminary government data revealed that the gross domestic product was weaker than expected, with exports declining by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies have impacted Japan's export-heavy economy. However, domestic demand showed a bright spot with 0.6% growth. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rate, with potential for a rate hike later in the year.

          <p>Migrating humpback whales are posing a threat to Northern California's commercial crab season, as the whales are becoming entangled in the ropes used to pull up crab cages. Since 2007, hundreds of humpback whales have been injured or killed by these entanglements. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech pop-up system to retrieve his catch with minimal rope, allowing him to fish when others cannot. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect the whales.

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossil analysis indicates that Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, had mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges happening in both directions. The article highlights the findings of a scientific study on the migration patterns of ancient horses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved an agreement for the United Arab Emirates to build the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the United States. This decision reverses a previous policy under the Biden administration, which had concerns about China potentially accessing the technology.

While some support the deal for its economic benefits, others worry about the potential risks to U.S. dominance in AI and the security of the technology.
