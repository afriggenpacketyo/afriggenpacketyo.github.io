          <p>SoftBank shares surged by 13% after the Japanese conglomerate announced its agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a deal subject to global regulatory approval. This strategic move significantly advances SoftBank's footprint in Artificial Intelligence, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will propel humanity forward. The acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This article also notes SoftBank-owned British chip designer Graphcore's planned $1.3 billion investment in India, including a new research hub, underscoring SoftBank's expansive global AI strategy.

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point Gaza peace plan, now in its "first phase" of agreement, outlines a comprehensive roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, Israel's phased withdrawal to an "agreed upon line," and Hamas's release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. It also proposes Gaza's demilitarization under international monitors, with governance by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee," not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. This article details provisions for full aid, economic redevelopment, and a temporary International Stabilization Force, alongside a commitment to an "interfaith dialogue process" and a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, appeared largely unconvinced by arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulation that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day. Representative Michael Bost, a Republican who won his election, sued, claiming harm due to a lowered margin of victory and increased staff costs during the extended count. Justices like John Roberts and Elena Kagan questioned the standing for a winning candidate, while Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor criticized the lack of factual allegations in Bost's brief. This article highlights the justices' skepticism towards both sides, particularly regarding the definition of harm and who should automatically be able to sue over election rules, noting the potential for a "disaster" if any candidate could challenge rules.</p>
