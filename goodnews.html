          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing various diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes that gene technology will enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has expressed support for such bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue that the bill does little to curb mass shootings and only punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates describe the proposed ban as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>
