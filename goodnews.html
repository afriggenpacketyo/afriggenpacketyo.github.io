          <h2>Several US States Reconsider Fluoridation of Public Drinking Water</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decades-old public health practice is facing renewed debate as several states, including Arkansas, consider legislation to ban or remove fluoride from drinking water. Critics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raise concerns about potential health risks, citing a National Institutes of Health report that found a possible link between high fluoride levels and lower IQs in children. However, the American Dental Association and the CDC continue to endorse fluoridation as a safe and effective public health achievement for preventing tooth decay, highlighting a significant clash over scientific guidance.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through Death Valley. He finished the race, known as one of the world's toughest, in under the 48-hour official time limit, a goal he had failed to meet three years prior. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, endured temperatures around 118 degrees Fahrenheit with the help of his dedicated support crew. His achievement serves as an inspiring example of endurance and determination at any age.</p>

          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading private companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop its artificial intelligence and energy sectors. The initiative aims to leverage the state's natural gas and nuclear resources to power energy-intensive AI data centers, with the goal of creating tens of thousands of jobs. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event featured prominent leaders from technology and energy, including from Google, Amazon, and Westinghouse. The announcement was met with some local protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide clear rules and consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins and boosting their mainstream adoption for payments. Supported by the Trump administration as part of a push to make the U.S. a crypto leader, the bill seeks to harness the potential for faster, lower-cost transactions while addressing the risks associated with digital currencies.</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a solid alibi and evidence that made his involvement unlikely, such as wearing an arm cast. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney’s Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, leading to the settlement that addresses the profound injustice of his wrongful incarceration.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's heightened deportation efforts, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a bill aimed at comprehensive immigration reform. The legislation, co-sponsored by Republican Maria Elvira Salazar and Democrat Veronica Escobar, proposes a seven-year "Dignity Program." This program would offer legal status and work authorization to undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also includes provisions for enhanced border security and reforms to the asylum and visa systems.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The extensive makeover is necessary due to the hot, humid conditions inside the 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse, which have caused significant rusting to its iron structure. The project involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the renovation is to upgrade the heating system to air and water source heat pumps, making the landmark building net-zero in emissions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade deal with Indonesia, averting a planned 32% tariff on its goods in exchange for greater market access for American firms. Under the new agreement, the U.S. will impose a lower 19% tariff, while Indonesia will reportedly lower its own trade barriers for U.S. products. As part of the deal, Trump stated that Indonesia has also agreed to purchase billions of dollars worth of American energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest in a series of negotiations following a broad tariff threat issued by the White House.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's courts will retry Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim's family successfully argued for the retrial, claiming his 1979 military court conviction was unjust and involved torture. The case re-examines whether Kim was a traitor seeking power or a patriot who killed a dictator to prevent further bloodshed and restore democracy. This historic retrial forces a national reckoning with a pivotal moment in the country's turbulent path from dictatorship to democracy, a debate that remains deeply polarizing today.</p>

          <p>At an energy summit in Pittsburgh, Westinghouse interim CEO Dan Sumner announced a plan to build 10 new large-scale AP1000 nuclear reactors across the United States, with construction to begin by 2030. The announcement, made directly to President Trump, aligns with the administration's executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear power capacity by 2050. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the company projects the initiative will generate $75 billion in economic value. This ambitious plan follows the completion of two similar Westinghouse reactors in Georgia, a project that faced significant delays and cost overruns.</p>

          <p>The 'Star Wars' series 'Andor' earned 14 Emmy nominations, including for outstanding drama series, a result that showrunner Tony Gilroy called affirming. In an interview, Gilroy reflected on the show's grounded, political-thriller narrative and its "spooky" parallels to current global events, which he admitted were unexpected. He described creating the series as the "seminal creative experience" of his life, praising the sense of community among the cast and crew. The show was recognized across numerous categories, including writing, directing, and acting for Forest Whitaker's guest role.</p>
