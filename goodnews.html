          <p>To promote Michael Jackson's album HIStory, ten giant statues were erected around the world in 1995. After Jackson's death, the statues' locations became points of interest for fans. One statue stood at a McDonald's in the Netherlands for years before being removed due to controversy following the Leaving Neverland documentary. Another statue resides in the courtyard of a defunct Austrian nightclub, while another is located at a Swiss fairground, though it hasn't been displayed in years. A repainted statue can be seen in a now-abandoned theme park in South Africa, and another statue was restored in 2019 at an Italian amusement park and is currently for sale. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media is rife with advice on lowering cortisol levels, a hormone released in response to stress, but experts caution against relying on these quick fixes. Many suggested remedies, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, lack scientific evidence and may not address the underlying causes of stress. One individual, Jasleen Kaur Carroll, experienced burnout and lupus flare-ups despite trying various social media hacks, leading her to seek therapy and mindfulness practices. Experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress, such as relationship problems or financial worries, and consulting medical professionals for sudden body changes that could indicate underlying health issues.</p>

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla criticized Vice President JD Vance after Vance referred to him as "Jose" during a press conference in Los Angeles, calling it "petty and unserious." Padilla suggested the misnaming was intentional and reflected the administration's skewed priorities. Vance's office claimed it was a mistake and that he must have mixed up two people who have broken the law, a claim Padilla denies. Other California Democrats, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, rallied behind Padilla, highlighting the racial undertones in Vance's comments.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are proposing a ¬£10,000 bonus for new army recruits and a ¬£20,000 payment for former personnel who rejoin, aiming to boost troop numbers amidst global instability. The party claims this initiative would increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to over 73,000. Leader Sir Ed Davey emphasized the need for Britain to be "war-ready" in light of Vladimir Putin's actions and Donald Trump's unpredictability, advocating for a public awareness campaign to prepare households for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The proposal anticipates increased defense spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax.</p>

CRISPR Therapeutics, which recently secured approval for a CRISPR gene editing-based product, also holds promise for investors. The average price forecast for Viking Therapeutics suggests a substantial increase in its stock price, but the company's success is heavily reliant on the outcomes of its trials (not investment advice).</p>
