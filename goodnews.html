          <p>The Trump administration is offering migrants in the U.S. illegally free airline tickets and a $1,000 stipend to voluntarily self-deport. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will use the CBP Home app, previously used under the Biden administration for legal entry, to facilitate the process. Eligible immigrants will receive travel assistance and the stipend after their departure is confirmed, and those who sign up will be deprioritized for arrest by ICE, incentivizing them to leave the country. DHS officials argue that this initiative is a more dignified and cost-effective way to manage unauthorized immigration, saving the government money compared to the average $17,121 cost of arresting, detaining, and deporting a migrant.</p>

According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, self-deportation is the "best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest." The program requires immigrants to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Home" app and stipends will be paid after arrival in their country of origin is confirmed.

          <p>An increasing number of Americans are turning to online sources for parenting advice, seeking to optimize every aspect of child-rearing. However, Amanda Hess's book, *Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age*, suggests that online preparation cannot truly ready one for parenthood, as the experience is unique and unpredictable. Hess analyzes the online attention economy, highlighting how parenting experts sell the illusion of control through apps, gadgets, and courses. The book suggests that commodified advice has led parents to believe that more information is better than good information.</p>
