          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix rom-com, "Too Much," is set in London and draws inspiration from her own life, though she chose not to star in it, partly to avoid the intense body scrutiny she faced during her "Girls" era. In an interview, Dunham reflects on society's persistent fatphobia and misogyny, her personal growth since her 20s, and learning to take more time and space for herself after past controversies. The series, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, explores themes of love and vulnerability, which Dunham contrasts with the more sexually-focused narrative of "Girls."</p>

          <p>Following a public feud with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party." The article details the significant challenges Musk faces, including navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access and party recognition. Experts note that while Musk's wealth could fund the effort, building a national party is a multi-year, multi-million dollar project that would face intense legal opposition from the established Democratic and Republican parties.</p>

          <p>Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, are channeling billions into their philanthropy, the Ballmer Group, with a mission to improve economic mobility for children and families in disadvantaged communities. Initially skeptical of private philanthropy's impact compared to government, Steve was convinced by Connie to launch the organization, which now takes a "cradle-to-career" approach. This year alone, they have donated over half a billion dollars to causes including early childhood education, K-12 support, and housing initiatives. Their major contributions focus on communities they have personal ties to, such as Los Angeles and Washington state.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Ina Garten, known as the "Barefoot Contessa," has built a culinary empire based not on spontaneous flair but on meticulous precision and relentless recipe testing. Despite her calming on-screen presence, Garten admits to being a nervous cook who tests some recipes up to 25 times to ensure they are foolproof for home cooks. Her journey began after leaving a White House job to buy a small specialty food store, which she grew into a Hamptons institution. This experience taught her what people truly want to eat at home, forming the foundation for her bestselling cookbooks and long-running, Emmy-winning television show.</p>

          <p>A recent profile details Steve Ballmer's career, from his early days at Microsoft with Bill Gates to his current role as the enthusiastic owner of the LA Clippers. The article highlights his distinctive, high-energy leadership style, which became a trademark during his tenure as Microsoft's CEO, where he tripled the company's revenue despite famously underestimating the iPhone's potential. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Clippers for $2 billion and has since invested heavily in the team, including a new $2 billion arena, driven by a relentless passion for winning.

          <p>Wyoming's Green River Drift, the longest-running cattle drive in the United States, continues a 125-year-old tradition where ranchers push thousands of cattle 70 miles to summer pastures. This practice, born out of necessity after a harsh winter in the 1890s, allows ranchers to grow hay in the valley for the winter. Today, the remaining 11 ranching families face modern challenges, including predators like wolves and grizzly bears, and public debate over grazing on federal lands. Despite the hardships and slim profit margins, the ranchers are driven by a deep love for their heritage and the land, which they are working to preserve through conservation easements.</p>

          <p>Smith Island, a remote Maryland community in the Chesapeake Bay, is facing an existential threat from rising sea levels, erosion, and land subsidence, making its residents potential climate refugees. Despite the challenges and a state buyout offer in 2013, the island's roughly 200 residents, many descended from 17th-century settlers, have refused to leave, choosing instead to adapt. They have secured millions in grants for infrastructure projects like elevating roads and are diversifying their economy with tourism and local businesses. This resilience has even attracted new residents, who are drawn to the island's unique culture and tight-knit community despite the grim environmental projections.</p>

          <p>In 2007, Donald Trump launched a line of premium steaks, burgers, and hot dogs under the brand Trump Steaks, marketed as "The World's Greatest Steaks." Despite being USDA Prime grade beef from a reputable supplier, the venture failed after just two months. The product was sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and QVC, limiting accessibility and failing to attract customers willing to pay high prices for frozen meat. Ultimately, poor reviews citing bland taste and grainy texture, combined with the high cost, led to minimal sales and the brand's swift disappearance from the market.</p>

He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody civil war, and understanding its divisions and complexities makes the emergence of its ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that a citizen's obligation is to engage in lifelong learning and that history should be told with all its complicated and uncomfortable truths, including the founders' ownership of enslaved people, to create a fuller, richer narrative accessible to everyone.</p>
