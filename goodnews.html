          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May indicates that the annual inflation rate rose to 2.4%, slightly higher than April's 2.3%. This increase reflects a cooler-than-expected rise last month, suggesting that the impact of President Trump's tariffs has not yet fully affected consumer prices. The inflation rate was influenced by a decline in gasoline prices, while other items like clothing and airline fares also saw price decreases. Economists anticipate that the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting rates until later in the year, while closely monitoring when Mr. Trump's tariffs will show up in the inflation data (not investment advice).</p>

She argues that the media often overlooks the resilience and camaraderie within immigrant communities, instead sensationalizing stories of chaos and unrest. She highlights the importance of acknowledging the humanity and sacrifices of immigrants, who are often reduced to political talking points or data figures.</p>

          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold became the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing demand. The precious metal's stockpiles are nearing levels seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. Central banks accumulate liquid assets like foreign currencies and gold as a hedge against inflation and to diversify holdings. China has been a major driver of the gold rally, but there are indications that central bank purchases may slow down in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>

Apple is challenging the Home Office's request for the right to access global customers' data in the interest of national security, arguing it compromises user privacy.

The eighth hole has been a topic of discussion, with some players calling it "ridiculous" and "silly." The USGA aims to challenge players by requiring them to use every club in their bag. The hole has been a talking point for decades, with its length exceeding the average drive of a PGA Tour player in past years. The psychology of par and the challenge of using a wood on a par three add to the hole's intrigue.</p>
