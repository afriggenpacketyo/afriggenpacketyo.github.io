          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has expressed hope that a government shutdown can be avoided ahead of the Tuesday deadline, with a key meeting scheduled between congressional leaders and President Trump. A major point of contention is the Democratic push to extend the Affordable Care Act's tax credits, which they argue are critical for American families facing rising costs. While Republicans like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise advocate for a short-term funding bill to allow for further negotiations, both sides are publicly stating their desire to find a bipartisan agreement. The outcome of Monday's White House meeting is seen as crucial for resolving the impasse.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Lopez reflects on her leading role in the new movie musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman," calling it a part she has been waiting for her entire life. She discusses the personal challenges she faced during filming, as it coincided with her divorce from Ben Affleck, who served as one of the film's executive producers. Lopez explains that channeling her energy into the role was a positive outlet during a difficult time and ultimately contributed to her personal growth. The film, a story of two prisoners finding escape through imagination, is described by Lopez as a love letter to the Latin and queer communities.</p>

          <p>China is developing a new industrial strategy, known as a "pull" system, to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This approach aims to transform the aerospace production process by having final assembly stages pull components from suppliers on an as-needed basis, rather than relying on traditional forecasting. The goal is to lower costs, reduce delays, and increase flexibility in space system production. This industrial revolution is seen as a critical step for China to dominate the exponentially growing global space economy.</p>

While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, creating a market recalibration that benefits independent retailers and service-based businesses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi, certain limiting beliefs prevent many people from increasing their income. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to manage money and earn more, which creates shame and prevents them from seeking help. Another is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and consistent effort. Finally, the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start "later" is a major obstacle, as the perfect time never arrives. Overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking meaningful action to improve one's financial situation.</p>
