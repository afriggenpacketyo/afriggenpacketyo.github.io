        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Euro 2025 hosts Switzerland began their home tournament with a 2-1 defeat to Norway in Basel, despite taking an early lead. An unfortunate own goal by defender Julia Stierli decided the match after Norway's Ada Hegerberg had cancelled out the Swiss opener. Despite the loss, which made Switzerland the first Women's Euros host to lose their opening game, head coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic about their chances. She emphasized that the team still has a path to the quarter-finals and praised the players for embracing the pressure in front of a sold-out home crowd.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, was released from an ICE detention center in Texas after being held for nearly five months. Sakeik, who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her attorneys stated her release followed significant legal and public pressure, and came after ICE had attempted to deport her despite her pending green card application and marriage to a U.S. citizen. Her legal team condemned the detention and deportation attempts as unconstitutional and a reflection of harsh immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from the Southeast Asian nation. In return, the agreement grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnamese markets. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the re-routing of Chinese products. This agreement comes as many other countries are still negotiating with the U.S. to avoid steep "reciprocal" tariffs set to take effect soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer identified two major trends currently influencing the stock market: developments in global trade with Vietnam and the weakening U.S. dollar. He noted that President Trump's new trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered a threatened tariff, caused a jump in the stocks of companies like Nike and Williams-Sonoma that manufacture there. Additionally, Cramer pointed out that the U.S. dollar has reached a four-year low. He suggested this weakness is beneficial for consumer packaged goods companies, as it makes their exported products more competitive globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of monitoring software provider Datadog surged by 10% in extended trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. S&P Global stated that Datadog will replace Juniper Networks, which was recently acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, effective before the start of trading on July 9. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index-tracking funds are required to purchase the company's shares to rebalance their portfolios. This continues the trend of tech companies gaining prominence in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adapted essay reflects on the brief but impactful career of Ritchie Valens, a Chicano rock 'n' roll pioneer who died in a 1959 plane crash at age 17. The article highlights his innovative musical style, which blended traditional Mexican sounds with American rock, most famously in his hit "La Bamba." It also delves into the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," detailing how director Taylor Hackford and the band Los Lobos rerecorded Valens's music to make it resonate with a new generation. The piece argues that Valens's work set a precedent for the global crossover success of Latin music today.</p>

          <p>Center Deandre Ayton has agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers after securing a contract buyout from the Portland Trail Blazers. Ayton, the former No. 1 overall draft pick, will fill a significant need for the Lakers at the center position, which was a weakness last season. He provides size, athleticism, and a lob threat to pair with the team's star playmakers. Ayton averaged 14.4 points and 10.2 rebounds for the Trail Blazers last season, though his playing time was limited by a calf injury.</p>
