          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to increase in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but also cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%, while economists predict a rate reduction in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been found not guilty of second-degree murder in the retrial concerning the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022. The jury acquitted her of the most serious charges, including manslaughter and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death, but found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argued O'Keefe was attacked and beaten by others. The verdict sparked contrasting reactions, with Read thanking her supporters and witnesses against her calling it a miscarriage of justice.</p>

These films, including ‚ÄúStar Wars,‚Äù ‚ÄúE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,‚Äù and ‚ÄúJurassic Park,‚Äù have collectively earned over $15 billion during the summer months. The list includes a range of genres, from science fiction and action to animation and comedy, reflecting the diverse tastes of moviegoers over the decades. Notably, the tracking of box office numbers before 1981 was not as robust as it is today, and the summer of 2020 saw a virtual shutdown of movie theaters due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, a drug that clinical trials suggest provides near-complete protection against HIV infection with just two injections a year. This treatment offers a more convenient alternative to the current daily pill regimen and could reach more people, especially those facing stigma. While the drug's efficacy is high, its cost of approximately $28,000 a year could limit access, particularly in countries with the highest HIV burden, and the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid could further restrict its reach.</p>

Despite the drug's potential impact, its launch faces challenges, including the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts, but Gilead has committed to providing lower-cost versions in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that if the U.S. were to use a "bunker buster" bomb on a suspected underground nuclear weapons site in Iran, the risk of widespread contamination would be minimal. The site in question, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, primarily processes uranium isotopes in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas, which is heavy and unlikely to travel far. While a strike could release hydrofluoric acid, the underground caverns and the collapsing mountain above would likely inhibit any significant environmental release, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iran's facilities.</p>

          <p>Shares of Coinbase and Circle surged after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing a federal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant legislative win for the crypto industry. The bill, which now heads to the House, aims to provide regulatory clarity and foster investment in the stablecoin sector, and Coinbase, which co-founded USDC and shares revenue with Circle, and Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, saw significant gains in their stock prices. If the GENIUS Act becomes law, it could pave the way for explosive growth in the nearly $260 billion stablecoin market, driving more revenue to key infrastructure players like Circle and Coinbase.
