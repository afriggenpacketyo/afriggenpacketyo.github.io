          <p>The Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the city of Chicago following comments made by Mayor Brandon Johnson regarding the diversity of his administration. Johnson touted the high percentage of Black officials in his administration, leading to concerns about potential discriminatory hiring practices. The DOJ's probe is based on suggestions that hiring decisions were made solely on the basis of race, violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This investigation comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. </p>

          <p>This article discusses counterintuitive debt relief features. Being behind on payments could help qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, as it demonstrates an inability to pay. Smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000 or more, may also qualify for debt relief services. Taking out another loan, such as a debt consolidation loan, could be advantageous by consolidating debt at a lower interest rate, streamlining the payoff strategy. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>This article explores the impact of debt forgiveness on your credit score. Settling a debt for less than what is owed can negatively affect your credit, as it is typically marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full." While debt forgiveness can lower your credit score, the damage is not permanent and lessens over time with responsible financial behavior. Whether debt forgiveness is worth the credit damage depends on individual circumstances, with considerations for those facing bankruptcy or wage garnishment. (not investment advice) </p>
