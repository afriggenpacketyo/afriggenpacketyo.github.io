          <p>Experts predict that gold prices, which have risen to over $3,300 per ounce, will likely maintain their value in the second half of 2025, with potential for further increases if new economic risks emerge. Key drivers include sustained consumer demand from both new and existing investors, persistent geopolitical instability that enhances gold's safe-haven appeal, and its role as a hedge against stubborn inflation. While some investors are selling to realize gains, an influx of first-time buyers seeking portfolio protection is helping to support the elevated prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 09:57:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience outlines four major but often overlooked obstacles to intimacy in relationships. These include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to past partners, a persistent negativity bias that fosters self-doubt, and the physiological effects of stress. The article emphasizes that intimacy is more than just physical and is crucial for a thriving relationship. It suggests practical steps such as setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and openly communicating about stress responses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication coach, responding to someone's struggle with "I've been there" can be counterproductive, as it shifts the focus away from the person sharing. To show genuine empathy, one should instead focus on being fully present, which includes using open body language and eliminating distractions. The article suggests helpful techniques like repeating a key word the speaker used, embracing silence to allow for reflection, and using the phrase "Tell me more" to encourage deeper sharing. These methods help the speaker feel truly heard and understood.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged past $120,000 to a new record high, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. This "Crypto Week" in Congress is expected to provide a clearer regulatory framework, potentially boosting institutional investment and confidence in digital assets. Analysts suggest that strong demand from institutional buyers is a primary factor in the rally, which could continue despite potential market risks from international trade disputes.

          <p>The British government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting that its ownership could be transferred to its postmasters. This proposal for mutualization, which has been discussed for over a decade, aims to transform the organization's culture and restore trust following the Horizon IT scandal. The consultation will also explore future services, particularly banking, and other governance models like a charter system similar to the BBC. The government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches.</p>
