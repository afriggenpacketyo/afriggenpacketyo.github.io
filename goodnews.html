          <p>A proposed $177 million settlement has been reached concerning two major data breaches that exposed the personal information of millions of AT&T customers. Affected individuals can now file claims for compensation, potentially receiving up to $7,500 depending on the extent of their losses and which breach impacted them. The settlement, which consolidates multiple class-action lawsuits, awaits final court approval in December 2025. Customers must submit their claims by November 18, 2025, to be eligible for payment.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., a task force established by President Trump has significantly streamlined the city's gun permitting and registration processes. The wait time for concealed carry permits has been reduced from several months to an average of five days by improving administrative efficiency without altering local gun laws. This initiative, led by the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," also allows for next-day and walk-in appointments for firearm registration, aiming to help law-abiding residents more easily obtain the means to protect themselves.</p>

          <p>A research team at Tianjin University in China has developed a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. The team has established a pilot production line for the battery, which could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles and alleviate "range anxiety" for consumers. If successfully scaled, this technological breakthrough could also dramatically increase the endurance of drones and other electric devices. The new battery has also demonstrated strong resilience and stability in safety tests.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered 31 shipwrecks at the bottom of Germany's Lake Constance, including the suspected hulls of two large paddle steamers, one of which is believed to have been sunk during a World War II air raid. The "Wrecks and Deep Sea" project utilized remote-operated vehicles to survey the lake bed, also uncovering a remarkably well-preserved cargo sailing ship. These findings offer valuable insights into historical shipbuilding and maritime technology. Officials plan to document the wrecks for their historical value rather than attempting costly salvage operations.</p>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-olds in the UK have been accepted into their first-choice university this year, with over 226,000 securing their "firm" offer. This trend is attributed to several factors, including strong A-level results and a larger demographic cohort. However, it is also driven by financial pressures on universities, which are facing a decline in international student enrollment and are therefore more inclined to accept domestic students to ensure financial stability. This has led to a competitive Clearing process, with many institutions offering incentives to fill remaining spots.</p>

Liverpool is reportedly seeking £25 million for the player, who has struggled for first-team opportunities since joining from Celtic in 2022. Doak, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is expected to be a key target for Bournemouth as they look to strengthen their squad. The negotiations are part of a busy transfer window for the Cherries, who are aiming to finalize significant team changes before the deadline.</p>

          <p>With ongoing market volatility, high-yield savings accounts offer a compelling option for savers looking to earn competitive interest without the risks of stocks or the restrictions of CDs. A deposit of $100,000 in an account with a 4.35% APY could potentially earn over $4,300 in interest over one year. While these accounts have variable rates that may decrease with anticipated Federal Reserve cuts, they are expected to remain a strong savings vehicle. The article suggests that savers can still secure substantial returns by acting while rates are elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have seen a significant decline from their recent peaks, creating a favorable environment for homeowners to consider refinancing. The average 30-year fixed rate has dropped substantially, prompting an increase in refinance applications. Experts suggest that homeowners with mortgage rates of 6% or higher, particularly those who purchased in recent years, could benefit from exploring refinancing options to lower their monthly payments. However, it's important to consider closing costs and the length of time one plans to stay in the home to ensure the savings are worthwhile. (not investment advice)</p>

While states with lower initial home values saw the largest percentage gains, homeowners across the country have experienced a significant boost to their net worth.

          <p>In India's agricultural regions like Bihar, farmers are increasingly turning to solar-powered cold storage units to combat significant food waste caused by inadequate infrastructure and extreme heat. These off-grid facilities allow farmers to preserve perishable produce like potatoes, fruits, and vegetables for longer, enabling them to wait for better market prices and avoid spoilage. While the upfront cost can be a barrier for small-scale farmers, government subsidies and community-based models are being promoted to make the technology more accessible. This innovation holds the promise of increasing farmer incomes and improving food security.</p>
