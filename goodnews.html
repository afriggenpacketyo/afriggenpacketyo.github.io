          <p>Canada Goose shares experienced a significant increase after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' predictions, although the company has withdrawn its fiscal 2026 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties. The luxury retailer is refraining from providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2026, citing dynamic consumer spending patterns influenced by the unpredictable global trade environment. Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose remains confident in its brand strength, solid financial position, and adaptability to changing conditions. The article notes that the majority of Canada Goose's production is compliant with trade agreements, minimizing the impact of potential tariffs.</p>

          <p>Kohl's CEO Ashley Buchanan was terminated after an investigation uncovered his affair with former Walmart executive Chandra Holt. Buchanan allegedly brokered a deal for Kohl's to sell Holt's coffee startup, Incredibrew, without disclosing their relationship. The terms of the deal were deemed unusual and favorable to Incredibrew, violating Kohl's ethics code. The relationship, an open secret for years, led to both Buchanan and Holt filing for divorce from their respective spouses in 2020.</p>
