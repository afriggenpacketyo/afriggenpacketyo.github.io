          <h2>Japan to Release Additional Rice Stockpiles to Curb Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 22:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb rising rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the move, which will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, and the government hopes the cheaper rice sold through direct contracts will lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese trade officials continued discussions in London on Tuesday, aiming to resolve trade differences following a call between the leaders of both countries. President Trump's top trade officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, met with their Chinese counterparts, with the U.S. seeking confirmation that China will restore the flows of critical minerals. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a quick resolution, anticipating the easing of U.S. export controls and the release of rare earths in volume after a "big, strong handshake."</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, a decision hailed as a landmark that will kickstart economic growth and usher in a golden age of clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, playing a crucial role in the government's plan to eliminate fossil fuels from the energy grid by 2030. However, the project faces opposition, with concerns raised about its cost and potential impact on consumer bills, while critics argue the money could be better spent on other priorities.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, announced plans to split into two separate companies by the middle of next year.

          <p>The Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amidst protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel. They will not engage crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, though they will carry ammunition for self-defense. The troops will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray, and these rules would only change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, with the focus on de-escalating situations.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks and free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking and that teachers must check its results. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to write routine letters to parents, but transparency and verification of AI-generated content are essential to mitigate risks such as data breaches and errors.</p>
