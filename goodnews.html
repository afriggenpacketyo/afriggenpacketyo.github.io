          <p>India and China held separate meetings with Global South nations during the UN General Assembly, revealing a quiet rivalry for influence over the developing world. While a united front was expected amid global trade uncertainties, their parallel diplomatic efforts show persistent competition. Chinese Premier Li Qiang focused on global development and cooperation, while India emphasized south-south trade and positioned itself as a democratic alternative to China. This divergence highlights their different strategies for gaining leadership within this crucial bloc of countries.</p>

The vehicle features a distinct living room with a large L-shaped couch, a double bed that lowers from the ceiling, and a built-in washer and dryer. It also includes a full kitchen with Corian countertops and a spacious bathroom with a standing shower. With a powerful off-grid energy system, the "glamper" is designed for comfortable, long-term travel, though its starting price is approximately $295,000.</p>

Following a heavy defeat four years ago, the European team has invested millions in preparation, using data analytics, sports science, and even virtual reality to prepare players for the hostile environment. The strategy, heavily influenced by data guru Edoardo Molinari, emphasizes retaining experienced players and maintaining consistent leadership with captain Luke Donald.

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man, has been awarded a $25 million settlement after being wrongfully imprisoned for 38 years for a 1983 murder and sexual assault. His conviction was overturned in 2022 after new DNA testing proved his innocence and identified the real perpetrator, who died in prison in 2020. The settlement is believed to be the largest wrongful conviction payout in California's history. Hastings' lawsuit accused Inglewood police and a district attorney's investigator of framing him, and his lawyers hope the case serves as a warning against such misconduct.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. experienced a significant and unexpected increase of 20.5% in August, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This surge occurred even before mortgage rates began to fall in September, surprising many economists. While some analysts suggest the data may be revised, others attribute the strong sales to elevated incentives offered by homebuilders. The strong demand reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a nine-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family of three has become the first to arrive in the UK as part of the "one in, one out" migrant treaty with France. The agreement, announced in July by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, involves the UK accepting a refugee with a valid protection case for every migrant returned to France who crossed the Channel illegally. This arrival follows the removal of four migrants from the UK to France under the pilot scheme. The government states the policy is a clear message to people-smuggling gangs that illegal entry will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Multiple rare "pink meanie" jellyfish, a species that can have tentacles up to 70 feet long, have washed up on the Texas coast. These massive jellyfish, which can weigh over 50 pounds, get their name from their bright pink color, though they tend to lose it on shore. The species, formally identified in 2011, primarily feeds on smaller moon jellyfish and follows their blooms in warm waters. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild, surprising beachgoers with their unusual appearance.</p>

Cramer also commented on the broader market, noting that rising bond yields are creating headwinds for interest-rate-sensitive stocks like Home Depot.

The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers. The move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oregon police have recovered the partial remains of an unidentified woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," nearly 80 years after her dismembered body was found in the Willamette River in 1946. Critical evidence, including the remains, had gone missing from police custody in the 1950s, halting the investigation. Recently, investigators learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery and successfully exhumed them. Authorities are now hopeful that modern forensic testing can finally identify the victim in the state's oldest unidentified-person case.</p>

The fire grew to over 100 acres, sparking fear among residents still mindful of the catastrophic Lahaina fire in 2023. However, firefighters were able to stop the blaze's forward progress, and evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the threat receded. Unlike the 2023 disaster, which was exacerbated by high winds, conditions were less severe, though the area is similarly surrounded by dry brush.</p>
