          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at an expo in Beijing, predicted that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace most human labor in factories within the next ten years. He described AI as a fundamental infrastructure, similar to electricity or the internet, that is set to revolutionize global supply chains by optimizing how goods are designed, built, and moved. Huang also noted that the U.S. government has indicated it will grant licenses for Nvidia to export its less powerful H20 chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late Representative Raul Grijalva, has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District. Backed by prominent establishment and progressive figures, she defeated several other candidates in the heavily Democratic district. The race was seen as a significant contest, reflecting the ongoing dynamics within the Democratic Party between its different ideological and generational wings. Grijalva is now the strong favorite to win the special election in September and serve the remainder of her father's term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation for college athletes. This move follows the recent advancement of a House bill, the "SCORE Act," aimed at superseding the various state laws that currently regulate how student-athletes can earn money. The NIL rule changes, enacted by the NCAA in 2021 after legal and political pressure, have already dramatically reshaped college sports by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other deals, creating a multi-million dollar industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports into the U.S. while granting American goods tariff-free access. According to Trump, the deal also involves significant Indonesian purchases of U.S. energy, agricultural products, and Boeing aircraft. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet confirmed these terms, leaving the final details of the agreement unclear. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent trade deal touted with Vietnam, where official confirmation was also delayed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills initially failed a procedural vote in the House, President Trump held a meeting with Republican holdouts who then agreed to support the legislation. The bills, including the GENIUS Act which focuses on stablecoins, are part of a "Crypto Week" push by the administration to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets. The initial failure was a rare instance of House Republicans voting against a Trump-backed initiative, but their quick reversal highlights the president's significant influence over the party conference.

          <p>As Congress considers the GENIUS Act, the debate over regulating stablecoins—a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar—is intensifying. Supporters argue that stablecoins offer a less volatile digital currency, enabling faster and cheaper financial transactions outside of traditional banking hours. The proposed legislation would create federal rules and consumer protections for the market, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. However, risks remain, such as the potential for a stablecoin to lose its peg to the underlying asset. (not investment advice)</p>

The bright gold uniform, a first for the team in a game, has drawn mixed online reactions, with comparisons ranging from the Minions to a mustard bottle. The navy uniform serves as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team also announced it will now have the option to wear its popular powder blue pants with its primary home and away jerseys.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks are bypassing international markets and buying gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines to acquire gold using local currency, preserving their foreign exchange reserves. This method is often cheaper than buying on the global market and supports the local mining industry. The trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire among central banks to hedge against geopolitical risks and strengthen their financial buffers. (not investment advice)</p>

The renovation will also aim to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with heat pumps.
