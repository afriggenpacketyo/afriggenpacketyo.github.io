          <p>President Trump has once again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after a better-than-expected April jobs report. Trump expressed his desire for lower rates to stimulate economic growth and lower consumer prices, asserting that there is no inflation to warrant keeping rates high. Despite his past criticisms of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump has recently softened his stance, although he maintains that he knows more about interest rates than Powell. The jobs report indicated a seasonally adjusted increase of 177,000 nonfarm payrolls in April, surpassing estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, exceeding expectations despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Job growth was led by health care, transportation, and warehousing sectors. While the report is positive, some economists caution that the effects of the tariffs may not be fully reflected in the data yet. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% for the month, slightly below forecasts, and the annual rate was 3.8%, the lowest since July 2024.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Harvard University professors are pledging to take temporary pay cuts to support the school's legal battle against the Trump administration's decision to freeze billions in federal funding and rescind the university's tax-exempt status. Eighty-four senior faculty members have committed to donating 10% of their salary this year, estimated at $2.5 million. Harvard filed a lawsuit after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding, citing alleged antisemitic incidents on campus and demanding changes to leadership and diversity policies. Harvard president Alan Garber said the funding cuts would have "stark real-life consequences."</p>
