        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DW article explores the complex relationship between the birth control pill and women's sex drive, highlighting diverse experiences where some women report a significant drop in libido. Studies indicate that around 15% of participants experienced decreased desire, possibly due to the pill's effect on testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds to free testosterone. While the pill offers sexual autonomy and can even boost libido for some by alleviating pregnancy worries, the article emphasizes the need for better information from doctors and less stigma around women's health. Ultimately, libido is a multifaceted phenomenon, influenced by hormonal, psychological, relational, and social factors, making a universal conclusion challenging.</p>

          <h2>Gatwick Airport Second Runway Expansion Receives Government Approval</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:06:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move aimed at boosting economic growth and "getting Britain building again." The project involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, potentially increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s, and passenger numbers to 80 million. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves lauded the creation of "thousands of jobs and billions in investment," the plan faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners like the Green Party, who deem it a "disaster for the climate crisis," raising concerns about air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate impacts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe suggests the global calendar for Olympic sports may need "re-engineering" due to the escalating challenges posed by climate change, following athletes' struggles with searing temperatures and stifling humidity in Tokyo. Research indicates 70% of athletes report climate impact on their training and competition programs, prompting serious consideration for holding endurance events separately or at different times of the year to protect athlete safety and performance. Despite these environmental concerns, Coe asserts the sport is in "good shape" with strong athlete performances and broader appeal, planning an inaugural Ultimate Championships in Budapest in 2026. This new event aims to test innovative ideas and ensure the sport remains engaging and athlete-focused, with ongoing discussions about increasing prize money.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Rep. Adam Smith, held a rare meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, pushing for increased military-to-military dialogue. This visit, the first by a House delegation since 2019, aims to further ties despite strained relations over trade, the status of Taiwan, and China's support for Russia. Smith emphasized the critical need for communication between the two most powerful militaries, stating, "it's really important that we get along, and we find a way to peacefully coexist in the world." The delegation's visit precedes an anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a regional summit, signaling ongoing efforts to manage complex US-China dynamics.</p>

          <p>Europe's initial public offering (IPO) market is experiencing a hopeful uptick, signaling a potential rebound after a prolonged period of sluggishness compared to Asian and U.S. markets. Recent successful listings, such as auto-parts supplier Aumovio and Swiss Marketplace Group, along with imminent debuts like Verisure and NOBA, indicate renewed investor appetite. Experts like Phil Drake from Bank of America note a significant increase in IPO activity, driven by factors including low volatility and enhanced dollar-based returns on European equity investments, which are attracting fresh U.S. capital. This positive trend suggests improving investor perspectives on public listings, particularly for high-quality, scalable companies with attractive growth opportunities across various sectors, pointing towards a more active equity capital market.

          <p>Shares of Apple supplier Luxshare jumped nearly 10% following reports that the Chinese device assembler has secured a deal with OpenAI to produce a consumer AI device. The Information reported that Luxshare is already developing a prototype resembling a smart speaker without a display, potentially competing with Apple's Siri-enabled devices. OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, has been actively expanding into dedicated AI hardware, poaching staff from Apple and partnering with former Apple designer Jony Ive. This collaboration could bring Apple's longtime supplier into OpenAI's orbit, signaling a significant move in the competitive AI hardware market for a late 2026 or early 2027 launch.

          <p>Chinese geologists are deploying the world's largest antenna and related electromagnetic technology to detect critical ore and energy resources buried kilometers deep, significantly advancing their position in the global race for critical minerals. This world-leading electromagnetic arsenal, systematically revealed for the first time in a China Geological Survey study, demonstrates China's unparalleled capability in deep-earth exploration. The sophisticated technology allows for unprecedented detection of vital resources like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths, which are essential for green technologies and global economic power. This development underscores China's strategic investment in geological science and its implications for global resource control and technological supremacy, potentially leaving other nations scrambling.</p>

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes found his rhythm in the second half, connecting with Tyquan Thornton for a 5-yard touchdown and setting up another score, despite earlier frustrations including Travis Kelce's on-field exchange with coach Andy Reid. The Chiefs' defense held Giants quarterback Russell Wilson to 160 passing yards, sacking him twice, and frustrating the veteran. Rookie Cam Skattebo was a bright spot for the Giants with 60 rushing yards and a touchdown, but Kansas City's strong second-half performance sealed their victory, moving them to a 1-2 record while the Giants fell to 0-3.</p>

          <p>An article explains China's "five-year plan" as a top-level roadmap guiding the nation's social and economic development over five-year periods. Adopted from the Soviet Union, these plans, implemented every five years since 1953 (with a brief hiatus from 1963-1965), set both quantitative development goals across different sectors and strategic priorities for important industries. They have been instrumental in China's remarkable transformation from extreme poverty to a technological powerhouse and the world's second-largest economy over more than seven decades. The continuous use of this planning model underscores its foundational importance to Beijing's long-term economic strategy and governance, shaping the country's trajectory.</p>

Fractional work, where professionals contribute part-time to multiple businesses, offered her greater autonomy and fulfillment, allowing her to escape burnout and choose clients.

The Fever, despite having six players on the injured list, maintained control after a strong third-quarter run, spoiling A'ja Wilson's celebration for becoming the WNBA's first four-time MVP.

The White House previously indicated Oracle would handle data and security, with Americans controlling six of seven board seats. This development follows Trump's "very productive call" with China's Xi Jinping and aims to resolve security concerns that have delayed a ban on the app, which Trump credits for helping him win an election.</p>

          <p>An article explores the growing recognition of music's profound therapeutic benefits in palliative and end-of-life care, highlighting how personalized playlists offer significant comfort to patients and their loved ones. Dave Gilmore, a terminally ill DJ, exemplifies this by curating a playlist of life-affirming songs, finding solace and deep connection through music. Experts explain that music "lights up" multiple parts of the brain, aiding memory recall and reducing anxiety and psychological pain, even for unconscious individuals, as hearing is often the last sense to go. Charities like Marie Curie emphasize music's role in creating shared experiences and a sense of normality, also providing lasting comfort to those grieving after a loved one's passing.</p>
