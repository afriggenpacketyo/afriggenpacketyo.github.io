          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£86 billion in the science and technology sector to fund research in areas like drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to decide how the funds are spent based on their area's expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the investment would create jobs and boost national security, with the package expected to be worth more than ¬£22.5 billion per year by 2029. While the funding was welcomed, research backers emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address financial challenges at universities to secure the UK's reputation for science.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing a wealth of unfinished sculptures and other artifacts. The site, known as Floga, has been under study since the mid-1980s, but the latest dig uncovered new architectural remains and various vessels. The artifacts included semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. Based on the findings, the site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, with the discovery of a room identified as an andron.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly interested in returning to the moon, driven by the prospect of using it as a base for scientific research and a gateway to Mars. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, aiming to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole and launch a new space station in lunar orbit. A joint China-Russia project also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could be used to support lunar bases and future Mars missions.</p>

          <p>The Labour government's upcoming Spending Review is seen as a critical opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. After a cautious first year, the government faces the challenge of convincing potential investors that its economic vision is real. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP for capital spending, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. The review aims to prioritize long-term challenges, such as industrial energy prices and social care costs, and "rewire the state" to boost growth.</p>

A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to work part-time after having her first child and believes that offering flexible options is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the profession. Data suggests that the number of new teachers entering the profession has decreased, while experienced staff members are leaving for better work-life balance or higher salaries. The government is trying to improve this by offering teachers a 4% pay rise and encouraging schools to offer flexible hours.</p>
