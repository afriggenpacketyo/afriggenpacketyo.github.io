While the deal aims to address U.S. national security concerns, China's trade negotiator stated that the interests of Chinese companies would not be compromised.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move he believes would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. The idea, which would require SEC approval, has been previously supported by business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. Proponents of the current system argue that quarterly reporting provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, and that less frequent updates could increase market volatility.

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a consistent downward trend for much of 2025, recently hitting a near one-year low, and may fall further this week. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. While this trend is favorable for potential homebuyers, the article cautions that securing the lowest rates still depends heavily on having a good credit score and shopping around among lenders.

This significant overstatement quickly went viral, leading to widespread mockery and jokes across social media platforms, with users pointing out the statistical impossibility of his claim.</p>

          <p>An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric indicates that renewable energy sources, specifically onshore wind and utility-scale solar, are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. While the initial capital investment for these projects is high, their operating and maintenance costs are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. This cost-effectiveness holds true even before factoring in government subsidies, though the report notes that recent legislation could alter the landscape for clean energy incentives.</p>
