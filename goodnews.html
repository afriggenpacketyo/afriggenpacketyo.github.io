        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiff's council has approved a new 10-year parking plan that will charge drivers of heavier vehicles, such as SUVs, more for residential parking permits. The plan, aimed at reducing congestion and air pollution, will also introduce surcharges for diesel cars and scrap resident permits in the city center. While the changes are intended to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport, they have drawn criticism from some residents, including tradespeople and students, who argue the new rules unfairly penalize those who rely on larger vehicles for their livelihoods or feel unsafe without nearby parking. The plan also creates new permit types for carers and NHS workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, has indicated the company's desire to expand its portfolio of live sports rights, but only if it can offer a "unique and special" broadcast experience. Speaking at an event, Cue criticized existing issues in sports broadcasting like regional blackouts and the need for multiple subscriptions, suggesting Apple aims to fix these problems. He highlighted Apple TV's global, blackout-free MLS package as a model for its approach, which prioritizes high-quality video and innovative features. While Apple currently airs MLB games, Cue implied the company is looking for comprehensive, international league deals rather than smaller packages.</p>

          <p>As Microsoft officially ends support for Windows 10, it is introducing a new experimental AI feature for Windows 11 to encourage users to upgrade. An updated Copilot assistant will be available to testers, enabling it to perform multi-step tasks on locally stored files, such as resizing photos or creating music playlists in apps like Spotify. This "Copilot Actions" feature, a type of computer-use agent, will operate in a contained environment for safety, allowing users to monitor its progress and intervene if necessary. The test is part of Microsoft's broader strategy to integrate more advanced AI capabilities directly into its operating system to enhance user productivity.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is necessary, as individual states have begun to implement their own safeguards. Speaking at a CNBC summit, the Tennessee Republican emphasized the need for a federal preemption standard to create uniform rules, particularly for protecting children and consumer data online. She referenced her work on the Kid's Online Safety Act and highlighted concerns that personal data is being used to train large language models without consent. Blackburn argued that regulation must focus on the end-use applications of AI and respond to growing public concern over the technology's potential harms.</p>

          <p>Electric air taxi manufacturer Beta Technologies has set the terms for its initial public offering, aiming to raise as much as $825 million and achieve a valuation of up to $7.2 billion. The company plans to sell 25 million shares at a price range of $27 to $33 each, joining other electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft makers like Joby and Archer in tapping public markets. Despite growing interest in the sector, boosted by new partnerships and government pilot programs, Beta Technologies has not yet turned a profit, reporting a net loss of $183 million for the first half of the year.

          <p>Despite the ongoing government shutdown that has halted pay for most federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that a way has been found to continue paying FBI agents. The announcement follows a similar move by the Trump administration to ensure members of the military would receive their paychecks using unspent funds from the previous fiscal year. While the source of the funds for the FBI was not specified, the move is intended to keep essential law enforcement personnel compensated. The FBI Agents Association expressed gratitude but noted that other crucial FBI staff, like analysts, are not covered and called on Congress to reopen the government.</p>

          <p>A couple who won a £6 million mansion in Blakeney through an Omaze prize draw will finally receive the keys after a prolonged planning dispute was settled. The issue arose when it was discovered that a swimming pool, tennis court, garage, and summer house on the property had been built without proper planning consent. North Norfolk District Council has now retrospectively approved the application from Omaze, ending the uncertainty. The company expressed its delight and confirmed it is arranging the property transfer to the winners, who had previously stated their intention to sell the house. The prize draw successfully raised over £4 million for the charity Comic Relief.</p>

          <p>Salesforce saw its stock rise by as much as 5% after the company provided a strong financial outlook, projecting revenue to exceed $60 billion by 2030. This forecast, which surpasses current analyst consensus, suggests a reacceleration of growth for the software giant, which has seen its growth rate dip in recent years. Executives expressed confidence in their AI-powered Agentforce software for automating customer service as a key driver of future revenue. The positive guidance aims to alleviate investor concerns about competition from new AI tools and Salesforce's ability to maintain its market leadership in the evolving tech landscape.

          <p>Despite an increase in flight delays due to air traffic controller shortages during the government shutdown, aviation experts maintain that air travel safety is not compromised. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are managing the situation by slowing down air traffic and implementing ground delays as precautionary measures to maintain safety standards. Experts note that while service quality and on-time performance are being affected, the core safety protocols remain intact. They also emphasize that airline pilots, who are not federal employees, have the final authority to determine if a flight is safe to operate, providing an additional layer of security.</p>

          <p>Paxos, the company that issues PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin, mistakenly minted $300 trillion worth of the tokens in what it described as a "technical error." The massive issuance, an amount more than double the world's estimated GDP, was spotted by market watchers on the Ethereum blockchain before Paxos quickly identified the mistake and "burned" the excess tokens. The company reassured the public that the error was internal, no security breach occurred, and customer funds remained safe. The incident highlights that the 1:1 dollar peg of stablecoins like PYUSD is guaranteed by the issuer's reserves and auditing, rather than being an intrinsic property of the minting process itself.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new State Superintendent of Education, Lindel Fields, is rescinding a controversial mandate from his predecessor that required public schools to place Bibles in every classroom and integrate them into lesson plans. The state's education department plans to file a motion to dismiss lawsuits that were brought against the previous superintendent, Ryan Walters, over the directive. The new leadership stated there are no plans to distribute Bibles or a related curriculum, believing such decisions are best left to individual school districts. This move marks a significant policy shift away from the previous administration's focus on incorporating religion into public education, which had drawn widespread criticism and legal challenges.</p>

To manage his hybrid work schedule, he typically uses a combination of bus, train, and plane, with each one-way trip taking four to six hours. Rodriguez began this routine after finding better job opportunities in Atlanta but choosing to maintain his residence in Philadelphia with his wife due to cost-of-living considerations. He views the commute not as a burden but as an opportunity to be productive and intentional, using the travel time for work, reading, or studying, and finds it less stressful than a daily drive in traffic.</p>

          <p>American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison has become the first person to successfully ski down the treacherous North Face of Mount Everest. After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, where he scattered the ashes of his late partner Hilaree Nelson, Morrison descended through the steep and dangerous "Supercouloir." The descent to the base of the face took just over four hours and was described as a mix of "survival skiing and actual shredding," including a 200-meter rappel down bare rock. This historic achievement, his third attempt on the route, was part of a sponsored expedition that included a support team of guides, Sherpas, and a camera crew.</p>
