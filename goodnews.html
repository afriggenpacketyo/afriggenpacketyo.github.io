          <p>A young kangaroo named Hickory escaped from its owner's enclosure in Saint Cloud, Florida, leading to the owner facing charges for lacking proper permits, according to this Fox News article. The kangaroo was seen hopping along a busy road before being captured by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission with the help of another licensed kangaroo facility owner. Hickory was tranquilized and taken to a wildlife preserve until the owner's enclosure meets local code requirements. The incident occurred shortly after a similar event in Alabama where a kangaroo caused an interstate shutdown.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 14:17:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is holding off on cutting interest rates due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth, according to the New York Times article. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank prefers to wait and assess the economic effects of the tariffs before making any adjustments to interest rates. Economists are increasingly predicting that the Fed will likely wait until September to consider cutting rates, with some suggesting a larger-than-usual half-point cut may be necessary at that point. The Fed's caution stems from inflation running above its 2 percent target and the need for concrete evidence of economic weakness before lowering rates.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries, according to this BBC article. The deal cuts tariffs on UK car exports to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles, scraps the 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into the US, and includes a $10 billion purchase of Boeing planes by the UK. However, pharmaceuticals remain a key area of ongoing negotiation, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. While President Trump declared the announcement would be a "major trade deal," it is not a free-trade agreement and requires further negotiations and legal paperwork.</p>

While specifics are still being finalized, the deal maintains a 10% blanket U.S. tariff on U.K. imports and requires the U.S. to negotiate an alternative arrangement to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as an incredible platform for the future.</p>

Mahdawi, a green card holder who led protests against Israel's war in Gaza at Columbia University, was detained for 16 days before a judge ordered his release. The Trump administration argued that Mahdawi should be deported due to his activism, but the judge ruled that his arrest may have been intended to stifle his speech.

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which he called a "breakthrough" deal that would include increased market access for American exports, according to this CBS News article. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on imported goods from all U.S. trade partners, including Britain, but U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost trade between the two countries and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to meet with a Chinese trade delegation in Switzerland, and more trade deals are in the works. Experts believe that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will move slowly in their trade discussions.</p>
