          <p>Shares of AI data center firm CoreWeave increased over 5% after the company announced its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, is slated for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a previous successful debt offering and a major data center project announcement, contributing to the company's significant stock price growth since its Nasdaq debut. Despite investor concerns about debt, the CEO affirms the company is meeting strong client demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The England women's national soccer team, the Lionesses, will no longer take the knee as an anti-racism gesture before matches, with manager Sarina Wiegman stating its impact is "not good enough." The decision was prompted by racist abuse targeted at defender Jess Carter on social media during the Euro 2025 tournament. The players believe a different approach is needed to tackle racism and hope that standing instead will spark new conversations about the issue. The squad has pledged its full support for Carter and her decision to speak out publicly.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 14:32:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With college costs rising, many students rely on federal loans, which have specific annual and lifetime borrowing limits to encourage responsible debt management. These limits vary based on factors like dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. For instance, a dependent first-year undergrad can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate limit for all undergrad loans is $31,000. Since these amounts often don't cover the full cost of attendance, the article suggests exploring private student loans to fill the funding gap after exhausting federal options.

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by appealing to cost-conscious consumers with value-oriented deals. CEO Russell Weiner stated that industry headwinds are creating an opportunity for the company, which reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, beating estimates. The chain has seen growth across all income levels, including low-income diners, by offering promotions like its $9.99 "Best Deal Ever." This strategy contrasts with other fast-food trends, as Domino's aims to win customers who might otherwise opt to eat at home due to high inflation.</p>

          <p>An NPR story highlights an act of kindness from a nurse named Ray, who provided comfort to a man named Alek Hermon during his father's final days. After Hermon made the difficult decision to take his father off life support, he felt numb and alone leaving the operating room. Ray, who had been one of the nurses caring for his father, ran down the hall, removed his sterile gear, and held Hermon in a tearful embrace. Hermon recalls the moment as a profound act of compassion from a stranger who recognized his suffering and stepped up to help.</p>

          <p>Author Joseph Lee's new book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the rich indigenous history of Martha's Vineyard, known to his Aquinnah Wampanoag people as Noepe. The book moves beyond the island's image as an affluent tourist destination to explore what it means to belong to a sacred land that is also a luxury playground. Lee, a tribal member, discusses the challenges of preserving identity and land in a place where tourism both sustains and threatens the small native community. The interview also touches on language revitalization and the complexities of federal recognition.</p>

The author recounts receiving a new passport just 14 days after applying online, a stark contrast to the lengthy waits often associated with government services. The system, which launched after overcoming initial glitches, has been a spectacular success, processing millions of applications efficiently. The piece credits the public servants who developed the system and suggests it serves as a positive example of a government function that truly works for its citizens.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator has released a surprise new album, "Don’t Tap the Glass," his second full-length project in less than a year. The 10-track LP follows his October album "Chromakopia" and features a funky, club-oriented sound produced entirely by Tyler himself. In a social media post, he explained the album was inspired by people's fear of dancing in public due to being filmed. He recommended that the album is best experienced through movement, such as dancing, driving, or running.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help lower the risk of dementia, registered dietitians recommend regularly incorporating three specific food types into your diet: berries, seafood, and leafy greens. Berries are rich in flavonoids that protect brain signaling pathways, while seafood like salmon and sardines provides omega-3 fatty acids that may reduce amyloid protein clusters. Leafy greens such as kale and spinach have been linked to less plaque buildup in the brain. These foods are central to the MIND diet, which studies have shown can significantly cut dementia risk.</p>

          <p>The process for launching an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is designed with multiple layers of redundancy to prevent unauthorized or rogue actions. Contrary to popular depictions, there are no single big red buttons inside the underground control capsules. Instead, launching a missile requires a complex sequence involving two officers, or "missileers," in at least two separate bunkers. Each officer must turn a key simultaneously with their partner, and both capsules must act in unison after decrypting and verifying launch orders and codes.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs, known for treating diabetes and obesity, are being explored as a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and underdiagnosed hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS often experience insulin resistance, and studies suggest that losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve this, in turn helping to balance hormones. Some patients in small trials and anecdotal reports have seen significant improvements in PCOS symptoms, including weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. However, experts stress the need for larger trials and note that insurance coverage remains a major barrier.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block a new Mississippi law that bans diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at public schools and universities. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs, including the Mississippi Association of Educators, who argue the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The judge cited that the law was already having a chilling effect on constitutional speech, such as discussions of gender theory at Jackson State University. A hearing for a longer-term preliminary injunction is scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
