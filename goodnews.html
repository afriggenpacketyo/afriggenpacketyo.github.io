          <p>The Tall Ships Races have begun in Aberdeen, an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors and billed as Scotland's largest tourist event of the year. Dozens of vessels from around the globe are participating in the four-day festival, which includes musical performances by bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs. Despite the festive atmosphere, organizers are monitoring a yellow weather warning for heavy rain. The event aims to foster international friendship and provide sailing training for young people before the ships depart for Norway.</p>

          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed a law legalizing medically-assisted suicide for terminally-ill adults, marking a significant policy shift in Eastern Europe. The legislation, approved with a 50-34 vote, follows a referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. The law applies to mentally competent adults with unbearable suffering and no prospect of improvement, excluding those with only mental illnesses. While hailed as a compassionate step, implementation is pending as procedures are finalized, and opposition groups have pledged to challenge the measure.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being viewed as a significant moment for Muslim and South Asian American political representation. His campaign, which focused on issues like affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters, including working-class immigrant communities. Mamdani's rise has been met with both widespread support from Muslims nationwide and Islamophobic attacks from political opponents. His success challenges long-standing assumptions about who can represent a major American city, reflecting broader shifts within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>The UK government has officially confirmed its support for London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships at London Stadium. The government will provide significant funding, estimated at around £35 million, to secure the event, which last took place in London in 2017. This decision follows an open letter from over 100 British athletes urging for backing, amid concerns the bid was at risk. The support is seen as a major boost for UK Athletics, with hopes that hosting the event will inspire a new generation and provide economic benefits.</p>

          <p>British MMA world champion Dakota Ditcheva has voiced her frustration with the difficulty in finding challengers following her dominant 2024 PFL flyweight tournament victory. The 26-year-old, who won all four of her fights last year with decisive stoppages, has experienced an eight-month wait for her next bout. Her momentum has stalled due to a lack of available high-level opponents within the promotion. Ditcheva is now set to face American Sumiko Inaba in Cape Town, South Africa, in the PFL's first major event on the continent.</p>

          <p>Following a poor showing at the Club World Cup, LAFC aims to rebound and win back fan support in a crucial derby match against their rival, the LA Galaxy. Despite their recent struggles in international competition, LAFC has won its last three MLS games and sits fourth in the Western Conference, while the Galaxy are at the bottom of the table. Coaches from both teams have emphasized that in a classic rivalry like this, current form and statistics are irrelevant. The match is also marked by a planned protest from Galaxy supporter groups over the club's silence on recent ICE raids.</p>

          <p>Deborah Mason, a 65-year-old grandmother known as 'Gangsta Debbs', has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for masterminding a family-run drug trafficking operation worth up to £80 million. Mason recruited her four children and other relatives to transport large quantities of cocaine across southeast England, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat.

          <p>Ahead of their world heavyweight title rematch at Wembley Stadium, boxing experts are divided on the outcome between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois. Usyk, the reigning champion, is favored by many due to his incredible skill and past victory, though some question if age and recent tough fights have taken a toll. Others believe the re-energized Dubois, who has won three straight fights since their first encounter, has the power and confidence to cause an upset. The fight presents Dubois with a chance to become the first British undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a more affordable and simpler method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly effective but expensive treatment for blood cancers and other diseases. The new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce the specialized anticancer cells directly within the patient's body, eliminating complex and costly external manufacturing processes. The team from Union Hospital in Wuhan has already used this innovative in-vivo method to successfully treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This breakthrough could make the powerful immunotherapy, which currently costs over $100,000 per treatment, accessible to many more patients.</p>

          <p>Over 250 Venezuelan migrants, who were detained in a high-security prison in El Salvador as part of a controversial Trump administration immigration deal, have been released and flown back to Venezuela. Their release was part of a broader prisoner swap that also secured the freedom of ten Americans held by Venezuelan authorities. The migrants had been accused by the White House of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, a claim for which little evidence was provided. Families are now being reunited, though human rights groups have documented severe mistreatment and torture within the Salvadoran prison.</p>

          <p>China's top market regulator, the SAMR, has summoned major tech companies including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address an intense price war in the food delivery sector. The meeting aimed to enforce regulations, encourage rational competition, and ensure a healthy market for all stakeholders, including consumers, merchants, and delivery riders. The regulator emphasized that the platforms must comply with laws related to e-commerce and anti-unfair competition. This action reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to rein in the country's powerful technology sector and curb monopolistic or disruptive business practices.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive development, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective control. The pitcher has been working on a simplified, more athletic approach on the mound to overcome the physical and mental issues that have plagued his career. His successful return is a crucial step for the Dodgers, who are counting on him to bolster their starting rotation for the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The United States has enacted the GENIUS Act, a new law establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, which could pave the way for wider use of these dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in payments. The legislation, signed by President Trump, requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long sought legitimacy. Proponents believe the law will reinforce the U.S. dollar's global status, while critics argue it lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections. (not investment advice)</p>
