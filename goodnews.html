          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been ruled out of the final Test match against India due to a shoulder injury sustained in the previous game. Despite the setback, Stokes expressed confidence that the injury is minor and will not affect his availability for the upcoming Ashes series. Ollie Pope will take over as captain in his absence, while the team has also made three changes to its bowling lineup to bring in fresh players for the decisive match.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump claims that his father's Turnberry golf course in Scotland "deserves" to host The Open again, suggesting that politics has been the primary reason for its exclusion from the major championship's rota. While the R&A, the event's organizer, has cited logistical and infrastructure issues, Eric Trump insists the course is impeccable and ready to host immediately. He believes that by the time The Open might return to Turnberry, his father will no longer be in the White House, potentially removing the political element.</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake in Russia, tsunami warnings for Hawaii were downgraded to advisories as the initial waves proved smaller than feared. While some coastal flooding and strong currents were observed, widespread, catastrophic damage was avoided, allowing evacuated residents to return home. Japan and the U.S. West Coast also lowered their alert levels, though officials continued to urge caution near shorelines as the event de-escalated from a major crisis.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the progress in renewable energy technology, especially solar and wind, constitutes a stunning and largely overlooked revolution. It highlights the dramatic fall in costs and increase in efficiency, which have made renewables a cheaper and superior alternative to the wasteful and poisonous fossil fuel system. The author contends that the energy transition is not about austerity but about embracing a cleaner, more democratic, and ultimately unstoppable energy future.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's newest expansion team, San Diego FC, is achieving historic success in its debut season with an unusually high-risk, possession-based style of play. The team emphasizes building up from the back, with goalkeepers rarely playing long passes—a statistical anomaly in MLS and top European leagues. This brave tactical approach, executed by a very young and budget-conscious defensive line, has unexpectedly vaulted the team to the top of the Western Conference standings.</p>
