        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laurent Mekies is set to take over as the new team principal for Red Bull's Formula 1 team, following the dismissal of Christian Horner. Mekies, an experienced engineer, is expected to bring a different, less adversarial leadership style to a team that has faced competitive decline and internal turmoil. His immediate task is to stabilize the team and reverse its performance slide, which has seen them struggle against rivals like McLaren. The change in leadership offers a chance for a cultural reset at Red Bull, moving away from Horner's controversial tenure and aiming to rebuild the team's spirit and competitive edge.</p>

          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement, Lowering Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 01:18:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes lowering the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto imports to 15% from the previous 25%. Trump described the agreement as "massive," stating that Japan would also open its markets to more American goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products, and invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership amid domestic challenges. The announcement comes after a period of declining Japanese auto exports to the U.S. due to the higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also held steady at 0.6%. These soft inflation figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore with room to potentially ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has expressed concern about a "subdued" domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, anticipating that global consumption will soften and U.S. tariffs will negatively impact exports.

          <p>A chain of stores named Duck World, specializing in collectible rubber ducks, is successfully navigating London's challenging retail environment. With four locations in prime real estate, the business appeals to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers, particularly millennials, by offering a unique and nostalgic product. Despite pressures from inflation and rising business costs, the company's co-founder remains optimistic, citing the iconic status of the rubber duck. Retail analysts suggest the business benefits from the "treatonomics" trend, where consumers buy small, affordable luxuries, and high profit margins on its products, which are largely manufactured in China.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence that a formidable "terror bird," a top predator standing taller than a human, was killed by an even larger reptile 13 million years ago. An analysis of a fossilized leg bone found in Colombia revealed teeth marks that match those of an extinct, five-meter-long caiman species. Since the bite marks show no signs of healing, researchers believe the bird either died in the attack or was scavenged shortly after death. This rare finding provides a fascinating glimpse into the interactions between two apex predators and suggests the fearsome terror birds were more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>

          <p>An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office has advised that Chinese firms should become more deeply integrated with local economies in Southeast Asia. This recommendation comes as the U.S. cracks down on transshipments, where goods are rerouted through other countries to avoid tariffs, with President Trump warning of a 40% levy on products diverted through nations like Vietnam. By establishing genuine local operations rather than just using countries for transshipment, Chinese businesses can create more stable, long-term investments. This strategy would help them navigate unpredictable tariff policies and contribute more meaningfully to regional economies. (not investment advice)</p>
