          <h2>New Research Suggests Personality Traits Can Be Intentionally Changed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:13:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer Olga Khazan, dissatisfied with her anxious and introverted personality, embarked on a year-long journey to consciously redesign her traits. This process, detailed in her book "Me, But Better," involved stepping outside her comfort zone with activities like improv comedy. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that personality is not fixed and can be shifted by intentionally and repeatedly changing one's patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The article suggests that while the principles are simple, the execution requires significant and sustained effort.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:10:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies the biggest red flag in a job interview as a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company. She gauges this by asking what they think the company could do better. Conversely, she is most impressed by candidates who have done their research and can offer genuine, constructive feedback on the business. Johnson values problem-solvers who can adapt quickly, especially in a startup environment, and who are open about their past mistakes and learnings.</p>

          <p>In an interview discussing her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, recounts her trailblazing career and experiences with racism and sexism. She shares anecdotes, including a notable encounter with Senator Jesse Helms, and offers her perspective on the current political landscape. Moseley Braun argues that sexism is a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism and expresses concern that the Democratic party is struggling to effectively counter Donald Trump, while remaining optimistic about democracy's resilience.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to recognize and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article explains that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are foundational for mental health and success in life.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes they have found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured in 1721 by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, also known as La Buse. The ship, discovered off the coast of Madagascar, was carrying a vast treasure of gold, silver, and diamonds, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. This discovery could be a major breakthrough in the 300-year-old mystery of La Buse's legendary hidden treasure, which he cryptically alluded to just before his execution.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Penalty Kick Success Rates Have Dropped at Euro 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Euro 2025 women's football tournament has seen a historically low penalty kick success rate of just 58.5%, prompting analysis into the cause. Experts suggest several contributing factors, including increased psychological pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Additionally, improved professionalism, better data analysis, and advanced scouting mean goalkeepers are now more prepared than ever, often knowing a taker's tendencies in advance. This combination of heightened pressure and superior preparation is making penalties significantly harder to convert.</p>

          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released almost 300 pages of internal records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The documents, obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, reveal the foundation's active lobbying efforts to derail a public referendum on the project. This outcome sets a significant precedent, suggesting that private police foundations, which exist in most major U.S. cities, may no longer be able to operate as a "black box" shielded from public records laws.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and often underdiagnosed hormonal disorder, are reporting significant improvement in their symptoms after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. While not an approved use, the drugs' ability to promote weight loss and improve insulin sensitivity appears to indirectly help regulate hormones, leading to more regular menstrual cycles, hair regrowth, and reduced acne. Though larger clinical trials are needed, some health experts see these treatments as a potential game-changer for a condition with limited options.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acclaimed comic book author Grant Morrison pushes back against conservative criticism of Superman's immigrant identity by highlighting the character's socialist origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "champion of the oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and slum landlords. Morrison explains that the patriotic "Truth, Justice, and the American Way" identity was a later addition during World War II, and that the character has evolved to reflect the times, from a 1950s suburban patriarch to a 1980s yuppie.</p>
