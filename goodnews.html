He secured a three-bout lead after defeating Hakuoho, while his main competitor, Hoshoryu, lost to Kirishima. If Onosato wins against Kotozakura on Friday, he will clinch his fourth Emperor's Cup and earn promotion to sumo's highest rank.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. The initiative aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo and its vicinity. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry based on demonstration projects in Fukushima, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. This move is part of Japan's effort to recycle soil with relatively low radioactivity for public works and reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing from June 1, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to US tariffs. The decision stems from internal and external factors, with the sportswear giant citing regular "price adjustments." While not explicitly naming US tariffs, most of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will primarily affect shoes costing over $100, with clothing and equipment also seeing increases between $2 and $10. UK retailer JD Sports also anticipates that higher prices in the US market due to tariffs could impact customer demand.</p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring the use of airborne DNA (eDNA) to track the world's biodiversity. Researchers, including Elizabeth Clare and Nina Garrett from York University, are collecting eDNA using air filters to identify various species of insects, plants, fungi, birds, and mammals. This method could enable large-scale monitoring of biodiversity changes and assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The approach may also be used to identify pathogens and agricultural pests, turning air quality networks into global wildlife monitoring systems.</p>

          <p>Paul Elie's "The Last Supper" captures a pivotal moment in 20th-century social history, exploring the clash between religion, art, and sexuality in the 1980s. The book examines how artists like Andy Warhol, Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor, Bob Dylan, and Martin Scorsese grappled with religion in their work. Elie terms this art form crypto-religion, in which artists negotiated the ‚Äúliminal space between belief and non-belief,‚Äù. Elie's survey places the reader in the thick of a convulsive era when ideas about the role of religion in modern life were fighting it out in the public sphere in ways that we haven‚Äôt seen since.</p>
