          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a new agreement to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to reduce dependence on China. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a project pipeline worth up to $8.5 billion, though White House figures cited a different amount, indicating over $3 billion in investments in the next six months.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates cool to a three-year low, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to avoid several common mistakes. The article cautions against assuming rates will only continue to fall, as market fluctuations are unpredictable, and suggests acting if a current rate is affordable. It also highlights the importance of exploring alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages for additional savings. Finally, homeowners are encouraged to calculate the potential benefits of refinancing even if the rate reduction is less than the traditional one-percent benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the character of the nationwide "No Kings" protests, describing them not as radical mobs but as gatherings of ordinary, middle-aged, and older Americans motivated by a "good-natured indignation." The author observes a tone of old-fashioned patriotism and a desire to reclaim a sense of decency that they feel has been lost under the current administration. Contrasting the protesters' dignity with the president's vulgar response, the article suggests that this quiet, heartfelt movement offers a glimmer of hope for rousing a mainstream opposition to the perceived collapse of American values.</p>

The move came after AI-generated clips using Cranston's voice and likeness appeared on the app without his consent, prompting concerns about intellectual property and personal rights. OpenAI reiterated its commitment to protecting performers and its support for the NO FAKES Act, a federal bill designed to prevent the unauthorized AI replication of a person's voice or likeness.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming October meeting, savers are encouraged to lock in currently available certificate of deposit (CD) rates. While top CD rates have fallen from recent highs, they still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts. The article suggests specific strategies, such as using a 6-month CD for short-term gains or a longer-term CD for greater overall earnings and protection against future rate drops. Acting promptly is advised as banks may lower their offered rates even before the official Fed decision. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a "good deal" with China, analysts caution that the administration is unlikely to abandon tariffs as a key point of leverage in the ongoing trade dispute.</p>
