        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record, driven by investor optimism following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. Technology stocks led the rally, with analysts suggesting that investors are anticipating a new wave of fiscal stimulus from the next leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. This political shift is seen as potentially creating a more stable, pro-growth environment for the equities market in the long term, despite near-term volatility. Some analysts forecast further upside for the index in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in performance league tables, with specialist hospitals securing the top positions. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase transparency and identify where support is needed to end a "postcode lottery" in care. However, organizations representing the trusts have raised concerns about the methodology, warning that the rankings may not accurately reflect performance and could demoralize staff or skew priorities toward metrics over patient well-being.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates a 46% rise in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023, as more seniors turn to it for managing health issues like chronic pain and PTSD. With cannabis now legal in many states, the stigma is diminishing, and many older adults prefer edibles to smoking. However, some medical experts caution against the trend, warning that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may pose cardiovascular risks regardless of how it is ingested.</p>

          <p>To satisfy growing demand in its northeastern region, China is establishing a new fruit transit center and a dedicated shipping service dubbed the "durian express." The initiative, led by Liaoning Port Group, aims to significantly reduce transit times for fresh durians from countries like Malaysia and Thailand, cutting the journey to as little as six days. This development is designed to overcome logistical challenges and ensure fresher deliveries to a market that has been historically difficult to reach efficiently.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has approved a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from puppy mills by banning online pet brokers and middlemen who sell dogs to consumers. The legislation targets shadowy resellers who often misrepresent commercially bred animals as being from small, local breeders, closing a loophole in a 2019 law that barred pet stores from such sales. The bill, which now goes to the governor, is intended to increase transparency and protect both animals and consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines but has limited their authorization to adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with specific medical conditions that put them at high risk for severe infection. This more targeted approach differs from previous rollouts and may restrict access for healthier, younger people. The change raises questions about how doctors will handle off-label requests and how insurance companies will adjust their coverage policies for the new shots.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has voiced his frustration with the term "Bazball," used to describe his team's aggressive and fearless style of play. He stated that common misconceptions, which portray the team as simply swinging hard without strategy, are "slightly disrespectful" to the players and staff. McCullum clarified that his coaching philosophy is focused on creating an environment that frees players from the pressures of international cricket, rather than mandating a rigid, high-risk playing style.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that many recent negative sentiments on Wall Street concerning tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple have proven to be unfounded. He pointed to fears about an Alphabet breakup and concerns over Apple's AI strategy as examples of pessimism that dissipated without causing the feared damage. Cramer suggests that the market often overhypes negative narratives, and investors should be wary of jumping to pessimistic conclusions. (not investment advice)</p>
