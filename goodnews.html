          <p>Digital physical therapy company Hinge Health saw its stock rise after releasing its first quarterly report since its initial public offering. The company reported second-quarter revenue of $139 million, significantly surpassing analysts' expectations and marking a 55% increase from the previous year. While Hinge reported a substantial net loss, largely due to stock-based compensation expenses, it also showed strong client growth and issued an optimistic revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter and full year. The results signal investor confidence in the company's remote healthcare model. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed forecasts, driven by a significant 69% annual increase in its Client and Gaming segment. The data center segment, which includes its AI chips, also saw 14% growth as AMD positions itself as a key alternative to Nvidia.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that median home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops compared to three years ago, largely due to increased housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing notable increases. The data highlights a divided national housing market shaped by regional supply and demand dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Yreka, a small city in Northern California, were briefly ordered to shelter in place after an industrial accident at a local cement plant released a large dust cloud. County officials issued the alert out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazard of airborne cement particles. The order, which advised residents to turn off air conditioning and stay indoors, was lifted in less than an hour after the cloud dissipated. Authorities have stated that any settled particles are safe to wash away and are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>A financial comparison explores whether a $10,000 deposit earns more in a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current market. While the top high-yield savings account rate is slightly higher, the difference in earnings over three months is negligible. The article notes that the CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, providing certainty in a climate of potential interest rate cuts. In contrast, the variable rate of a savings account could decline, making the choice dependent on an individual's risk tolerance and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, an article advises homeowners to ask critical questions before borrowing a large sum like $100,000 via a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Homeowners should consider the timing and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on their variable-rate HELOC payments, as the effect may be more gradual than anticipated. The article also suggests comparing a HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, which offers payment stability and may be better for large, immediate expenses. The guidance emphasizes a cautious and strategic approach to tapping into home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

Many leaders at rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, have roots at Yum, benefiting from its focus on leadership development and global operational scale. The company's culture, which can be traced back to its time as part of PepsiCo, fosters executive talent, though the intense internal competition for top roles often means executives must leave to become CEOs elsewhere.</p>
