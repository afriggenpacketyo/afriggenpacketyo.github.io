          <p>Tesla stock rebounded by approximately 5% following a $152 billion drop in market capitalization fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. Analysts cited a report that Trump scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce, though a White House official denied any interest in a call. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla shares are oversold and that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would benefit the stock. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump and President Xi Jinping had a "very positive" 90-minute phone call, signaling a potential cooling of US-China tensions over tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will lead future negotiations with China. Observers note a shift in Washington's approach, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for personal deal-making, while the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio from preparations and announcements suggests a diminished role in shaping bilateral ties. Direct engagements between leaders previously involved top diplomats, but this call reflects a new dynamic in US-China relations.</p>

          <p>The US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite economic headwinds from tariffs. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2% for the third consecutive month. The health care and leisure and hospitality industries saw the largest employment gains, while federal employment declined. Some experts caution that growth storm clouds are darkening, and stagflation remains a concern, while others believe that the modest job gains and steady unemployment rate are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines for the next few months.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a recent jobs report that exceeded expectations.

The president's public criticism of the Fed chairman has become a routine occurrence during his second term.
