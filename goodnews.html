          <p>EHang Holdings, a Chinese drone maker, projects that flying taxis could be used for public transport in China within five years and fixed-route air shuttle services by 2030. Conor Yang, EHang's CFO, said the company is conducting trial flights in Guangzhou and Hefei to gather data before launching services in designated areas later this year. EHang has already received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to operate autonomous passenger drones. The company's EH216-S aircraft is available for 2.39 million yuan (US$331,000) on Taobao, and there is strong overseas interest, particularly in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</p>

          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto and AI advisor, anticipates that the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support. He believes that providing a clear legal framework for stablecoins could unlock trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks noted that there is already over $200 billion in stablecoins that are currently unregulated. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, indicating strong potential for its passage.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaners as refugees, citing violence and discrimination, some Afrikaners dispute the claim of a 'White genocide' in South Africa. Commentator Piet Croucamp argues that Whites remain economically strong, holding a majority of boardroom positions and earning higher incomes than Black South Africans. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein echoed this sentiment, stating that a White genocide is not happening and that he feels safe on his farm. They suggest that the claims are circulated by right-wing groups and do not reflect the reality for most Afrikaners.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is renaming its digital entertainment division as Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, using the Chinese name for the orca, or killer whale. This rebranding is part of a broader effort to reinvigorate growth outside its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. Alibaba stated that orcas are flexible and smart, adapting to complex environments, which aligns with the entertainment group's pursuit of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness. The move adds to Alibaba's "zoo" of animal-themed businesses and reflects a strategy to return to its original mission and start a new business.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has jumped to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin was last higher by 2% at $108,955.10, according to Coin Metrics. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week. On-chain data also shows less selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Investors anticipate regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive bitcoin prices higher (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019. The sneaker giant stopped selling its goods wholesale on Amazon six years ago due to rising concerns around counterfeit products. A Nike spokesperson said the company is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers. Amazon said it will soon begin sourcing a much wider range of Nike products directly to expand its selection for U.S. customers.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while leasing back a crucial military base on the archipelago for 99 years. This agreement follows negotiations initiated by the previous government and addresses increasing international pressure to cede control. The Labour government defends the deal as the best way to guarantee the base's future and ensure UK national security. The move has faced criticism from Reform UK and some Conservatives, but the government will update MPs on the terms, including a potential 40-year extension to the base lease.</p>
