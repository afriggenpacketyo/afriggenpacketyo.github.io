        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, showed a 2.9% annual increase in August, matching July's figure and economists' expectations. However, the overall PCE index, which includes food and energy costs, ticked up slightly to 2.7% year-over-year. Despite inflation having cooled significantly from its recent peaks, it remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target, contributing to public concern about the economy. The data provides a critical backdrop as the Fed navigates decisions on interest rate cuts amid political pressure and concerns over the impact of new import tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill moving through Congress aims to change the terminology used for Social Security retirement benefits to help Americans better understand their financial options. The proposal would rename "early eligibility age" to "minimum benefit age" and "full retirement age" to "standard benefit age" to more accurately reflect the outcomes of claiming at these times. Proponents argue this clearer language will better communicate the financial implications of claiming benefits at different ages, potentially improving long-term retirement security for millions. The legislation advances amid ongoing debates about the program's solvency and potential future reforms.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a 2013 broadcast featuring Jimmy Kimmel, host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". In the interview, Kimmel reflects on his origins in comedy and the journey that led him to become a prominent figure in late-night television. The discussion also touches upon a significant controversy from his career, where his show was briefly suspended following comments he made regarding the assassination of political commentator Charlie Kirk. The reflection provides insight into the pressures and challenges of navigating free speech and comedy in the public sphere, especially in a highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Gold and Bitcoin are increasingly being utilized not just as market hedges but as sources of income through innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These financial products use strategies like covered calls to generate regular payouts for investors, appealing to those seeking steady returns in a volatile market where traditional bonds are less reliable. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Simplify are launching these ETFs to meet growing demand for portfolio diversification and income generation from traditionally non-yielding assets. While still small compared to traditional gold and Bitcoin funds, their emergence signals a significant shift in how investors approach alternative assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Gold Card" program, which grants U.S. residency, has seen a surge in interest from wealthy individuals globally after its price was cut from $5 million to $1 million. Immigration attorneys report that the new price point makes it highly competitive with similar "golden visa" programs in other countries, positioning the U.S. as an attractive destination. The program, which aims to raise federal revenue by issuing 80,000 cards, still faces legal and logistical hurdles, including how it will navigate existing visa backlogs. The high demand reflects a growing trend of the global elite seeking alternative residencies amid geopolitical instability.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump in value following President Trump's tariff announcement. The administration will impose a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, a move intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what it calls unfair foreign competition. According to a Bank of America analysis, this policy directly benefits Paccar, which manufactures most of its trucks in the U.S. but faces a price disadvantage against competitors building trucks in Mexico. The market's positive reaction reflects investor belief that the tariff will level the playing field for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The article provides current average rates for various loan terms and explains the operational differences between the two loan types. With the potential for rates to drop further if the Federal Reserve makes cuts, these secured loans remain an attractive, albeit risky, financing option. (not investment advice)</p>

Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven investment and a hedge against inflation, making it particularly attractive to investors during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Its price is influenced by a complex combination of supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and the policies of central banks. Because gold is priced in U.S. dollars, the currency's strength also plays a significant role in its daily fluctuations, making it a dynamic commodity. (not investment advice)</p>

The technology involves a helium-filled shell that lifts a generator into the sky, with power transmitted back to the ground via heavy-duty cables. The company plans further tests, with mass production and grid connection anticipated for 2026, marking a significant step in airborne wind energy.</p>

The club firmly stated that it is not for sale and that its majority owners, the family of Joe Lewis, are committed to driving on-pitch success. This series of rejected approaches follows the recent departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential sale. Despite the owners' public stance, the flurry of interest suggests that industry figures view the North London club as a potential acquisition target.</p>

          <p>One year after Tropical Storm Helene devastated Asheville's River Arts District (RAD), artists and business owners are focused on rebuilding, but a debate has emerged over the area's future. A national land use institute recommended relocating the creative hub away from the flood-prone French Broad River, a suggestion that has frustrated many local stakeholders. In response, a new organization, Unified RAD, has formed to advocate for resilient, flood-proof infrastructure and development that allows the artistic community to remain. The discussion highlights the tension between preserving the district's historic identity and mitigating the risks of future catastrophic flooding, all while facing pressures of housing affordability.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, represents a federal effort to address the U.S. housing shortage by encouraging the reform of restrictive local zoning laws. The article explains how local control over housing development often stifles construction, and while some states have intervened, federal action could have a broader impact. The proposed legislation encourages the creation of model zoning codes that allow for denser building and offers financial incentives to municipalities that increase their housing supply. This approach, similar to creating "special economic zones" for housing, could cut through complex local regulations and encourage construction where it is most needed.</p>
