          <p>A loss of libido is a common experience for many women after childbirth, influenced by significant physical, hormonal, and emotional changes, as well as the demands of new parenthood. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal struggle with decreased sex drive, emphasizing how open communication with her husband helped alleviate pressure and misunderstandings. Experts explain that postpartum healing, drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone, and associated physical changes like vaginal dryness can make intimacy painful. The article also notes that men can similarly experience a decline in sex drive during the transition to fatherhood, underscoring the critical need for honest dialogue and mutual understanding within relationships during this period.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to appear at a local ABC station's town hall, reversing his earlier withdrawal in protest of ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani's initial boycott was a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom, following threats from the Federal Communications Commission regarding Kimmel's criticism of the Trump administration. Disney, ABC's parent company, reinstated Kimmel's show after "thoughtful conversations," prompting Mamdani's change of heart. His actions underscored broader concerns about the chilling effect on free speech and the perceived cowardice of institutions in confronting authoritarian pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen medical research grants to UCLA, providing significant relief to the University of California system. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin found that the grant suspensions, citing allegations of campus antisemitism and other issues, likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act due to unspecific form letters. This injunction, which also affects other federal grants, halts a funding crisis that threatened vital research, including cancer and stroke studies, and potential layoffs. UC leaders are continuing negotiations with the administration over its demands and a proposed $1.2-billion fine, maintaining their commitment to academic freedom and non-discrimination.</p>

          <p>US comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night talk show after Disney, ABC's parent company, reinstated the program following its suspension. The suspension occurred after Kimmel made jokes about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, leading to threats from the FCC to revoke ABC's broadcast license and criticism from President Trump. Disney stated the initial suspension was due to "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, but after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, decided to bring the show back. While major affiliate groups like Sinclair plan to continue preempting the show, the reinstatement has been welcomed by free speech advocates and Kimmel's industry peers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest as part of the ancient tradition of pannage, which commenced in mid-September following a heavy acorn crop. This historic practice serves a vital ecological purpose, as the pigs safely graze on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. Verderers, responsible for overseeing the land, initiated the season, underscoring its importance for maintaining the health and husbandry of other livestock. Visitors are reminded to maintain a safe distance from the animals and drive carefully through the forest, as officials have previously reported incidents of pigs being struck by cars.</p>

          <p>India is committing $18.2 billion to its "Semiconductor Mission" with the ambitious goal of becoming a global chip major, aiming to build a full supply chain from design to fabrication. This initiative seeks to reduce import dependence and capture a larger share of the global electronics market, especially as supply chains shift from China. The country has approved 10 projects, including two fabrication plants, and boasts a strong pool of engineering talent. However, experts note significant hurdles remain, such as intense competition, the need for a deeper ecosystem beyond incentives, and challenges in intellectual property laws to compete with established chip-making nations.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 19:04:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats, is proposing that the UK government offer discount visas to US cancer scientists whose research has been jeopardized by Trump administration budget cuts. Davey plans to announce a new fellowship scheme aimed at attracting these scientists to the UK, framing it as an opportunity for Britain to lead globally in cancer research. This initiative follows the US government's decision to cut billions from biomedical research overheads, a move that American oncology experts warned would be devastating to scientific progress. The proposal is part of Davey's broader criticism of President Trump's "anti-science agenda" and his political rivals.</p>
