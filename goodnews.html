        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year, buoyed by increased sales to home improvement professionals which compensated for a decline in demand from do-it-yourself customers. The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, although sales fell slightly short of Wall Street projections, while investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped the retailer navigate current economic uncertainties. Lowe's anticipates total sales ranging from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion for the year, with comparable sales expected to remain steady or increase by up to 1%. Like its competitor Home Depot, Lowe's is focusing on attracting professional clients to counteract softer sales from individual consumers.</p>

          <p>China's military is exploring methods to counter the artificial intelligence capabilities of potential adversaries in future warfare scenarios. According to the PLA Daily, strategies involve targeting the data, algorithms, and computing capacity used in AI processing by enemy forces. Tactics include "polluting" data to reduce the accuracy of language models and employing "logical deception" to disrupt algorithmic learning, which could involve irregular drone maneuvers. These discussions highlight the PLA's focus on "deceptive warfare" to undermine an opponent's AI-driven combat skills.</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been identified in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The virus was found in samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023, though no human cases acquired within the UK have been reported to date. Health officials emphasize that the risk to the public remains "very low," but experts suggest this discovery reflects a broader trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding to new regions due to climate change. Measures such as eliminating standing water and using mosquito repellent are recommended to mitigate the risk.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, England. Judges unanimously rejected an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict camping without their permission. The judgment centered on the interpretation of a Dartmoor by-law granting the public access to commons for "open-air recreation," which the court determined naturally includes camping. This decision is expected to reignite discussions about public access to land in England, where a general right to wild camp on private land does not exist.</p>

          <p>Following the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, Robert Reich argues that the solution to the rising debt is to end the Trump tax cuts and increase taxes on the wealthy. He contrasts this with the current system, where the super-rich finance the government by lending it money, leading to increasing interest payments that disproportionately benefit them. Reich contends that the growing political power of the wealthy to lower their taxes is the underlying cause of the debt crisis, and taxing them would be a fairer and more effective solution.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the concept of soft power and its importance in international relations. It argues that while hard power (coercion and payment) may be effective in the short term, soft power (attraction) is more sustainable in the long run. The author contends that the Trump administration's rejection of soft power has weakened trust in the U.S. and created opportunities for rivals like China to gain influence. The article concludes that while American democracy is resilient, restoring lost trust will be costly and challenging.</p>

          <p>Southern California home prices experienced minimal growth in April, with the average price rising only 0.4% from March to $884,981. Economists attribute this stagnation to high mortgage rates, increased inventory, and economic uncertainty related to tariffs. The annual price growth has slowed significantly compared to the previous year. Zillow forecasts a slight decline in home prices in the Los Angeles-Orange County metro area by April 2026, driven by an increase in the number of homes for sale.</p>

          <p>Kimberly Belflower's Tony-nominated play, "John Proctor Is the Villain," offers a contemporary reinterpretation of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible." Set in a high school classroom, the play follows students as they challenge traditional interpretations of Miller's work and explore themes of gender politics and personal experiences. Belflower's play, influenced by the #MeToo movement and Stacy Schiff's book on the Salem witch trials, encourages a deeper conversation about the complexities of the classic American drama. The production is directed by Danya Taymor and stars Sadie Sink.</p>
