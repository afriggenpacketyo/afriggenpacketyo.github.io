          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen Delaware, the state central to his political career, as the site for his future presidential library. A 13-person governance board, including former senior aides and political allies like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been established to oversee the project. The library aims to be a center for history, learning, and civic leadership, though it faces significant fundraising challenges in a divided political climate. The cost is expected to be substantial, following the trend of increasingly expensive presidential library projects.</p>

          <p>A 1962 Aston Martin DB4, valued at over $324,000, has been discovered in a New York barn where it sat untouched for three decades. The classic car was gifted to its previous owner in the 1970s as a thank-you for his work at a body shop, but his plans to restore it never materialized. The vehicle, which still has its original matching-numbers engine, represents a significant find for collectors. Once known as the first production car to go from 0 to 100 mph and back to 0 in under 30 seconds, the DB4 is now a prized relic awaiting restoration.</p>

          <p>A landmark agreement at California's Point Reyes National Seashore will see 12 dairy and cattle operations cease, opening over 16,000 acres for a major conservation effort led by The Nature Conservancy. The deal, which involved a multi-million dollar buyout for the ranchers, aims to restore the region's biodiversity after decades of conflict between agricultural and environmental interests. The restoration plan will use targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plants and re-establish native grasslands. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, it marks a new chapter for ecological healing in the biodiversity hotspot.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in an official Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, signaling a significant shift in their relationship with the Catholic Church. The event, celebrated with a Mass by a high-ranking Italian bishop, was seen by many as a culmination of the welcoming tone set by the late Pope Francis. Participants contrasted the current atmosphere with past Holy Years, where they felt shunned or were even detained. This pilgrimage reflects a growing sense of inclusion, which advocates hope will be continued under the new pontiff, Pope Leo.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a locked magnetic bag system, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches upon entering school, which can only be unlocked at designated magnetic stations at the end of the day. While educators report increased student engagement and a more positive social environment, the system has received mixed reactions from students, some of whom are attempting to bypass the restrictions. The initiative aims to reduce distractions and create a culture change in schools.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes, in a South Carolina forest. Now, a team of forensic genealogists is working to identify these forgotten soldiers in what they call "the ultimate cold case." By extracting DNA from the 240-year-old bones, they have built genetic profiles and are asking potential living descendants to submit DNA samples to help confirm identities. In 2023, twelve of the Continental soldiers were reburied with full military honors, bringing long-overdue recognition to America's first soldiers.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will conduct its second national test of the emergency alert system on Sunday, September 7, at around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. The alert will cause compatible phones on 4G and 5G networks to vibrate and emit a siren sound for about 10 seconds. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical glitches, which the government says have since been addressed. Users can opt out of the alerts through their phone's settings.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare, live-streamed exploration of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named "Emmy" descended over 1,500 feet, providing a unique look at the lakebed's ecosystem. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique geography and the importance of conservation efforts. While the dive debunked myths of mobsters' bodies, it highlighted the challenges of pollution and the need to protect the ancient and clear waters of the iconic lake.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has unveiled a comprehensive plan to boost PepsiCo's performance, outlining its proposals in a letter to the company's board. The plan calls for greater focus on core brands, divesting underperforming assets like Quaker, and refranchising the bottling network for its North American beverage business. Elliott argues these strategic shifts will correct past missteps, improve operational efficiency, and unlock significant value for shareholders. The firm believes its plan could result in at least a 50% upside in PepsiCo's stock, which has underperformed its peers in recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting, even though she has the financial means to purchase a home outright. After owning four properties, she and her husband sold them all and returned to renting, a decision she says has made her wealthier and less stressed. Joy argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, including maintenance, renovations, and taxes, which are often underestimated. For her, the flexibility of renting and the ability to invest capital in the market instead of real estate has proven to be a more profitable and lifestyle-compatible choice.</p>
