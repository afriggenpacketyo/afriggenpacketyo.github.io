          <p>San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is listed as questionable for the season opener against the Seattle Seahawks due to a calf issue. Despite not practicing on Friday, McCaffrey told reporters he feels great and plans to play, downplaying concerns that this could be a repeat of last season's injury-plagued year. This situation has caused apprehension among fans, given that a similar calf tightness issue last year led to him missing most of the season. The team's playoff aspirations are heavily dependent on his health and performance.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. District Judge Edward Chen's decision blocks the Department of Homeland Security's move, allowing approximately 1.1 million migrants to continue living and working legally in the U.S. for now. The judge stated the revocation was unprecedented and violated the law, given the dangerous conditions in the migrants' home countries. The Department of Homeland Security has indicated it will appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>California has officially joined the Northwest Wildland Fire Fighting Compact, a collaborative agreement with twelve other U.S. states and Canadian provinces to share firefighting resources and technology. This move aims to bolster the state's ability to combat increasingly severe wildfires, which are fueled by climate change. The partnership is also seen as a strategic response to recent staff and budget cuts at the U.S. Forest Service by the Trump administration. Governor Gavin Newsom stated that joining forces will make the collective more effective in protecting communities from catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant variation in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per year, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50. According to a LendingTree analysis, this spending constitutes a notable source of state revenue, accounting for up to 3% in some states like Rhode Island and South Dakota. An expert suggests that accessibility and urbanization play a role in the spending disparities between states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new draft of a major Senate crypto bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, has been updated with a provision to prevent tokenized stocks from being regulated as commodities. The bipartisan bill aims to establish a clear regulatory framework, defining when digital assets fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC versus the CFTC. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill could reach the president's desk by the end of the year. This legislation is considered a top priority for the crypto industry, following the passage of a stablecoin bill earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant advises potential winners on how to manage their newfound wealth. The expert suggests that while taking a lump sum payment is tempting, it can be "dangerous" for those unaccustomed to managing large sums, as many past winners have gone broke. The annuity option, paid over 29 years, is presented as a safer bet. The primary advice for a winner is to remain anonymous, assemble a team of legal and financial professionals, and begin by paying off all existing debts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, a former Alaska Airlines pilot, has pleaded guilty to charges related to his attempt to cut the engines of a passenger flight in October 2023.

In court, he expressed remorse for endangering the more than 80 people on board and damaging the reputation of his profession.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new designation for "state sponsors of wrongful detention," allowing the U.S. to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that hold American citizens for political leverage. The measure is modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation and provides tools like export controls and travel restrictions. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and has been praised by families of formerly detained Americans, such as the daughter of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. At least 54 Americans were reported as wrongfully detained in 17 countries during 2024.</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a lawsuit from authors who accused the company of illegally using their copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude. The settlement, which still requires judicial approval, would pay authors approximately $3,000 per work for an estimated 500,000 books. The lawsuit alleged Anthropic trained its AI on pirated copies of books from online "shadow libraries." This case sets a major precedent, signaling that AI companies may face significant financial consequences for using copyrighted material without permission or compensation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation, with Shohei Ohtani taking the mound against the Baltimore Orioles. Scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow was scratched due to back tightness, which the team hopes is not a serious issue. Ohtani, who had his own recent start postponed due to illness, volunteered to pitch on short notice, two days ahead of his next planned appearance. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team as they look to recover from a recent series sweep.</p>

          <p>China's biotechnology industry has made significant strides in catching up to the United States, largely driven by major regulatory reforms initiated in 2015. A pivotal moment was a "self-inspection" initiative that year, which led to the withdrawal of nearly 80% of pending drug applications due to flawed data, marking a shift from generic drugs toward innovation. This crackdown improved the quality and reliability of clinical data, with a rising share of Chinese data now receiving a "No Action Indicated" rating from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The scoutmaster, trained in search and rescue, recognized the man's distress, provided aid, and used a satellite device to call for a helicopter evacuation.

Having coached only four games, Tuchel's tenure has seen fewer matches and debutants compared to his predecessors in a similar timeframe. Tactically, England has shown a preference for a ball-dominant, physically imposing style, often utilizing a 4-4-1-1 formation that shifts in possession. While key performance metrics show some signs of a more aggressive pressing style, the team's definitive identity is still considered a work in progress.</p>
