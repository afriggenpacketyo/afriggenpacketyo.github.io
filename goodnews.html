          <p>Kansas City, Missouri, is grappling with a significant increase in its homeless population, prompting the city to implement a new strategy aimed at achieving "functional zero," where individuals experiencing homelessness are back on their feet within 30 days. The plan involves coordinating resources from churches, aid organizations, and shelters to provide comprehensive support, including housing and addressing addiction and mental health issues. Outreach coordinators are working to build trust with the unsheltered, and the city hopes to align resources to get people a place to stay while supporting their needs. One couple, previously living in an encampment, is now moving into a new home through a federal voucher program, highlighting the potential for positive change.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to Saudi Arabia, President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to provide economic relief to the war-torn country and foster stability in the Middle East.

The announcement was met with cheers at a business forum in Riyadh, and Syrians celebrated in major cities, expressing hope for economic recovery and reintegration into the global financial system.

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how former President Biden's aides allegedly suppressed concerns about his age and cognitive decline during his time in the White House. The book recounts instances of Biden forgetting names of longtime aides and allies, as well as appearing frail in meetings. Despite these observations, few Biden allies spoke openly about his decline, even after he withdrew from the presidential race. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of many claims, but it paints a picture of an inner circle that avoided addressing the president's diminishing abilities.</p>

The decision has sparked debate about whether their achievements outweigh their transgressions, as Hall of Fame voters are instructed to consider a player's integrity and character. The Hall of Fame stated that anyone removed from Baseball's permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.</p>

          <p>Golfers like Scheffler, Spieth, and DeChambeau have commented on Rory McIlroy's form at Quail Hollow. McIlroy became just the sixth player to win all four majors with his triumph at Augusta National - a result that has had Scheffler purring. Spieth arrives this week in search of the only title missing from his majors resume. Another American keen to add to his major tally of two this week is DeChambeau. The 31-year-old is enjoying a good run in the majors, having finished runner-up to Schauffele in last year's US PGA before pipping McIlroy to the following month's US Open title.</p>

The proposal entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use</p>
