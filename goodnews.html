Von der Leyen stated that Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly to reach a good deal, requiring time until July 9. The EU trade chief, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, responded that trade relations must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. The increase would dramatically raise Washington‚Äôs current tariff baseline levy of 10% to 50%, and fuel simmering tensions between two of the world‚Äôs economic heavyweights.</p>
