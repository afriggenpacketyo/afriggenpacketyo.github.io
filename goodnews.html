          <p>A former Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus, believes Israel's recent airstrikes against Iran significantly damaged Tehran's regional deterrence.  He highlights the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah as a result of the October 7th massacres and asserts that Iran is currently at its weakest militarily and politically. Conricus suggests that this could alter how other Middle Eastern nations respond to Iranian demands.  The article also discusses the international reaction to the strikes, with some countries expressing support for Israel's actions despite criticizing the operation itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump's highly anticipated military parade, celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, proved underwhelming for many. While the event showcased military might, it lacked the grand spectacle some expected, and the tone was more reminiscent of a historical presentation than a display of power.  The article contrasts the event with previous military parades and highlights the context of recent political events and protests, which overshadowed the parade's intended message. The author concludes that the Army successfully maintained message discipline, focusing on its history and service to the country.</p>
