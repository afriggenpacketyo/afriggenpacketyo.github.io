          <p>Korean Air has finalized a significant deal to purchase 103 Boeing jets, valued at approximately $36 billion, shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with US President Trump. This agreement, which encompasses 787, 777, and 737 passenger and cargo planes, is intended to modernize Korean Air's fleet, especially as it merges with Asiana Airlines. The deal is announced amidst ongoing discussions to address US tariffs on South Korea and is seen as a win for American firms, supporting an estimated 135,000 jobs across the US. This follows similar large orders from Japan and Indonesia, reflecting a broader pattern of trade partners increasing business with American companies.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have executed a surprising trade, sending quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This move was prompted by the Raiders' urgent need for a backup quarterback following Aidan O’Connell's wrist injury, bringing in Pickett who has 25 NFL starts. Pickett himself had been competing for a backup role in Cleveland, with Deshaun Watson sidelined by injury, but a hamstring issue in training camp complicated his position. The trade now leaves the Browns' second-string quarterback spot behind starter Joe Flacco open for competition between rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders as the roster deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a crucial warning regarding cordless hair styling tools powered by lithium-ion batteries or gas/butane fuel. These devices are strictly prohibited in checked luggage due to their inherent combustible nature and the significant risk of overheating or combustion in the aircraft's cargo hold. To ensure passenger safety, these tools are only allowed in carry-on bags, enabling immediate response from passengers or flight attendants if an incident occurs. The Federal Aviation Administration's data, showing hundreds of lithium battery incidents on flights, underscores the importance of adhering to these vital safety regulations.</p>

Despite the 45-year-old American staging a spirited comeback in the second set, Muchová ultimately secured a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory at Flushing Meadows. Williams, who was competing in her first Grand Slam in two years, received a warm and appreciative ovation from the crowd as she exited Arthur Ashe Stadium. Her departure leaves questions about whether she will return to play on the court where she previously won two of her seven major singles championships.</p>

This successful initial public offering underscores Hong Kong's vibrant IPO market, particularly for companies within the booming electric vehicle and battery sectors. Chairman Yang Rui attributed the company's strong performance to capitalizing on the waves of artificial intelligence and overseas expansion, aiming to leverage demand in Southeast Asia and the Middle East to foster a globally competitive business.

          <p>Attendees at this year's Burning Man event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert are contending with challenging weather conditions, including significant dust, strong winds, and a 30-60% chance of thunderstorms and small hail from Monday to Wednesday. Approximately 80,000 participants are expected at the event, with social media already showing videos of high winds and dust clouds impacting the temporary city. While some forecasted rain could help reduce the dust, these weather patterns are typical for the region's monsoon season. Organizers and attendees are preparing for potential disruptions, recalling last year's event which saw heavy rains cause substantial delays during the exit.</p>

The mission aims to test fixes and upgrades after three previous catastrophic failures, with a successful flight crucial for future goals like autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers for NASA's moon landing mission by 2027 and eventual Mars flights. Despite skepticism about meeting the 2027 moon deadline, SpaceX founder Elon Musk remains confident in achieving these complex engineering challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to fully restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally-allocated education funding, following a multi-state lawsuit spearheaded by California's attorney general. These vital funds, which were abruptly withheld without clear explanation, are designated for crucial programs such as after-school initiatives, summer learning, teacher training, and support for English-learners, predominantly benefiting low-income families. The states' lawsuit argued that the impoundment was illegal, violating the US Constitution and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. This agreement represents a significant victory for states challenging the administration's attempts to influence public education policies and ensures continued support for essential educational services nationwide.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian federal judge has issued an injunction that temporarily suspends an antitrust watchdog's order to halt the long-standing "soy moratorium" program. This two-decade-old private pact is crucial for protecting the Amazon rainforest by preventing soybean traders from sourcing from farmers who cleared land after July 2008. The antitrust watchdog, CADE, had previously ordered the program's suspension due to concerns over companies sharing commercially sensitive information. However, the judge sided with Abiove, a lobby representing oilseed crushers, ruling that the suspension will remain until a full CADE panel delivers its final decision on Abiove's appeal, indicating an ongoing legal and environmental battle.</p>

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states the risk to US public health is currently "very low," authorities have previously issued advisories as the parasite has been detected moving northward.

The article emphasizes that dynamic movement, strength, and stress management are more effective than relying solely on ergonomic gadgets or forced upright positions for long-term back care.</p>
