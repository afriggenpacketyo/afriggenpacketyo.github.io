        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build AI "gigafactories" to bolster its technological sovereignty and catch up with the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence race. The bloc has committed an initial €20 billion to fund these facilities, which are designed to be one-stop shops that combine computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models. Despite having a large pool of AI researchers, Europe has lagged due to limited computing capacity, a challenge these new, powerful data centers aim to solve. However, concerns remain about the need for significant private investment and the immense power grid requirements for these facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their actions in rescuing migrants from small boats in the English Channel. Facing accusations of operating a "taxi service," the crew emphasizes their mission is purely humanitarian, driven by compassion to save anyone in distress at sea, regardless of politics. The charity released harrowing footage of a recent rescue to highlight the dangerous reality of their work, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy. Last year, such call-outs represented just over 1% of their total missions, but resulted in saving 58 migrant lives.</p>

          <h2>India Surpasses China as Top Smartphone Exporter to the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. for the first time, according to new market research. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell from 61% to 25%. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers shifting final assembly operations to India to serve the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on South Korea's new foreign policy chief, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China. In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, encouraging deeper pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call comes as Beijing seeks to reset relations with Seoul's new administration, which is viewed as more open to China than its predecessor. Both ministers agreed to work towards making the upcoming APEC summit a new turning point for strengthening bilateral ties.</p>

          <h2>China Implements Nationwide Subsidy to Boost Falling Birth Rate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 23:38:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has introduced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move expected to assist around 20 million families. This national initiative follows various local government pilot programs aimed at reversing the country's declining birth rate, which has persisted despite the abolition of the one-child policy. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, and the nation faces the challenge of being one of the world's most expensive places to raise children.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 23:04:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed new orders with manufacturer TSMC for 300,000 H20 AI chipsets, reversing a previous stance to rely on existing inventory due to robust demand from China. The move comes after the Trump administration allowed sales of the H20—a chip specifically designed for the Chinese market after earlier export restrictions—to resume. This decision was part of broader trade negotiations with China and has drawn criticism from some U.S. lawmakers concerned about national security. Nvidia needs to secure new export licenses, but the large order signals the company's intent to maintain its market presence in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A planned U.S. stopover for Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te has reportedly been canceled, a move that could ease tensions with Beijing and potentially clear a path for a meeting between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. According to the Financial Times, Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York en route to South America. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic reasons for the change, including typhoon relief efforts and regional developments. The cancellation is seen as a setback for Lai's Democratic Progressive Party and follows a broader pattern of navigating the delicate diplomatic relationship between the U.S., Taiwan, and China.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a new peace plan and humanitarian aid strategy for Gaza. This comes after Starmer presented a European-led proposal to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland, following the breakdown of U.S.-led peace talks. The plan, developed with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate relief and create a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. The move also occurs amid growing pressure from over 140 Labour MPs for the UK to immediately recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A recently discovered stone carving found at an altitude of 4,300 meters near the source of the Yellow River may be linked to Emperor Qin Shi Huang's legendary search for immortality. An archaeologist from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggests the inscription, which details a journey to the area, is the only known carving from the emperor's era that remains at its original site. The finding offers a rare, tangible connection to the historical accounts of the first emperor of a unified China, who famously dispatched expeditions across his empire in search of an elixir of life over 2,200 years ago.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, though unconventional, provided invaluable face time and strengthened a key diplomatic relationship. The meeting, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy, free-wheeling press Q&A, allowed Starmer to directly engage the president on critical issues like the Gaza crisis. Downing Street sees these interactions as crucial for aligning views, particularly hoping Trump's recent comments on Gaza signal a toughening stance that aligns with a new UK-France-Germany initiative. The visit underscores the unique, personality-driven nature of diplomacy with the current U.S. administration.</p>

The move aims to address the long-standing problem where reservations for coveted spots would be snapped up within minutes of becoming available online. Under the new system, would-be campers can enter a free drawing for reservations months in advance. To further level the playing field, unsuccessful applicants will receive points that increase their chances in future drawings, creating a more equitable access system.</p>
