          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary block on President Trump's proclamation that would prohibit foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argued that Trump's proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation and viewpoint discrimination against the institution after Harvard publicly refused to comply with demands made by the Trump administration. The government argued it does not trust Harvard to vet, host, monitor, or discipline foreigners, citing concerns about Harvard's "foreign entanglements" with the Chinese government. The judge questioned the government's arguments, stating that the concerns raised likely apply to more than just Harvard.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares increased after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. While Trump refers to the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the transaction is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AMD shares rose significantly after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target, expressing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcement. The analysts anticipate a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter. This expectation is tied to AMD overcoming the bulk of the $800 million in charges related to new U.S. license requirements for semiconductor exports to China and other countries. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack, which analysts believe is pivotal for AMD Instinct growth.

          <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that a grand jury can investigate allegations of clergy sexually abusing children, after the Camden diocese reversed its long-standing opposition. The diocese previously argued that a court rule prevented the state attorney general from impaneling a grand jury, but the new bishop ended the church's opposition. The court concluded the state has the right to proceed with its investigation and present evidence before a special grand jury. The Camden diocese has committed to cooperating with the effort, and the state attorney general's office praised the decision and reiterated its support for survivors of sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>Google has issued an apology and incident report for a major cloud outage that caused downtime for over 70 Google cloud services, disrupting third-party services and first-party products like Gmail and Google Calendar.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 67% of newlyweds took on debt to pay for their wedding, prompting experts to offer advice on smarter ways to borrow. While paying in cash is the ideal option, using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer can be a wise choice if you have a plan to pay off the debt within the introductory period. Personal lines of credit may also offer lower interest rates than credit cards, especially for those with good credit. Experts emphasize the importance of creating a plan for loan repayment to avoid debt getting out of control and affecting future financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Understanding potential monthly payments from a $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65 is vital for retirement planning. The current higher interest rate environment enhances the appeal of annuities, providing more attractive monthly payouts. Factors such as gender, life expectancy, interest rates, annuity type, and optional features influence the monthly income. Investing in a $400,000 annuity can provide financial security with guaranteed income, but it involves trade-offs like reduced liquidity and potential for higher returns from other investments.
