          <p>This article addresses the dilemma of using older computers that no longer receive Windows updates, posing security risks. It advises users to either keep the PC offline for tasks like word processing and organizing files or to remove all sensitive data, disable outdated browsers, and install strong antivirus software if occasional internet access is needed. The article also suggests repurposing the old computer by installing Linux, turning it into a home server, or donating/selling it responsibly, while emphasizing the importance of data security throughout the process. Finally, the article gives simple hardware upgrades that can extend the life of the computer, such as more RAM, an SSD, cleaning the dust, and thermal paste. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the significant decrease in drug overdose deaths in the US, with 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. The decline is attributed to factors like increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds supporting these programs. Despite the positive trend, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and the Trump administration's proposed cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat. The article emphasizes the importance of continuing efforts to address the public health crisis and offers hope for further progress.</p>
