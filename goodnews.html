          <p>According to a new World Bank report, Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking the highest growth rate in ten years, primarily driven by the oil and gas sector recovery and the tech and finance industries, while also expecting a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025. Despite this economic expansion, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, and inflation is expected to stay above 20% throughout the year. The report also highlighted the slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs, and the World Bank praised the government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, while also emphasizing the need for more and better job creation to achieve a $1 trillion economy by 2030.</p>

Captured in 1966, Peterson spent six and a half years in the "Hanoi Hilton" and made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind after his release. As ambassador, he focused on reconciliation, seeking accountability for missing Americans, and fostering economic ties, including negotiating a key trade agreement. Peterson also initiated the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness, and after his ambassadorship, he dedicated himself to preventing accidental childhood injuries throughout Asia, showing a commitment to transforming hate into hope and building bridges between former adversaries.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical uncertainty, and rising inflationary pressures. Investors are increasingly viewing gold as a safe haven asset amidst recessionary risks and downgrading of economic forecasts by institutions like the IMF. Central banks are also contributing to the surge by increasing their gold reserves, possibly due to fears of weaponization of the dollar system. However, experts caution that gold is not immune to price fluctuations, and major surges have historically been followed by significant falls, raising concerns about a potential market bubble.

          <p>Experts are debating the appropriate use of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, emphasizing that changes in health, not just weight, should be the primary goal. While these medications are effective, they are expensive, often not covered by insurance, and intended for long-term use, with potential side effects. The focus should be on reducing visceral fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Doctors need better ways to identify individuals with excess visceral fat, as BMI is a poor measure, and they need more data on safely discontinuing the drugs and adjusting dosages long-term.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices within a month to align with those charged in other high-income countries, threatening steep Medicare caps if they fail to comply. The administration plans to approach pharmaceutical companies to negotiate a "most favored nation" price based on available data, aiming to reduce prescription drug prices by 50% to 90%. The White House seeks price reductions across federal and private health insurance, targeting drugs with the biggest disparity between U.S. and foreign prices. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this approach, arguing it would stifle innovation and give foreign governments undue influence, while pharmacy benefit managers support efforts to lower drug prices.</p>

          <p>Scientists are in a global race to understand why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and Hyper K in Japan aim to uncover why matter prevailed over antimatter after the Big Bang. By firing beams of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and observing their transformations, scientists hope to find differences that could explain the imbalance between matter and antimatter, potentially leading to a transformative understanding of the Universe and humanity's place within it.</p>

          <p>Japan is experiencing a boom in gold investment as concerns rise over a global economic slowdown caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The benchmark price of gold has hit an all-time high in yen terms, and gold-linked products have become popular among investment trusts, while more people have started monthly investments in pure gold. The surge reflects investors' desire for a safe asset amid stock market volatility, driven by fears of economic turbulence.</p>
