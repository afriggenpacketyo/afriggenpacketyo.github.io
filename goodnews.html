          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights are expected to participate in the Budapest Pride march in large numbers, defying a police ban enacted under new legislation. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has been criticized for repressing civil liberties. Despite receiving support from over 30 embassies and members of the European Parliament, attendees risk facing misdemeanor charges and fines, highlighting the growing pressure on civil society in Hungary.</p>

For Ch√°vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, the fight represents a crucial comeback opportunity after a period of personal and professional struggles. For Paul, a victory would be another step toward silencing critics and solidifying his credentials as a serious boxer, moving beyond his origins as a social media influencer.</p>

          <p>A chief economist at China International Capital Corporation has argued that payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give China a significant advantage in the global stablecoin race. According to the economist, this platform-based digital money functions much like stablecoins and is effectively an extension of legal tender, backed by central bank funds and a mature regulatory framework. This perspective suggests China is already well-positioned to lead in an area of growing importance to the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>
