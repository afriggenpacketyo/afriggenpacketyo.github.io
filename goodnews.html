          <p>China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% in March, bolstered by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. While state-owned firms experienced a profit decline, private enterprises and those with foreign investments saw improvements. The improved profitability is attributed to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks, although challenges such as insufficient demand and declining prices persist.

The legislation would limit the deduction of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years.
