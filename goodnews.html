          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight, particularly rocket launches and landings, to understand the impact of the increasing frequency of these events. With companies like SpaceX launching rockets regularly, the noise pollution is becoming a concern for communities near launch sites. Researchers are analyzing sonic booms and other sounds generated by rockets to determine acceptable noise levels and ways to lessen disruptions. The research also explores the unique sonic boom patterns of rockets like the Falcon 9 and the potential noise impact of larger rockets like Starship.</p>

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, has become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing a 62-mile journey to raise awareness for shark conservation. Pugh swam multiple hours a day in the cold waters off Cape Cod, enduring challenging weather conditions, to advocate for the protection of sharks. He aims to change public perceptions of sharks, often negatively portrayed in media like the film *Jaws*, and highlight the threats they face from human activities. He described the swim as one of the toughest of his career, emphasizing the mental challenge of being aware of sharks in the water.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as underscoring the country's sovereignty amid strained ties with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to deliver the Speech from the Throne, a rare event last seen in 1977, after President Trump made suggestions about annexing Canada. The visit is viewed as a strategic move to assert Canada's distinct identity and independence from the United States, especially in light of trade disputes and Trump's remarks.</p>

          <p>Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, a Shark Tank investor and Trump supporter, disagreed with the Trump administration's plan to restrict Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. O‚ÄôLeary, who teaches at Harvard Business School, argued that international students are valuable assets who contribute to the American economy and that these are the brightest and the best from around the world, and they‚Äôre coming for the American dream. He urged President Trump and Harvard's president to reach an agreement, as the order leaves current international students in a precarious position.</p>
