          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its plan to shift its primary listing to the United States, a setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company's full-year earnings statement revealed a move towards a dual listing, with the main hub relocating to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This would enable Wise shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, as stated in their earnings announcement. Shares of Wise experienced a surge, trading almost 11% higher following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article challenges the narrative that trade with China significantly harmed American manufacturing, arguing that the negative effects have been exaggerated. The author references a comprehensive review that contends that populist narratives blaming Chinese trade for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. It highlights methodological issues in studies claiming a "China shock" and points out that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry. The author concludes that the real "shock" America faces is the resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. (not investment advice)</p>

Other wildfire-related bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss trade disputes and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Merz's top priority will be to establish a positive rapport with Trump, leveraging his conservative views and business background. Key topics on the agenda include trade, support for Ukraine, and NATO spending. Merz will likely emphasize his support for free trade and the need for European countries to be involved in peace negotiations regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. (not investment advice)</p>
