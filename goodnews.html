          <p>France has formally recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring at the UN that "the time for peace has come" and condemning the ongoing Gaza war. This action aligns with a growing wave of international recognitions, intensifying pressure on Israel amidst the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and West Bank settlement expansion. While G7 nations like the US and Germany did not attend the related UN summit, Israel criticized the recognition as rewarding Hamas. Macron emphasized the need for a two-state solution, a permanent ceasefire, and the release of Israeli hostages, outlining conditions for opening a French embassy in a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen Airport has reopened after a nearly four-hour suspension of all flights, caused by multiple unidentified drone sightings on Monday evening. Danish police confirmed the resumption of operations but stated they could not identify the type, number, or origin of the drones, with an investigation now underway. The incident, which authorities described as involving two to three large drones, led to at least 35 flights being diverted and significant disruption for travelers. Passengers are advised to expect ongoing delays and cancellations, with police scheduled to provide further updates on the situation in a subsequent press conference.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the common and often unspoken challenge of decreased libido after childbirth, affecting both new mothers and fathers. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal experience, emphasizing how physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and emotional adjustments can lead to a reduced desire for intimacy. Medical experts and therapists highlight that societal expectations, often linked to the six-week postnatal check, can create unrealistic pressure for couples to resume sexual activity. Open communication between partners, acknowledging these changes, and understanding that men also face emotional struggles in fatherhood are crucial steps for navigating this sensitive period.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to participate in a local ABC town hall, reversing his earlier withdrawal following the reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had protested Kimmel's suspension, which occurred after the FCC chair threatened ABC over Kimmel's critical remarks about the Trump administration's reaction to Charlie Kirk's death. Mamdani emphasized his stance against perceived authoritarianism and the importance of upholding press freedom, criticizing corporate leaders for prioritizing profit over constitutional responsibilities. With Kimmel's return, Mamdani can now use the platform to advocate for constitutional principles and stand up for free speech in the mayoral race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, temporarily alleviating a funding crisis that threatened the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Institutes of Health grants were suspended using unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The administration had previously rescinded these funds, citing allegations of campus antisemitism, race in admissions, and recognition of transgender identities, alongside a proposed $1.2 billion fine. UCLA denied these allegations, emphasizing the vital importance of the research, which includes critical cancer and stroke studies, for public health and scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show is set to return to air after Disney, ABC's parent company, reinstated him following a week-long suspension. The suspension was initiated after Kimmel made jokes concerning the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which Disney described as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." This move followed threats from the FCC chair to revoke ABC's broadcast license, igniting a significant national debate on free speech and censorship. Disney stated the reinstatement came after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, though some major affiliates, like Sinclair, plan to continue preempting the show with news programming.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has announced the 12 contenders for its annual Fat Bear Week 2025 competition, inviting the public to vote for the largest brown bear preparing for hibernation. The online event, running from September 23-30, highlights the critical importance of bears accumulating up to 700 pounds of fat to survive the winter, potentially reaching over 1,400 pounds. This popular competition, which began in 2014, also serves to make the remote park more accessible through livestreams of the bears in their natural habitat. Enthusiasts can follow the journey of various contenders, including past runner-up 32 Chunk, who is making a strong comeback despite a recent injury.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced 10 new astronaut candidates, comprising four men and six women selected from over 8,000 applicants, who will train for future missions to the International Space Station, the moon, and eventually Mars. This marks NASA's first astronaut class with a female majority, reflecting a diverse range of expertise including pilots, engineers, and a geologist. The candidates will undergo two years of rigorous training before becoming eligible for flight assignments. This new class joins NASA during a period of uncertainty, with Trump administration budget cuts and challenges to the Artemis moon program, yet officials remain committed to space exploration goals, including beating China back to the moon.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18.2 billion in its "Semiconductor Mission" to become a global chip manufacturing powerhouse, aiming to establish a full supply chain from design to packaging. This ambitious initiative is driven by a desire to reduce import dependence and capitalize on the global push for chip self-reliance, particularly after US restrictions on China. While India possesses a significant engineering talent pool, experts caution that success requires a deeper, long-term ecosystem, addressing challenges in talent retention, tax policies, and trade regulations. The government is offering substantial incentives and expanding support for electronic component manufacturing to foster domestic demand and attract international partners.

          <p>UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged the British government to offer discount visas and a fellowship scheme to US cancer scientists whose research grants were cut by the Trump administration. Davey criticized President Trump's "anti-science agenda" and the Reform UK party for applauding cuts to mRNA vaccine research, which he called "cruelty and stupidity." He argues that the UK should seize this opportunity to lead globally in the fight against cancer, filling the void left by US policies that have drawn concerns from experts about devastating biomedical research. This initiative aims to attract top scientific talent to the UK, bolstering its research capabilities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article urges comedian Jimmy Kimmel to return to his show undaunted, arguing that satirizing powerful figures like President Trump is a "patriotic duty" essential for resisting authoritarianism. The author contends that self-censorship, even by celebrities, sends a dangerous message that fear should dictate public discourse. The article criticizes the Trump administration's perceived redefinition of patriotism into a narrow, angry dogma, citing examples like Stephen Miller's divisive rhetoric. It highlights humor's inherent power to build camaraderie, alleviate fear, and effectively challenge autocrats, drawing historical parallels to regimes that suppressed comedians to manage dissent.</p>
