        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has concluded that a major power outage at Heathrow Airport was most likely caused by moisture entering an electrical component. The incident, which occurred at the North Hyde substation in March, resulted in a fire that led to the airport's closure the following day. This disruption caused thousands of flight cancellations and affected approximately 270,000 passenger journeys. The report explains that the moisture likely caused a short circuit, leading to sparks that ignited oil within the equipment.</p>

The administration had announced it would terminate the protections on September 2, much earlier than the February 2026 date set by the previous administration. The judge ruled that this early termination is unlawful, as it violates the required notice period and disrupts the lives of beneficiaries who have established jobs and enrolled in schools.
