          <p>Asia markets, particularly Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, saw significant gains, rising over 2% and nearing a four-year peak, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month. The tech sector contributed substantially to these gains, with companies like Nio and ASMPT experiencing strong rallies. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended its upward trend, reaching a 37-month high. Analysts suggest that declining deposit rates could shift funds into equities, and potential capital rotation from the US to China following Fed rate cuts may sustain this momentum.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, reacting to increased expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This "dovish pivot" by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference has led to the offshore yuan climbing significantly. Analysts now widely anticipate a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, shifting focus to the scale and pace of future easing. This development reflects global market reactions to US monetary policy signals and their impact on currency valuations.</p>

The 38-year-old Serb, returning after a six-week hiatus, acknowledged the "physical struggle" but attributed it to a lack of match practice rather than injury. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th major title, has increasingly focused his schedule on Grand Slam tournaments. American hopefuls Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz also advanced, continuing their bids to end the 22-year wait for a Grand Slam men's singles champion from the US.</p>

          <p>Airline booking systems are set for a major overhaul, transitioning from traditional reservation models to "offer and order management" systems, aiming for a more flexible and personalized customer experience. Companies like Flyr are developing features akin to e-commerce shopping carts, allowing varied flight and service selections within a single booking. This evolution will enable airlines to offer hotels, car rentals, and other services directly, competing more effectively with online travel agents. Riyadh Air, launching without legacy Passenger Service System technology, will be the first "digitally native" airline, spearheading this industry shift towards modern digital retailing.</p>
