          <p>ProCap Financial, led by Anthony Pompliano, has raised over $750 million and is going public through a SPAC, joining the growing trend of publicly traded bitcoin treasuries. The firm aims to hold up to $1 billion in bitcoin and generate revenue through a bitcoin-denominated financial services platform. Pompliano likened the rush into bitcoin treasuries to a bubble, stating that the trend works, despite potential risks. ProCap is among several ventures using reverse mergers to tap into public markets, indicating a surge in capital directed towards bitcoin-related investments (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>This Fox News article argues that Hamas's actions have led to unintended negative consequences for itself, Hezbollah, and Iran's "Axis of Resistance." The article claims that the US airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities are an example of Sinwar's plan being turned upside down. It states that Israel has successfully degraded Hamas and Hezbollah by eliminating key leaders and destroying infrastructure. The article concludes by suggesting that Israel will no longer tolerate threats to its existence and will continue to eliminate those threats with US support. </p>

Some argue this signifies a return to the historical dominance of Brazilian football, while others point to financial disparities favoring European clubs.

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who have an easier time getting their children to listen avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that promotes cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. The article provides alternative phrases to replace toxic ones, such as explaining reasons instead of saying "Because I said so," and inviting problem-solving instead of blaming. These shifts in language represent a deeper shift in how we view parenting, focusing on empathy and leadership rather than control and criticism. </p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan fell below 4,000 yen ($27) per 5 kilograms for the first time in around three and a half months. The government said the drop was due in part to the release of additional rice reserves, stating that "a clear message from the government is proving effective." Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has vowed to bring the average retail price of 5 kg of rice down to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June. Measures were put into place prohibiting the reselling of rice bought at retail stores to ensure that consumers have access to rice at stable prices. </p>

Dozens of plans under large insurers such as CVS Health , UnitedHealthcare , Cigna , Humana , Elevance Health and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to a series of actions that aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers. </p>
