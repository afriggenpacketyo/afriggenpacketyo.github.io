          <p>Zara owner Inditex experienced a slowdown in summer sales, reporting a 6% increase at constant currencies from May 1 to June 9, compared to 12% growth in the same period last year. The Spanish retailer's fiscal first-quarter revenues also missed expectations, coming in at 8.27 billion euros against an anticipated 8.39 billion euros. Inditex, which also owns Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, is viewed as an indicator of consumer sentiment, and the company acknowledged the current economic environment is difficult to predict. Inditex is monitoring the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., its second-largest market. Optimism around Inditex is tempered by economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his recent criticisms of Donald Trump, admitting that they "went too far." This follows a public disagreement between the two after Trump threatened Musk with "serious consequences" if he were to fund primary challenges against Republicans who voted for a controversial spending bill. Musk's criticism stemmed from Trump's proposed "big, beautiful" spending bill currently before Congress. Trump had labeled Musk as "disrespectful" and warned of unspecified repercussions if Musk interfered with the bill's passage. Musk's statement suggests a possible attempt to mend the relationship after their very public falling-out.</p>

          <p>Several Asian nations are progressively reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging. ASEAN has committed to promoting local currency usage in trade and investment to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. The world has also been cutting its reliance on the greenback, with the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves declining from over 70% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2024. The growing trend of de-dollarization is partly driven by the recognition that the dollar can be leveraged in trade negotiations.

          <p>Archaeologists excavating at Colonial Williamsburg uncovered the remains of four Civil War soldiers, not Revolutionary War soldiers as initially expected. The skeletons were found near a Revolutionary War-era gunpowder magazine, along with three amputated legs. The soldiers, identified as Confederate, died during the Battle of Williamsburg in 1862 and were buried in comfortable clothes with their arms crossed. Historians believe a makeshift hospital operated nearby, and they are working to identify the soldiers using hospital patient lists found in archives. The remains have been reinterred at a local burial ground.</p>
