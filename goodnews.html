          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, surpassing expectations. This growth was primarily driven by a surge in exports ahead of anticipated tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. Simultaneously, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in several foreign missions, indicating a continued commitment to international security efforts. The economic growth provides a positive outlook amidst global trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China, providing greater incentives to consumers upgrading their devices. This move is aimed at stimulating demand in a crucial market where Apple faces increasing competition from local rivals. Despite the latest increases not being substantial, they indicate Apple's continued efforts to galvanize sales amidst declining market share. The company's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year in the first quarter, prompting a need to address sales and supply chain concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a 7% fall in energy prices starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This change will reduce the annual bill for a typical household by ¬£129, although charities caution that many still struggle with energy costs and debt. The price cap, which affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, reflects a drop in international wholesale gas prices. While this offers some relief, analysts anticipate little change in prices come October, and many households are burdened by significant debt to suppliers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Mint is set to discontinue the production of pennies following a decree by President Trump, who deemed the small coin "so wasteful". The decision comes as the penny's production cost exceeds its value, with annual savings estimated at $56 million. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple of US currency since 1792, but its underutilization has prompted the move. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost, while others argue for its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production compared to the nickel.</p>
