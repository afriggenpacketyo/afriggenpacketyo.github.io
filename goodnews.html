          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, stating the move would further secure the steel industry. He believes the increased tariffs will prevent foreign steel companies from circumventing trade barriers, aiming to bolster the domestic steel market. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, describing it as a "partnership" where Nippon would invest $14 billion while U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh. The details of the deal's structure remain unclear despite Trump's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk vowed that his departure "is not the end" of DOGE and claimed that the program is on track to achieve $1 trillion in savings. Despite initial goals, DOGE's public-facing website states it has saved only $175 billion.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding the use of artificial intelligence in urban management, particularly through its "smart cities" initiative. Cities like Nanjing are employing AI-driven drone patrols to monitor potential crime hotspots and address blind spots ignored by human patrols. While China's progress in AI adoption is significant, the country faces governance challenges similar to those in other parts of the world, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. The Chinese leadership views AI as a crucial tool for economic transformation and improved governance.</p>

          <h2>Therapy Culture Linked to Rising Childlessness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Times opinion piece explores a potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing rates of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that redefining harm, abuse, and trauma to include emotional and relational struggles has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. This cultural shift, where adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents and expect them to be accountable for their mental health, may contribute to a fear of parenthood. The author proposes that the dread of parenthood stems from holding their own parents to unreachable standards.</p>

She emphasized that the photos of her breastfeeding during the race showcase that being an athlete and a mother are not mutually exclusive.

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.
