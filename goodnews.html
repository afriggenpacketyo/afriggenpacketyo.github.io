        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that animals be caught, sterilized, and immunized before release, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also prohibited public feeding of strays, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones to curb the estimated 800,000 to one million stray dogs. This decision follows widespread protests from animal rights activists who criticized the previous order for mass removal as impractical and inhumane. The court cited nearly 2,000 daily dog bite incidents in New Delhi and aims to frame a nationwide policy to address public safety and animal welfare.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate decreased to 3.1% in July, a slight dip from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest point since March but still exceeding economists' expectations of 3%. Headline inflation also fell to 3.1%, the lowest since November 2024, with "core-core" inflation holding steady at 3.4%. A significant factor in the moderation was easing rice inflation, which dropped to 90.7% from 100.2%. Despite the cooling, the Bank of Japan faces pressure to raise interest rates, as inflation remains above its 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, impacting purchasing power.

          <p>Morecambe Football Club's recent takeover by Panjab Warriors marks a historic milestone, establishing it as the first professional English club under Sikh ownership. Concurrently, the appointment of 30-year-old Ashvir Singh Johal as manager signifies the first Sikh boss of a professional British club. This dual breakthrough is viewed as profoundly significant for the Sikh community, which has historically been underrepresented in British football. The Panjab Warriors group intends to integrate Sikh principles of discipline, trustfulness, and compassion into the club's operations, aiming to attract a wider global Sikh diaspora fanbase. This increased representation is expected to inspire future generations within the community to pursue diverse careers, including those in sports.</p>

          <p>A new report by the World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization warns that extreme heat, exacerbated by climate change, poses significant health risks and reduces productivity for millions of workers globally. The article emphasizes that rising temperatures, with 2024 being the hottest year on record, are leading to increased heat stress, strokes, kidney failure, and accidents in workplaces. The WHO calls for governments, employers, and workers to collaborate on adaptation strategies, citing examples from Italy and Switzerland where work pauses and building renovations are being considered. The report stresses that ignoring these issues will be the most expensive solution in the long run.</p>

Under the new guidelines, claimants will generally lose eligibility if they are abroad for more than eight weeks, though exceptions exist for specific situations like medical treatment or family bereavement. A dedicated team, now expanded to over 200 investigators, will leverage travel data to identify and address incorrect payments. This initiative builds on a successful pilot that recovered £17 million from 2,600 ineligible claimants, and the government intends to extend similar scrutiny to other benefits claimed overseas.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged Pakistan to accelerate the "2.0 upgrade version" of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), emphasizing cooperation in agriculture, industry, and mining. During a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Wang reiterated China's role as Pakistan's "most reliable partner" and pledged support to enhance its self-development capabilities and resilience against external challenges. Sharif, in turn, expressed Pakistan's interest in expanding collaboration to aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while also committing to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals and projects from terrorist attacks. CPEC, with over US$65 billion in Chinese investment, is a cornerstone of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>Adidas executives have issued a public apology to the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for culturally appropriating their traditional huarache sandal design in its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe. The company admitted the design, created by Mexican American designer Willy Chavarria, closely resembled the community's traditional handicrafts, which are vital to their livelihood. This apology follows national attention and criticism from President Claudia Sheinbaum, who advocated for stronger protections against global brands copying Indigenous designs. Adidas has pledged future collaboration with the town, marking a significant step in recognizing collective intellectual property and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Kansas health officials are actively monitoring six West Nile virus cases this year, with five classified as neuroinvasive, indicating severe central nervous system involvement and more extensive medical intervention. While the current numbers remain below last year’s total of 64 infections and four deaths, authorities warn that the risk of transmission will rise significantly as mosquito activity peaks in late summer. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment provides a public dashboard, updated weekly from July through September, to track cases across the state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that most individuals infected with West Nile virus recover and are believed to develop lifelong immunity, though no specific medicines are available for treatment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the Trump administration and the state of Florida to halt further transfers of detainees and effectively wind down operations at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Everglades. The ruling, a significant setback for Trump's immigration policies, cited violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and the risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and its endangered species. The judge mandated the removal of temporary infrastructure, including fencing, lighting, and waste receptacles, within 60 days.

This comes amidst discussions about the U.S. administration potentially acquiring equity stakes in tech companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, though a Wall Street Journal report indicated no such plans for firms significantly increasing U.S. investments, like TSMC with its $165 billion U.S. expansion.

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including industry giants Toyota and Honda, have explicitly denied directly passing the costs of U.S. tariffs onto American car buyers. This contradicts a Nikkei Asia report that suggested Japanese automakers were shifting some tariff expenses to consumers, despite the U.S. initially imposing 25% tariffs on automobiles, which were later reduced to 15% after a trade deal. Toyota clarified that its recent price increases were standard annual adjustments reflecting various operational costs, not a direct response to tariffs, aiming to maintain vehicle affordability. Honda similarly attributed any price changes to enhanced feature content, highlighting its ability to absorb tariff impacts due to a high percentage of American-made vehicles.

          <p>Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has been acquitted of royal defamation charges that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence, easing a significant legal threat to his political dynasty. A Bangkok court found insufficient evidence to convict him for remarks made in a 2015 interview concerning the 2014 coup that removed his sister from power. This ruling is considered unusual, as acquittals in lese majeste cases, which criminalize criticism of the monarchy and carry severe penalties, are rare in Thailand. The verdict allows Thaksin, who remains a central figure in Thai politics, to navigate a complex political landscape where his family's influence has recently waned.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has made a significant discovery, revealing that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This groundbreaking research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, offers crucial insights into how planting density affects both plant growth and defense mechanisms. The study, conducted in maize fields in Hainan, China, demonstrated that corn plants in densely planted inner rows suffered less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth compared to those at the edges. Optimizing the release of this natural chemical could potentially be leveraged to combat agricultural pests and significantly increase crop yields, benefiting global food security.</p>
