        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are poised for a positive open on Thursday as investors react to the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate reduction. The Fed cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points, placing it in the 4.00%-4.25% range, a decision met with less internal dissent than expected. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell tempered investor enthusiasm for aggressive future cuts, characterizing the move as "risk management" and forecasting only two more reductions this year, followed by one in 2026. This monetary policy shift is influencing global markets, with Japan's Nikkei rising and the Bank of England also preparing its own interest rate announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Blake Snell delivered his most dominant performance in a Dodgers uniform, pitching seven scoreless innings with a season-high 12 strikeouts to secure a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite manager Dave Roberts approaching the mound in the seventh, Snell successfully advocated to remain in the game, culminating in a crucial strikeout. This stellar outing provided a much-needed respite for the Dodgers' beleaguered bullpen, which had been under recent scrutiny. Offensive contributions included a home run from Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani's 51st homer of the season, making the relief corps' task refreshingly simple. The team aims to replicate this strong pitching and supportive offense as they continue their season.</p>

          <p>The European Union and China's parliaments are scheduled to hold their first joint talks in seven years on October 16 in Brussels, marking a notable diplomatic shift. This meeting, recently approved by the European Conference of Presidents, aims to re-establish a biannual exchange, with a Chinese delegation traveling to Brussels and European Members of Parliament slated to visit Beijing in May 2026. German lawmaker Engin Eroglu is expected to lead the European side, though the full agenda awaits confirmation. This development represents a significant improvement in relations, which had deteriorated to the point of exchanging sanctions in March 2021 over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has officially formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the end of an unusual nearly three-week period without named storms during the peak of hurricane season. Currently positioned almost 900 miles from the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands with sustained winds of 50 mph, Gabrielle is projected by the National Hurricane Center to intensify into a hurricane by Sunday. Although the United States is not expected to experience direct impacts, the storm could generate high surf along the East Coast next week. This system is the seventh named storm of the season, notably forming about two weeks later than the typical schedule, primarily due to atmospheric factors such as dry air and strong wind shear that have previously inhibited tropical development despite warm ocean temperatures.</p>

This enhanced alliance emerges amidst growing apprehension among Gulf Arab states regarding the United States' reliability as a security guarantor, especially after Israel's attack on Qatar. The pact also underscores Saudi Arabia's diplomatic role, as it reportedly helped de-escalate a tense four-day conflict between nuclear powers Pakistan and India earlier this year, highlighting the intricate and evolving geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>

          <h2>Kamala Harris Reveals Pete Buttigieg Was Her First Choice for 2024 Running Mate</h2>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in an excerpt from her forthcoming book "107 Days," reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for her 2024 running mate, but concluded that America was not yet ready for such a pairing. She writes that Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner "if I were a straight white man," recognizing the significant challenge of presenting a ticket with a woman, a Black woman, and a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Harris ultimately selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz after former President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race. This excerpt provides a candid look into the complex strategic considerations and perceived societal readiness during her condensed presidential campaign.</p>

          <h2>China's Central Bank Expected to Exercise Moderate Easing After Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 22:28:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's initial interest rate cut of the year, analysts project that China's central bank will likely pursue only moderate easing measures, despite having greater flexibility post-Fed action. On Thursday morning, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) adjusted the yuan’s midpoint rate to 7.1085, a slight depreciation from the previous day. The Fed's decision to cut its benchmark borrowing rate by 25 basis points, placing it in the 4-4.25% range, briefly caused the offshore yuan to strengthen. Economists, such as Ding Shuang of Standard Chartered Bank, forecast a more restrained rate cut pace from the PBOC, anticipating this will narrow the interest rate differential and ease capital outflow pressures, thereby supporting the yuan's stability.

          <p>USC defensive coordinator D’Anton Lynn has clarified that he has not been approached by UCLA regarding their vacant head coaching position, despite widespread speculation placing him among the top candidates. Lynn, who previously made a significant impact by transforming UCLA’s defense before his move to USC, firmly reiterated his current focus is entirely on preparing the Trojans for their upcoming matchup against Michigan State. After signing a substantial contract extension with USC in January, Lynn has continued his impressive work, elevating their defense from 121st nationally to a respectable 56th last season. While he acknowledged aspirations for a head coaching role in the future, Lynn stressed the importance of remaining concentrated on his immediate responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, laden with over 11,000 pounds of essential equipment and supplies for the International Space Station, experienced a delay in its planned rendezvous following two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed that the issue, attributed to a conservative safeguard within the software settings, has since been successfully resolved, and the cargo ship is now expected to arrive on Thursday morning. Astronaut Jonny Kim, with support from NASA astronaut Zena Cardman, will utilize the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm for the capture. This mission represents the maiden flight of the upgraded Cygnus XL, designed to transport a substantially larger volume of cargo, including critical spare parts and crew provisions, after an earlier vehicle suffered damage during transit.</p>

          <p>This opinion article advocates for China to cultivate more diverse career paths for its youth, encouraging them to look beyond the highly competitive and often rigid traditional academic system. It spotlights the unconventional journey of Gong Sheng, who, despite his academic prowess, found a "spiritual awakening" in cooking and is now pursuing a culinary program. The article suggests an encouraging trend: more young Chinese individuals are confidently pursuing their passions, supported by their families and society. This shift contrasts with earlier times when such choices were viewed as anomalies, exemplified by the famous case of Lu Buxuan, a Peking University graduate who ultimately became a butcher.</p>

Featured examples include Campillo's "Repetición," which incorporated a philosophical poem, Eckhaus Latta's show with its blend of poetry and live electronic music, and Diotima's "Bacchanal," which transported onlookers to the vibrant Caribbean Carnival.

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a pioneering initiative, "AI Fluency," which mandates that all freshmen, beginning with the class of 2029, study artificial intelligence, embedding AI lessons across every major. The program's objective is to ensure that graduates are proficient in both their chosen field and AI, addressing the rapidly increasing demand for AI skills in the job market, which has surged by 619% over the past decade. Despite a recent Pew Research Center survey indicating that 53% of U.S. adults believe AI will diminish creative thinking, OSU faculty aim for students to effectively utilize AI for brainstorming and organization without supplanting critical thought. This forward-thinking curriculum is designed to provide students with a significant competitive advantage in the evolving global workforce.</p>
