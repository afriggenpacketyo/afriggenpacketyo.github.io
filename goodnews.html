          <p>In a recently detailed speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the robust and timely implementation of policies designed to support the country's private sector. He stressed that there should be no delay or compromise in carrying out measures decided by the party's Central Committee. Xi vowed to guarantee a level playing field for private firms, protect the lawful rights of entrepreneurs, and address long-standing challenges such as overdue payments from government entities. This move signals Beijing's continued effort to bolster confidence and stimulate growth within the private economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, for high-stakes talks on the war in Ukraine. The location was chosen for its security capabilities and availability during a busy tourist season. The summit has historical resonance, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The meeting will begin with a one-on-one session between the two leaders, followed by discussions with their delegations, and is expected to conclude with a joint press conference.</p>

The 20-year-old southpaw, who has 10 knockouts in his 12 professional wins, is seen as a rising star in the division. A victory over a well-known and formidable opponent like Whyte, a former interim world champion, would be a significant step up for Itauma. This fight is being framed as his potential breakthrough moment, which could propel him into contention for a world title shot.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint party members to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," noting that parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK does not. He highlighted his party's performance in the last general election and recent local elections as justification for his request to address this imbalance. Downing Street responded that appointments follow established conventions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those struggling with sleep, particularly during hot summer nights, experts offer several evidence-based strategies to improve sleep quality. Regular daily exercise, even for 30 minutes, can increase sleep duration and help regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. It is also recommended to avoid caffeine at least eight hours before bedtime and to reduce screen time before sleep, as the light and stimulation can be disruptive. Additionally, calming techniques like the "4-7-8" breathing method can help reduce stress and make it easier to fall asleep.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down the Trump administration's guidance that threatened to strip federal funding from schools and universities with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it issued memos framing DEI initiatives as a form of illegal discrimination against white and Asian American students. Judge Stephanie Gallagher stated the policy initiated a "sea change" in regulation and caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech, ordering the department to scrap the guidance.</p>
