          <p>Stable Recovery, an addiction rehabilitation program at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky, offers individuals a unique path to sobriety through working with thoroughbred horses. The program, co-founded by two men in recovery, addresses both addiction and a labor shortage in the horse industry, providing free year-long residency, training, and paid work opportunities. Participants live, work, and heal on the farm, finding purpose and non-judgmental connection with the horses. This article highlights the program's success, with 22 out of 25 graduates remaining sober and employed in the horse industry, and its recent expansion to include a women's house.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant deal with Pfizer, where the pharmaceutical giant pledged to lower drug costs in the U.S. to match prices in other developed countries and participate in a new discount website, TrumpRx. This marks a breakthrough after years of failed attempts by Trump to curb drug prices, which are nearly three times higher in the U.S. than in comparable nations. While the immediate impact on patients is unclear, with initial discounts primarily for Medicaid users and out-of-pocket purchases on TrumpRx, the agreement signals a shift in the industry's united front. This article notes that the deal was motivated by Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs not manufactured in the U.S., potentially emboldening him to pursue similar agreements with other drugmakers.

          <p>This article explores the surprising and often controversial history of university rankings, tracing their origins from Edwin Embree's informal 1934 list to the ubiquitous U.S. News & World Report rankings today. Early attempts, like Kendric Babcock's 1911 classification, were suppressed due to public outcry and political intervention, revealing deep anxieties among institutions and the public. Over decades, as higher education became a mass-consumer good, the demand for such metrics grew, leading to the systematic and influential rankings we know. The article highlights how these lists, initially met with skepticism, have profoundly shaped public perception and institutional strategies, despite criticisms of their methodology and potential for manipulation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that China's economic narrative is incomplete without acknowledging the significant transformation spearheaded by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Far from stagnation, China is actively restructuring, propelled by business leaders primarily born in the 1960s, 70s, and early 80s, who are technically skilled and focused on innovation. These entrepreneurs, often from provinces with robust business cultures, effectively combine their experiences of past scarcity with contemporary market and technological opportunities. The article emphasizes their crucial role in enhancing China's global competitiveness and integration, painting a picture of a dynamic and evolving economic landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Lucumí, also known as Santería, as a rich Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, developed by enslaved Africans in Cuba as an act of resistance and survival. Practitioners, like Francisco Álvarez León, find grounding and connection through its emphasis on character, balance, and honoring nature and ancestors. Scholars, such as Aisha M. Beliso-De Jesús, are working to destigmatize the religion, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black beliefs and its resistance to white supremacy. The article clarifies that practices like animal sacrifice, though sensationalized, are prayerful and community-oriented, aimed at healing and protection rather than harm.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the FICO score, saw its shares rally over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to bypass credit bureaus for credit scores. The company will now license its scores directly to mortgage resellers, aiming to eliminate mark-ups and offer lenders a choice in distribution models. This article notes that the move is expected to improve FICO's economics while potentially disintermediating credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose shares fell significantly. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director, who previously criticized FICO's pricing, lauded the initiative as a "creative solution" to help consumers and encourage market competitiveness.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that congressional Democrats are employing more substantive, albeit less visible, resistance tactics against the Trump administration than their frustrated voters perceive. Despite public calls for more dramatic opposition, Democrats are using procedural powers like Senate filibusters, forced roll call votes, and extensive speaking times to delay Trump's agenda and slow legislative processes. The article highlights examples such as marathon speeches and "holds" on nominees, alongside the crucial role of legal challenges outside Congress, which have successfully blocked or delayed many administration moves. It suggests a disconnect between the public's desire for flashy resistance and the effective, under-the-radar strategies actually being deployed.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale worth $6.6 billion, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at an impressive $500 billion valuation. This transaction, involving major investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, solidifies OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. The article notes that the lower-than-authorized participation in the sale is viewed internally as a vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. This strategic move, common among high-profile startups, helps retain talent and reward employees without pursuing an immediate IPO, amidst intensifying competition for AI researchers.

          <p>The Vatican's Swiss Guard, the world's smallest army, has debuted a new non-ceremonial, formal uniform designed for events outside the Vatican, such as embassy parties.
