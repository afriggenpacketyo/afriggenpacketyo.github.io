          <p>Luxembourg is set to welcome a new head of state as Grand Duke Henri, 70, formally abdicates after a 25-year reign, passing the title to his son, Guillaume. The 43-year-old heir will be crowned in a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace, attended by European royals and dignitaries, including the presidents of Germany and France. While the role is largely ceremonial, the transition marks a generational shift for the world's last grand duchy. The new Grand Duke, educated in Switzerland, the UK, and France, is expected to maintain continuity while potentially bringing a warmer approach to the position.</p>

          <p>An analytical article examines the contemporary relevance of the Nobel Prizes, first awarded in 1901. It acknowledges their role in popularizing major scientific achievements, such as mRNA vaccines and gene-editing technologies, and capturing the public's imagination. However, the article also delves into significant criticisms, including the perpetuation of the "genius scientist" myth, which overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. Furthermore, it highlights the prize's historical lack of diversity, with a persistent bias towards male laureates from institutions in Europe and the United States.</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released a major update to its 2019 report, advocating for a "planetary health diet" rich in plants and with significantly less meat and dairy to combat climate change and improve health. The report highlights that food systems contribute to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the release is shadowed by findings from the Changing Markets Foundation, which uncovered a "targeted and coordinated campaign" by industry-friendly figures to discredit the original report. This effort used social media to portray the scientific findings as dangerous and elitist, a challenge the commission anticipates facing again.</p>

          <p>China has finished assembling the world's largest single-unit floating offshore wind power system, a 16-megawatt turbine, in a significant step for its clean energy ambitions. The massive structure, whose rotor spans an area equivalent to seven soccer fields, was built with key components produced domestically, showcasing the nation's growing technological self-sufficiency. Once operational, the turbine is projected to generate enough electricity to power over 4,000 American homes annually. The system will now be towed to a deep-water location for installation and testing before being connected to the power grid for commercial use.</p>

          <p>India and China are set to resume direct flights by late October, ending a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued amid prolonged border tensions. The Indian embassy in China announced the move as part of a gradual normalization of relations between the two nations. Following the announcement, India's largest airline, IndiGo, confirmed it would restart its route from Kolkata to Guangzhou. This development comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China last month, which was aimed at thawing diplomatic relations that had frozen after a deadly border clash in 2020.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney has asserted that the quality of modern football defenders does not compare to that of the players he faced during his career. Speaking on his BBC podcast, the 39-year-old stated that today's centre-backs are "nowhere near as good" as his past opponents. While he praised Arsenal's William Saliba and Gabriel as the best current pairing in the Premier League for their leadership and communication, he maintained they would not be at the same level as past greats. Rooney also shared his personal ranking of the top five defenders he ever played against in the Champions League.</p>

          <p>The $55 billion acquisition of video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) by a Saudi-led consortium is being hailed as a win for investors but creates uncertainty for the gaming community. Analysts are optimistic about the deal's value for shareholders but are divided on its impact on game quality. For years, gamers have criticized EA for a lack of innovation and aggressive monetization tactics like loot boxes. Some analysts believe going private could free EA to take more creative risks, while others predict the company will double down on its profitable but unpopular live-service models to service the $20 billion in debt incurred by the deal.</p>

          <p>A new generation of defense technology startups, dubbed "neoprimes," is emerging from Silicon Valley to challenge legacy contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Companies such as Anduril Industries, SpaceX, and Palantir are attracting billions in venture funding by developing agile, software-first solutions for modern warfare, including AI, autonomy, and space technology. Venture funding for this sector reached approximately $38 billion in the first half of 2025 alone. These startups are focused on creating dual-use technologies that serve both commercial and military purposes, aiming to deter conflict by building a more advanced and credible national security apparatus.
