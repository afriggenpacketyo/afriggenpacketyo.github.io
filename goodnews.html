The incident occurred when local residents reported a man with a weapon, leading police to respond.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are conducting a promising clinical trial targeting breast cancer "sleeper cells" to prevent recurrence. These cells can break away from primary tumors and cause cancer to spread later. In a trial of 51 women, only two experienced cancer recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. This breakthrough offers hope for identifying and eliminating lurking cancer cells before they become incurable.</p>

          <p>NHS health checks in England, offered to adults aged 40-74 every five years, will officially incorporate menopause screening from 2026. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatments like HRT. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes this will bring menopause into the mainstream, reducing suffering in silence. Campaigners welcome the move to reduce stigma but warn about low uptake of health checks in some communities, emphasizing the need for staff training and broader access.</p>

Diagnosed two weeks after a difficult birth, Ledwick felt isolated and received unhelpful initial advice. She has since launched a podcast and written a book to break the silence, provide knowledge, and offer comfort to others. Medical experts emphasize that pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help, with treatment options available.</p>
