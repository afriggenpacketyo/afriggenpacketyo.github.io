          <p>An increasing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on content creators and viral skits rather than traditional media outlets. The article explores this trend through figures like Aaron Parnas, who has amassed millions of followers by quickly summarizing current events for a generation with a shorter attention span. This shift raises questions about the nature of news consumption, the potential for misinformation on the platform, and how established media can adapt to a landscape where speed and entertainment often trump in-depth reporting.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that the operations appeared to be unconstitutionally based on race and ethnicity. The Ninth Circuit ruling prohibits federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like their appearance, speaking Spanish, or their location. This decision addresses controversial raids by the Trump administration that have caused widespread fear within the region's Latino community and sparked significant protests.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than California for the first time. This growth is primarily driven by utility companies like Florida Power & Light, which are building solar farms because they are now more cost-effective than natural gas. The boom is occurring despite the state's official downplaying of climate change, though upcoming changes to federal tax credits could potentially slow future development.</p>
