          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the event, which caused brief shaking and confusion but resulted in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. Residents described the tremor as feeling like a loud boom or an impact against their homes. This minor quake follows a more notable 4.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same region in April 2024, though officials emphasized that the latest tremor was not a cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least four centuries, sending an ash cloud thousands of feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, leading seismologists to speculate the quake may have triggered the volcanic activity. While an aviation alert was issued, the sparsely populated area is not under immediate threat. Experts suggest that while the earthquake alone may not have caused the eruption, its seismic waves could have been the final catalyst for a volcano that was already close to erupting.</p>

This potential acquisition follows CommScope's previously reported exploration of a sale for this unit, which is its largest by sales and operating income. The move marks another significant transaction between the two companies, after Amphenol acquired CommScope's outdoor wireless network businesses in a separate deal last year.

The 33-year-old, who is also an Olympic cross-country champion, finished the final stage with a significant lead over her closest competitors. Ferrand-Prévot had shifted her focus from mountain biking back to road racing this season specifically to compete in the Tour. She called the victory a "dream come true," fulfilling a childhood ambition to race in the Tour de France that is now possible for women.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. This growth is fueled by favorable economics, as solar has become cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for smaller projects. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits under the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which is expected to decrease rooftop solar installations. Despite the lack of climate-focused state policy, the practical cost benefits are ensuring solar's expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Test match between England and India is set for a tense conclusion, with England needing just 35 more runs to win and India needing four wickets. After being in a precarious position, England was brought back into contention by centuries from Joe Root and Harry Brook. However, a late surge from India's bowlers, combined with the dismissals of both Root and Brook, left the match on a knife's edge before bad light stopped play. The outcome of the final morning will determine the series winner, with England chasing a historic run total on their home ground.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization and dismantling of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, running in local, state, and federal races, are openly criticizing the administration's policies and the purge of career staff from their former posts. Citing concerns over the erosion of anti-corruption efforts and civil rights enforcement, they are leveraging their public service backgrounds to campaign on a platform of restoring the rule of law, a notable shift for typically non-partisan career prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' series victory in Australia, Ireland centre Bundee Aki shared a remarkable personal story. He revealed that his wife, Kayla, had given birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car while on the way to the hospital in New Zealand. The birth happened just before the first Test match of the tour, and Aki learned the news via a video call shortly before a team meeting. The 35-year-old player, who had not yet met his newborn, praised his wife as a "powerful, strong woman" after sharing the unique and happy family news.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance, with payouts likely to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, did deem excessively high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on a scheme to address these unfair cases, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator advises affected customers to complain directly to their lender. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to once again include information about President Trump's two impeachments. The statement followed a report that a placard detailing the impeachments had been removed from "The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the temporary placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present "accurate and complete histories."</p>

          <p>Canada's Trade Minister, Dominic LeBlanc, stated that his government was "disappointed" by the U.S. decision to impose a 35% tariff on certain Canadian goods but remains committed to negotiations. LeBlanc characterized recent talks with U.S. officials as constructive, even though they did not result in a deal to avert the new duties. The Trump administration justified the tariffs by citing a lack of progress on immigration and fentanyl flows, a claim Canada disputes. LeBlanc emphasized the shared economic interests between the two nations and expressed a willingness to find a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>
