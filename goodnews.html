        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of Greene King, a major UK pub and brewing company, has identified cafes and food delivery apps as significant new competitors for consumer leisure time and spending. CEO Nick Mackenzie stated that as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, reduces alcohol consumption, pubs must adapt to stay relevant. The industry is shifting towards offering better food, credible coffee options, and creating more comfortable environments to attract a wider clientele. This evolution reflects a broader trend in hospitality where traditional pubs are evolving to compete with the convenience of delivery services and the social appeal of coffee shops.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish a direct export channel for its fresh durians to China, aiming to significantly increase profits by bypassing intermediary countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring nations assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain storage required by Chinese authorities. By developing its own certification processes and improving logistics, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the massive Chinese durian market, which consumes over 90% of the world's supply. This strategic move is intended to enhance the economic returns for Indonesian growers and strengthen the country's position in the global agricultural trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's primary stock index, the KOSPI, achieved a new record high for the third day in a row, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive performance occurred even as other major Asia-Pacific markets, such as Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225, experienced significant losses. The downturn in the broader region was influenced by concerns over the U.S. banking sector and renewed trade tensions. The resilience of the South Korean market highlights investor confidence in the country's specific economic outlook despite wider regional instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Francesco Camarda, a 17-year-old forward from AC Milan, is being hailed as a prodigious talent and a potential future star for Italy's national team. He has already broken several records, including becoming the youngest player to debut in Serie A and the youngest Italian to score for the under-21 national team. Known for his composure, strength, and clinical finishing inside the penalty box, Camarda has been carefully developed by his boyhood club, which recently secured him with a long-term contract. Despite the immense expectations, he maintains a focused and grounded attitude, letting his performance on the field speak for itself.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism about Marcus Rashford's recent comments attributing his inconsistent form to the club's environment. Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona, stated he had been in an "inconsistent environment for a very long time." Rooney countered this by suggesting that personal application is key and that blaming the environment can be an easy excuse for poor performance. He emphasized that a player's effort on the field, such as running more, is not determined by the environment but by individual accountability.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are set to call for accelerated action on utilizing frozen Russian assets to provide financial support for Ukraine, according to a draft document. The push comes amid growing pressure from the U.S. to seize these assets to help cover Ukraine's military and defense needs for 2026-2027. The European Commission is exploring how to use approximately €175 billion in cash from matured Russian assets held in Europe. However, some member states, particularly Belgium, have expressed concerns about the potential legal and financial repercussions, stressing the need for fair burden-sharing with G7 partners.</p>
