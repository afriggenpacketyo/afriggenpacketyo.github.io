The stories aim to provide comfort and understanding to children dealing with grief, blended families, and being re-homed. Sarah's latest book, released in March 2025, is titled "A Time for Truth: My Father Jason and My Search for Justice and Healing."</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The government says this move represents a "new dawn for rail," with plans to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. While lower fares were not promised, the government assured passengers of great value for money and expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies. The SWR trains will now be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure and sport the new GBR livery.</p>

          <p>Despite securing significant trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent YouGov poll indicates that 69% of British voters have an unfavorable view of Starmer, with a notable decline among Labour voters. While businesses acknowledge the positive direction of trade policies, cost-of-living pressures and tax increases continue to concern voters.

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters Sunday for the first time since elbow surgery in September 2023. Roberts said that the natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes it unlikely that Ohtani will pitch before the break. The Dodgers initially considered having him return to the mound early in the season, but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training.</p>

          <p>A new study finds that stress from work can affect dogs at home. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners and measured job stress and rumination, then tracked dog stress behaviors. The study found that owners with higher job stress had dogs who showed more stress-related behaviors. The big factor driving the connection was rumination, as owners who mentally took work home were more likely to have stressed-out dogs. Putting work aside when you walk through the door doesn‚Äôt just help your own health, it helps your dog, too.</p>
