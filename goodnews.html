          <p>Shares for Trilogy Metals, a Canadian minerals exploration company, experienced a premarket surge of nearly 200% following a White House announcement of a strategic partnership. The U.S. government will invest $35.6 million to acquire a 10% stake in the company, aiming to develop critical mineral resources like copper and cobalt in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move, which reverses a previous administration's decision to block the project, is part of a broader effort to secure domestic supply chains for materials essential to energy, defense, and manufacturing. The project remains controversial, with opponents citing potential harm to local wildlife and communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current government shutdown offers the Trump administration a prime opportunity to enact significant cuts to the federal workforce and government spending. The author contends that federal bureaucracy is bloated and wasteful, citing public surveys that suggest widespread belief in government inefficiency. The piece highlights the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in eliminating wasteful contracts and suggests that the shutdown could be used as leverage to permanently downsize agencies. The author frames this potential reduction as a necessary step towards restoring fiscal sanity and fulfilling a mandate from taxpayers to shrink the government.</p>

          <p>A couple in New Orleans made a remarkable archaeological find while clearing their yard, unearthing a marble grave marker dating back to the second-century Roman Empire. After contacting university experts, the headstone was identified as belonging to a Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus and was matched to an artifact reported missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy. Researchers believe the stone was likely brought to the U.S. sometime after World War II, when the Italian museum was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. The relic has been turned over to the FBI's art crime team for repatriation, bringing a nearly 2,000-year-old object one step closer to its home.</p>

The investigation began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow, where police discovered a shipment of nearly 900 phones. Subsequent raids led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. Police believe the gang was responsible for a significant portion of all phones stolen in London, where thieves were paid up to £300 per handset, with the devices later sold for thousands in China.</p>

          <p>UNESCO's executive board has nominated Khaled el-Anani, an Egyptian Egyptologist and the country's former minister of antiquities and tourism, to be the next director-general of the agency. If confirmed, el-Anani will be the first person from the Arab world to lead the UN's cultural and scientific organization. His nomination comes at a challenging time for UNESCO, which is facing significant budget shortfalls following the withdrawal of the United States under the Trump administration. El-Anani has stated that addressing the budget crisis and seeking to regain the U.S. as a member will be his top priorities.</p>

          <p>In a significant technological advancement, China has launched the first commercial underwater data center in the world, located off the coast of Hainan province. The facility consists of large, 1,300-tonne cabins submerged 35 meters deep, which house server racks for managing digital services. This innovative design leverages the natural cooling properties of seawater, which is expected to drastically reduce the energy consumption typically required for cooling land-based data centers. The project is a key component of Hainan's plan to develop its blue economy and pioneer new marine technologies, ultimately aiming to deploy 100 such data cabins.</p>

          <p>Nigeria international Ashleigh Plumptre has opened up about her decision to move from the English Women's Super League to play for Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia. The defender admits her initial reaction was to decline the offer but was convinced by the project after a visit. She acknowledges the move was controversial and that she "deeply hurt" some LGBTQ+ fans, but she does not condone all aspects of the country's laws. Plumptre also shares her personal experience of feeling safer as a woman in Jeddah than in the UK, while recognizing that the Saudi women's league still has a long way to go in terms of on-field standards and fan attendance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has raised its economic growth forecast for China in 2025 from 4% to 4.8%, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. The upgrade is attributed to the positive impact of government stimulus measures and resilient export growth, which have helped offset the country's ongoing real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending. However, the report cautions that this momentum may not be sustainable, projecting a slowdown to 4.2% growth in 2026 as stimulus effects fade and global trade tensions persist. The bank also noted challenges from high youth unemployment and an aging population. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese automotive giant BYD has seen its UK car sales skyrocket by 880% in September compared to the previous year, establishing the country as its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars last month, with its Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV leading the charge. This success is partly attributed to the UK's lack of import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, unlike the significant levies imposed by the EU and the US. As BYD expands its retail presence in Britain, its affordable models are rapidly gaining market share in a country experiencing record-high demand for electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
