          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:44:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing, U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China increased by 660% in June. These critical components are essential for high-tech manufacturing, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, a sector where China holds an estimated 90% market share. The surge highlights America's dependency on Chinese supplies and the significant impact of trade policies on critical industries, even as the U.S. explores domestic alternatives like recycling. The easing of restrictions has provided relief to companies that faced production disruptions due to previous shortages.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since its privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. The 88 proposals aim to address systemic issues like underinvestment, leaking infrastructure, and persistent sewage spills that have drawn widespread public criticism. The review suggests a new regulatory focus on continuous infrastructure investment, similar to the telecoms sector, to prevent future crises. While these changes will take time, they signal a governmental push to rectify past failures, though higher consumer bills appear inevitable to fund the necessary upgrades.</p>

          <p>The British government has officially confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what was later described as discredited evidence. Campaigners who have sought justice for decades expressed cautious elation at the news. The inquiry aims to provide answers and accountability for an event that remains a painful chapter in British industrial history.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), driving the total assets under management in this category to over US$50 billion. This surge in popularity is fueled by a desire for lower-risk, fixed-income assets in an economic environment marked by persistent deflation and weak consumption. These ETFs offer diversification, lower costs, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments, with funds targeting corporate notes seeing particularly rapid growth. The trend reflects investor hedging against an uncertain economic outlook and unresolved trade tensions with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, thanks to the completion of critical railway and port infrastructure projects led by Chinese companies. For years, logistical bottlenecks have prevented the export of resources from significant deposits like Guinea's Simandou mine and Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine. The new transport links will connect these remote, resource-rich areas to seaports, facilitating large-scale shipments. This development marks a significant step in securing raw material supply chains for China while boosting the economies of the African nations involved.</p>

The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into developing advanced AI chips, data centers, cloud computing, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. This strategic pivot was largely necessitated by U.S. sanctions, which inadvertently spurred Huawei to become a state-backed national champion in China's tech race. The company is now a "jack of all trades" in AI, competing in nearly every complex sector of the industry.</p>

Women with PCOS report that the drugs have helped alleviate a wide range of symptoms, including irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain, by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing testosterone levels. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, health experts see massive potential in GLP-1s, though larger clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and address issues like insurance coverage.</p>
