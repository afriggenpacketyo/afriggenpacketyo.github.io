          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are set to open higher, tracking Wall Street's recent gains, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential easing of monetary policy next month. Powell's address at Jackson Hole indicated increasing concern over job market deceleration, leading to expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts. This positive outlook has influenced global markets, with futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng pointing to stronger opens. However, U.S. equity futures remain largely unchanged in early Asian hours as investors await artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's earnings, reflecting a mix of optimism and anticipation.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' slumping offense dramatically rebounded in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, successfully avoiding a series sweep and reclaiming a tie for first place in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts had challenged his team to display more competitive at-bats and a renewed team-first mindset at the plate. Dalton Rushing delivered a crucial go-ahead three-run home run in the seventh inning, complemented by Freddie Freeman's two long balls, including one in the decisive rally. This nine-hit, four-walk outburst showcased improved discipline and slugging prowess, turning around two previously anemic offensive displays and significantly boosting team morale.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, has been the site of over 70 medical miracles recognized by the Catholic Church in the past 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates thousands of cure claims over decades, seeking instantaneous, complete, and lasting recoveries without medical explanation. Despite skepticism about historical rigor, a 2014 study found the office's conclusions credible. The article highlights cases of individuals, like Vittorio Micheli and Sister Bernadette Moriau, whose recoveries from severe diseases were officially recognized as miraculous, demonstrating the enduring mystery and faith surrounding the site.</p>

          <p>Anduril Industries, co-founded by Palmer Luckey, unveiled "Fury," an autonomous AI-powered fighter jet designed to operate without a pilot, marking a significant leap in combat technology. CEO Brian Schimpf highlighted Fury's ability to sense, understand, and react to airspace conditions, working collaboratively with manned aircraft to protect human pilots. This development represents a pivotal shift in warfare, aiming to reduce risks to human lives by deploying unmanned systems in dangerous combat environments. The Air Force has awarded contracts to Anduril and General Atomics to develop and test these collaborative combat aircraft, with Fury's first test flight scheduled for this summer, aiming for full operational status by the end of this decade.</p>

          <p>Corpus Christi city officials are considering reinstituting a street maintenance fee, previously eliminated in 2024, to fund residential street repairs and address a projected $15 million shortfall by fiscal year 2027. The proposed fee would increase from $5.30 to $6.60 per month, generating about $15 million over nine months. While some council members now support its return, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and Councilman Gil Hernandez advocate for alternative funding, such as bond programs or adjusting the general fund's reserve balance, to avoid burdening residents with additional utility bill increases. The debate highlights challenges in securing recurring funding for essential infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics on Sunday, establishing a new single-season record for catchers and surpassing Salvador Perez’s 2021 total. The switch-hitting Raleigh also achieved his ninth multi-home run game of the season, breaking Mickey Mantle’s record for most multi-home run games by a switch-hitter in a major league season. This first-time All-Star, at 28, has demonstrated remarkable power, with 40 homers while primarily catching and nine as a designated hitter. Raleigh, who recently won the All-Star Home Run Derby, is on pace to become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs, cementing a stellar season.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently moving north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean.

This development follows Hurricane Erin, which earlier became a ferocious Category 5 storm without making landfall. NOAA predicts an above-normal hurricane season this year, with an anticipated 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which are expected to become hurricanes.</p>
