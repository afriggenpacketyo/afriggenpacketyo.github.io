        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiff is proposing a new parking permit system that would charge owners of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and other large, high-polluting vehicles a premium. This initiative aims to reduce congestion and improve air quality by incentivizing residents to use public transport, walk, or cycle, potentially making Cardiff the first UK city to implement such a policy. The plan also includes eliminating city center residential permits and creating new ones for essential workers like carers and NHS staff. While some residents support the environmental goals, others express concern that it unfairly penalizes tradespeople and those reliant on larger vehicles for work, highlighting a division in public opinion on the proposed changes.</p>

This new deal will mark Anderson's 25th year in professional cricket, having debuted for Lancashire in 2001.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a remarkable 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit year-over-year, surpassing estimates and setting a new record, primarily fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company's revenue also climbed 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion. CEO C.C. Wei noted strengthening conviction in the "AI mega trend," leading to an increased 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and a higher capital expenditure floor for capacity expansion. Growth in advanced 3nm and 4/5nm chips, crucial for AI GPUs and premium smartphones, significantly contributed to these gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Melissa Tran, a Maryland mother of five and Vietnamese refugee, has been released from ICE detention after more than five months, following a federal judge's order. Her detention stemmed from a non-violent theft conviction from two decades ago when she was a teenager. Despite a 2003 removal order, Vietnam wouldn't accept her, allowing her to stay with regular immigration check-ins until her recent detainment. Tran described unsanitary conditions during her transfer through multiple facilities. While reunited with her children, she still faces potential deportation, possibly to a third country, as her lawyers hope to reopen her immigration case and highlight her stable life and family in the US.</p>

          <h2>United Airlines Forecasts Stronger Q4 Earnings Despite Q3 Revenue Miss</h2>

          <p>United Airlines projected higher-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, forecasting $3 to $3.50 per share, exceeding analyst estimates. This optimistic outlook follows a mixed third-quarter performance where the airline beat earnings expectations with $2.78 per share, but its revenue of $15.23 billion fell slightly short of estimates. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the airline's resilience to long-term investments in its network, technology, and customer service, which have fostered brand loyalty. United continues to expand its flying capacity and global network, with premium-cabin revenue rising 6% in Q3, demonstrating its strategy to attract affluent travelers despite broader industry challenges and economic volatility.

          <h2>Most Heirs Do Not Retain Parents' Wealth Advisors, Survey Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 07:55:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Cerulli Associates reveals that only 27% of heirs plan to keep their benefactors' wealth advisors, with this figure dropping to 20% for those who have already inherited. The primary reasons for switching are that heirs already have their own advisors or lack a relationship with their parents' advisor, rather than a desire for self-directed investing. Interestingly, most wealthy benefactors are ambivalent about whether their heirs continue with the same advisor. The core issue lies in clients' reluctance to discuss estate plans with their families, limiting opportunities for advisors to build relationships with the next generation. Advisors are urged to encourage these crucial intergenerational conversations to ensure continuity and ease the transition for survivors. (not investment advice)</p>

He reiterated calls to use frozen Russian assets to fund weapons for Ukraine, despite some European resistance, and stressed the need for less regulation and more competitiveness within the EU to foster innovation and environmental protection.</p>

          <h2>Guide Dogs Charity Welcomes Largest Litter in Three Years: 13 Puppies</h2>

          <p>A guide dog charity in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has welcomed its largest litter in three years—13 puppies affectionately dubbed "the baker's dozen." The puppies, seven boys and six girls, have been given bakery-themed names like Biscuit, Crumble, and Apple. Staff were surprised by the size of the litter from mum Yori, as counting puppies during pregnancy can be tricky. This significant addition highlights the charity's role as the world's largest breeding program for assistance dogs. These puppies will now be allocated to dedicated volunteer puppy raisers across the UK, who will help train them to become life-changing guide dogs by 2027.</p>

          <p>Kanchha Sherpa, the last surviving member of the historic 1953 expedition that first successfully scaled Mount Everest, has died in Kathmandu at the age of 92. Sherpa was just 19 when he joined the 35-member team led by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as a porter. Despite lacking prior mountaineering experience, he played a crucial role, carrying supplies up to base camp, and was one of only three Sherpas to ascend past 8,000 meters. His passing marks the end of an era for those directly involved in one of humanity's greatest exploratory achievements, leaving behind a legacy of endurance and contribution to mountaineering history.</p>
