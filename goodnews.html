          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy 85-page filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. However, the court has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professionally structured amended complaint, limited to 40 pages. Trump responded to the dismissal by asserting, "I'm winning, I'm winning the cases," during an Oval Office event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, although a final agreement has not yet been reached. The discussions are centered on a framework to address U.S. national security concerns, which stem from a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American operations. Trump, who has previously extended the deadline for the divestiture multiple times, expressed optimism that a deal is "well on its way" and just needs to be formally signed.</p>

          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner has publicly supported Jimmy Kimmel following the indefinite suspension of his show by ABC, a Disney subsidiary. Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he termed "out-of-control intimidation," suggesting the network caved to political pressure after Carr threatened action over Kimmel's comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. In his statement, Eisner defended Kimmel as talented and funny and questioned the leadership of corporations that fail to stand up for First Amendment principles against government bullying. He framed the incident as a concerning example of suppressing speech for political self-interest.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his bitcoin holdings on the platform after being locked out for years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, highlighting the challenges with Coinbase's account recovery process. Durant, an early investor in both bitcoin and Coinbase itself, first purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was significantly lower. The incident has amplified a broader conversation about the cryptocurrency exchange's customer service and support infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Journalist Lexis-Olivier Ray of the website L.A. Taco has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, alleging officers repeatedly violated his First Amendment rights. The suit claims that police and city sanitation workers wrongfully threatened him with arrest and, on one occasion, handcuffed him while he was documenting sweeps of homeless encampments. This legal action adds to growing scrutiny of the LAPD's treatment of the press, following other recent lawsuits and a court order barring the use of less-lethal weapons on journalists during protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr violated the First Amendment by threatening ABC with regulatory action if it did not discipline Jimmy Kimmel. The article cites Supreme Court precedents, including NRA v. Vullo, which establish that government officials cannot use coercion to punish or suppress disfavored speech. By threatening ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's political commentary, Carr engaged in unconstitutional pressure, which is part of a broader pattern by the Trump administration to intimidate the media. The piece concludes that ABC had the right to suspend Kimmel, but the FCC's threat crossed a clear legal line.</p>

While the Fed's cut lowered short-term rates, the increase in long-term yields suggests that concerns about the broader economic outlook and government finances are weighing on the bond market.
