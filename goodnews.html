        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White addressed the intense physical challenges rookie Caitlin Clark has faced this season. Following a game where Clark sustained an apparent groin injury, White commented on the unique level of physicality opponents are permitted to use against her, suggesting the team must find ways to help her adjust. Clark, who was seen in tears on the sideline, is now listed as questionable for the upcoming game against the New York Liberty. White acknowledged that the entire WNBA has seen a rise in physical play, but noted the specific nature of the defensive pressure on Clark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 62, guiding the tourists to victory with 10 balls remaining. Despite a late rally from England that created a tense finish, India achieved its second-highest successful run chase in the format. England's performance was hampered by a slow start and sloppy fielding, though Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 provided some positives for the home team in the crucial series ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will use Google's cloud infrastructure to support its popular ChatGPT AI assistant, diversifying its computing resources beyond its initial exclusive reliance on Microsoft. This move addresses the heavy demand for OpenAI's services and the need for additional computing power, which CEO Sam Altman has previously highlighted as a capacity constraint. The partnership is a significant win for Google's cloud division, which also services AI competitor Anthropic. OpenAI will now leverage a multi-cloud strategy, using platforms from Google, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and Oracle to power its AI models and APIs globally.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his adept navigation of U.S.-China trade tensions, culminating in Washington's approval for Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang's strategy involved consistently arguing that excluding Nvidia from China would undermine U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with the Trump administration. Analysts praise his ability to cultivate relationships in both Washington and Beijing, turning a potential geopolitical crisis into a diplomatic victory for the company. This success has reinforced his status as a highly effective leader, further bolstering investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

While RFK Jr. has the authority to enact nationwide bans, he has so far focused on pressuring companies for voluntary changes, a strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles. This state-led approach may create de facto national standards, as companies might alter products to comply with the strictest state laws.</p>

Recent cases include South Africa's suit against Israel and Ukraine's against Russia.

The 35-year-old actor, known for her role as Hermione Granger, was also ordered to pay over $1,400 in fines and court costs. The suspension was triggered by her fourth speeding ticket in less than a year, which brought her total penalty points to the automatic suspension threshold.

          <p>The Canadian government has announced new restrictions on tariff-free steel imports to protect its domestic industry from the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada will tighten its tariff rate quotas, imposing a 50% tariff on steel imports from non-US countries that exceed 50% of 2024 volumes. The measures also specifically target steel melted and poured in China with an additional tariff, reflecting a broader strategy to reduce dependency on foreign steel. The government also pledged to prioritize Canadian steel in federal projects, aiming to bolster domestic production which has fallen significantly since the U.S. levies began.</p>

          <p>As U.S. inflation continues to rise, consumers with credit card debt may face higher interest rates, as the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its high-rate policy to control prices. Most credit cards have variable rates tied to the Fed's benchmark, meaning sustained inflation could keep borrowing costs elevated or push them higher. With the average credit card rate already exceeding 21%, any further increases would make it more difficult for individuals to pay down their balances. The article suggests several strategies for consumers to lower their costs, including negotiating with issuers, using balance transfer cards, or considering debt consolidation.

The proposed legislation would cap contributions, prohibit donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and require public disclosure to prevent libraries from being used as a tool for corruption or to curry favor with a sitting president.
