        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article humorously addresses the British cultural obsession with weather, offering an interactive platform for readers to compare their local forecasts against cities across the globe. It playfully challenges the common perception that other places are always "cooler" or "sunnier," encouraging a fresh perspective on the UK's own climate. The piece aims to provide comprehensive, yet non-redundant, coverage of a universal topic through an engaging, comparative lens. By inviting personal exploration of meteorological data, it fosters a deeper, more informed appreciation for diverse weather patterns and their societal impact, moving beyond simple complaints to a broader understanding.</p>

          <p>A time capsule, buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1991, has been opened, offering a fascinating glimpse into the 1990s. Among its contents were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, and a pocket TV, selected by children who won a Blue Peter competition with Princess Diana's involvement. Though meant for centuries later, its early retrieval facilitates the construction of a new children's cancer center. This article provides a poignant connection to the late Princess and marks a significant moment for the hospital, blending historical curiosity with forward-looking medical advancements.

          <p>A SAP Concur report reveals a significant divergence in U.S. travel trends for the first half of 2025: leisure travel has declined, yet business travel to the country has increased, making the U.S. the top global destination for corporate visitors. This article highlights that 15% of all business air travel bookings were to the U.S., double that of Germany and the UK. Despite global economic headwinds and political tensions, the stability in business travel indicates that corporate interests continue to prioritize engagement with the United States, showcasing a resilient sector amidst fluctuating international travel sentiments.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced rate of decline in July, contracting by 1.5% year-on-year, marking the slowest fall in months. This article highlights that the manufacturing sector, in particular, experienced a 6.8% profit growth, with raw materials, steelmakers, and petroleum refiners shifting from losses to profits. Statistician Yu Weining attributed this improvement to policy measures aimed at promoting a reasonable rebound in prices and curbing overcapacity, which have begun to ease the strain from intense competition. Despite this, profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflationary factory-gate prices.</p>

          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has made history by becoming Netflix's most-viewed film, surpassing 236 million watches since its June release.
