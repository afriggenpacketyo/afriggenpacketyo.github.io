Kennedy Jr., writing in a Fox News opinion piece, asserts that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than citizens of other wealthy nations, with pharmaceutical companies deriving a disproportionate amount of their profits from the United States. He highlights President Trump's executive order aimed at ensuring Americans pay no more for medications than other developed countries. Kennedy claims to have engaged with pharmaceutical CEOs, emphasizing the administration's commitment to affordable access to therapies and its willingness to use statutory authority to address the imbalance.

          <p>CNBC provides guidance for student loan borrowers on avoiding delinquency and default as the Trump administration increases collection efforts. The article explains the difference between delinquency (missing a payment) and default (failing to make payments for 270 days), emphasizing that only borrowers in default face garnishments of tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. Experts recommend that delinquent borrowers contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in income-driven repayment plans, while those in default can pursue loan rehabilitation or enroll in an income-driven repayment plan. The article highlights the importance of proactive communication and awareness of available options to manage student loan debt.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that Hollywood is struggling to maintain its dominance in the film and TV production industry due to increasing global competition and financial incentives offered by other countries and states. Production has not rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 strikes, leading to intensified competition for fewer projects. President Trump briefly considered imposing tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. but has since paused to meet with industry leaders. The article highlights efforts by states like New York and New Jersey to attract productions through tax credits and infrastructure investments, as well as the need for California to update its own incentive programs to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Vox reports on a unanimous Supreme Court decision in Barnes v. Felix, rebuking the Fifth Circuit's narrow approach to police violence cases. The Court held that the Fifth Circuit erred by focusing solely on the moment of the threat in excessive force cases, rather than considering the totality of the circumstances leading up to the use of force. Justice Kagan emphasized that prior events can provide crucial context for understanding an officer's actions. The article notes that the ruling does not guarantee a different outcome in the case but clarifies the proper legal standard for evaluating excessive force claims.</p>

While the White House has engaged with various stakeholders, including fertility doctors and conservative policy groups, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been included in the process. The administration's efforts are complicated by differing views within the Republican base, with some Christian conservatives opposing IVF due to concerns about embryo loss.
