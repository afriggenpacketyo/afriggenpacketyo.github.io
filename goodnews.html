          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station, carrying a four-person international crew. The mission, commanded by NASA's Zena Cardman, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center after a one-day weather delay. The crew includes NASA pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. This flight is particularly significant for Cardman, who was reassigned from a previous mission to accommodate the return of astronauts from Boeing's troubled Starliner test flight. The crew will spend about six months aboard the station.</p>

The app analyzes a child's language patterns, tone, and online activity to detect anomalies that could signal stress or mood shifts, then provides reports to parents to facilitate dialogue. The creator was motivated by his own daughter's mental health struggles linked to social media use.

The affected products were distributed between July 1 and July 25, 2025, and are identified by a specific UPC code. No illnesses have been reported to date, but consumers are urged to discard the product and can receive a full refund from any Sam's Club location.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 revival of "The Naked Gun," directed by Akiva Schaffer, brings back the genre of pure farce, a style of comedy largely absent from modern cinema. The film stars Liam Neeson as Lieutenant Frank Drebin Jr., leveraging his established action-hero persona for comedic effect, much like the original films did with Leslie Nielsen. The review praises the movie for its commitment to a high joke-per-minute ratio and its refreshing, nonsensical energy. In an era dominated by serious blockbusters, this out-and-out spoof is celebrated as a welcome return to simple, theatrical fun.</p>

          <p>Following a significant drop in Amazon's stock price after its earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that this presents an "amazing buying opportunity." The market reacted negatively to mixed guidance and perceived weakness in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division, despite its 17.5% year-over-year growth. Cramer believes the market overreacted to comments from the CEO and that the fundamentals remain strong. He also commented on Apple, suggesting that while its quarter was excellent, the stock was held back by a lack of a clear AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool may withdraw from their attempt to sign striker Alexander Isak after Newcastle United rejected an opening bid of £110 million. Newcastle reportedly values the 25-year-old Swedish international at around £150 million and has maintained he is not for sale. Isak, who wants to explore a move, was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour with a minor injury and has been training separately. Liverpool, having already spent heavily this summer on other players, does not believe a deal for Isak is currently achievable at Newcastle's asking price, despite their strong interest.</p>

          <p>One hundred and fifty years after his death, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen remains one of the world's most beloved storytellers. Growing up in poverty, Andersen's talent for writing was eventually recognized, and his fairy tales like "The Little Mermaid" and "The Ugly Duckling" achieved global fame. His stories often contain subtle social criticism and explore timeless human emotions of longing, identity, and injustice, which contributes to their lasting relevance. Andersen's works have been translated into over 150 languages and continue to inspire countless adaptations, cementing his status as a cultural icon.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant change to its main civil service internship program, restricting eligibility exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This move aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall, where they are currently underrepresented. A person's background will be judged by their parents' occupation. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The policy has been welcomed by social mobility advocates but criticized by some Conservatives who argue it is social engineering.</p>

          <p>Utility workers installing a gas network in Lima, Peru, have discovered two pre-Incan tombs, one of which contained the 1,000-year-old remains of an individual. The person was found in a seated position and was buried with artifacts including clay vessels and pumpkin shells. Archaeologists have linked the style of the vessels to the Chancay culture, which existed from approximately 1000 to 1470 AD. This is not the first such discovery for the utility company, which has unearthed over 2,200 archaeological finds during its decades of excavation work in Lima.</p>

          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, annuities are an appealing option for securing retirement income, but making a smart decision requires understanding some fundamental guidelines. Financial experts suggest several rules, including keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least ten years for it to grow. It is also advised to first cover essential living expenses with guaranteed income sources before purchasing an annuity. Planners often recommend allocating no more than 25% of your total retirement portfolio to these illiquid products. (not investment advice)</p>
