          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed Tuesday's market activity, attributing stock movements to rising bond yields as Wall Street awaits congressional action on a federal budget bill. He noted that certain stocks, especially those tied to consumer spending and banks, are more vulnerable to bond market fluctuations. As an example, Home Depot's stock initially rose after reporting earnings but later declined due to concerns that higher bond yields could slow the housing market. Cramer highlighted GE Vernova as a company resilient to bond market changes, citing its potential to benefit from increasing energy demands and new projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked a school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT), citing concerns about the policy's vagueness and potential for limiting educational discussions. The Temecula Valley unified school district's ban, adopted in 2022, was challenged for its lack of clear definitions and guidance for teachers. The court found that the resolution created "confusion and fear" among educators, potentially hindering their ability to address sensitive topics like slavery. The decision underscores the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding CRT in education.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means that many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA is urging manufacturers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before seeking approval for all healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. The agency's new leadership cited concerns about the one-size-fits-all approach to vaccine approvals and the need for more evidence-based strategies.</p>

A big shout but he has been really good and scored a big goal in a must-win game for Forest at West Ham. Excellent.\n\nEzri Konsa (Aston Villa): It is not nice for me to talk about Aston Villa players in a really good way, but these guys are performing big at the moment. An excellent performance and he is growing more as a man and as a leader under Unai Emery. I can see him being a real threat for England in the World Cup - and starting.\n\nConnor Bradley (Liverpool): A lot of eyes on him. Not only with Trent leaving but what looks like Jeremie Frimpong joining. I think he has been fantastic and showcased how good he can be going forward with a lovely assist at Brighton. A career we will all watch with intrigue. It is up to Mr Frimpong to get him out.</p>
