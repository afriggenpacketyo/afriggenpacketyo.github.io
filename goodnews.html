          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, survivors and family of the deceased are grappling with the aftermath. The attack by gunman Thomas Crooks killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and severely injured David Dutch and James Copenhaver. While Comperatore's family still seeks answers regarding security lapses, the injured survivors are focusing on their physical and psychological recovery. Despite life-altering injuries, they express a renewed motivation to embrace life, spend time with family, and not dwell on the past, turning a traumatic event into a call for living more fully.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant talent acquisition, hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D employees. As part of the $2.4 billion agreement, Google will gain a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology but is not investing in the company itself. This move highlights the escalating 'talent war' in the artificial intelligence sector, with major companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft making substantial deals to secure top AI researchers and engineers. Windsurf will continue to operate under a new interim CEO, building its enterprise product.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing backlash over a design critics said resembled traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging their cultural origins, prompting criticism from Indian fashion figures and politicians. Following the outcry, Prada engaged in talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents the artisans. This move is seen as a positive step toward respectful collaboration between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to halt immigration raids in several Southern California counties. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong came in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were violating constitutional rights by engaging in racial profiling and conducting stops without reasonable suspicion. The judge stated that agents cannot rely solely on factors like apparent ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or presence at certain locations to initiate a stop. The decision represents a significant legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to create AI clones without proper consent, after they were hired for what they were told were internal or academic projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and improper use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The decision is considered a significant victory for artists seeking to protect their work from misuse by AI companies.</p>

          <p>Driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad, Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international footprint. As Chinese enterprises expand globally, they increasingly prefer legal support from domestic firms, citing greater trust and understanding. The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has grown by 70 percent since 2018, reflecting a strategic move to support national interests in a changing geopolitical landscape. While serving Chinese clients is the primary focus, lawyers say winning over non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amid rising global tensions.</p>

          <p>With the patent for the popular weight-loss and diabetes drug semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) expiring in China next year, dozens of Chinese firms are racing to enter the lucrative market. Currently, about 60 similar drugs are in clinical trials in China, aiming to provide more affordable alternatives to the expensive medication. Analysts predict that the entry of up to 20 generic competitors will drive down prices, making these treatments more accessible for patients with obesity and diabetes. This development could significantly reshape the global weight-loss drug market, which is estimated to be worth US$150 billion.</p>

Officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in global trade but express confidence in the port's long-term growth and its importance to the American supply chain.

          <p>A decade after its quiet release, Lord Huron's song "The Night We Met" has become an unlikely global sensation, accumulating over three billion plays on Spotify alone. Initially the final track on the band's 2015 album, its popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and subsequently becoming a viral sound on TikTok. The song's slow-burning success is unusual for a track that was not an initial hit, and it now out-streams many contemporary pop superstars. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes its enduring appeal to its relatable, wistful theme of reflecting on a past relationship.</p>

          <p>A fierce debate is underway in Prague over the fate of the historic Vysehrad railway bridge, a 123-year-old steel landmark. The national Railway Authority plans to dismantle the bridge, arguing it is corroded and can no longer handle growing rail traffic, and replace it with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists, backed by UNESCO and a public petition, insists the bridge can and should be repaired in place. They argue that demolishing the iconic structure is unnecessary and would destroy a crucial part of Prague's historic skyline.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically struggled on grass but has found her form, adjusting her tactics by playing further behind the baseline to utilize her powerful forehand. Anisimova, an unseeded former prodigy, plays an aggressive, high-risk game and may benefit from having nothing to lose as the underdog. The outcome will likely depend on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's free-swinging style.</p>

While affirming the importance of the US alliance and the AUKUS security pact, Albanese's government is signaling a determination to act in its own national interest.
