          <p>A recent American Heart Association survey found that nearly 90% of U.S. adults are unaware of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, despite a similar percentage being at risk. CKM syndrome links heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and obesity, recognizing that these conditions can mutually exacerbate one another. Health officials emphasize that this interconnectedness increases the risk for major cardiovascular events more than any single factor alone, highlighting the need for holistic prevention strategies.</p>
