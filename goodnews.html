        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film 'Relay,' directed by David Mackenzie, is a modern paranoid thriller centered on a secretive, off-the-grid fixer named Ash, played by Riz Ahmed. Ash specializes in helping whistleblowers disappear or negotiate settlements with powerful entities, using a traceless text-telephone relay service for communication. The plot intensifies when he takes on the case of a biotech scientist, Sarah (Lily James), who is on the run with incriminating documents. The article praises the film's tense, cat-and-mouse narrative and Ahmed's performance, which captures the character's competence and underlying loneliness as he navigates a high-stakes world of corporate espionage.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Virginia is at the forefront of efforts to save endangered species through dedicated research and breeding programs. The facility studies the genetics, reproduction, and ecology of over 20 at-risk species, including the black-footed ferret and Przewalski's horse, with the goal of reintroducing them into their natural habitats. Conservation biologists at the institute express concern over the accelerated rate of extinction, which is estimated to be 10 to 1,000 times the normal background rate. Their work underscores the critical role each species plays in maintaining ecological balance and the cascading negative effects that occur when one is lost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is expected to experience a surge in temperature, reaching up to 30°C (86°F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, contributing to what may be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell, driven by the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country, will provide sunny conditions for major events like the Notting Hill Carnival. However, the heat will be short-lived, with cooler and more unsettled weather predicted to arrive by Tuesday. The hot and dry summer has already led to hosepipe bans and concerns about a poor harvest, highlighting the broader effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight traveling from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport due to a passenger disturbance. The incident occurred late Friday night, and while the airline did not specify the nature of the disruption, the situation was resolved without any arrests being made. Following the diversion, the flight was able to resume its journey, ultimately arriving in Las Vegas approximately three hours behind schedule. According to the FAA, over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents have been reported so far this year, with violators facing significant civil penalties.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent speech hinting at potential interest rate cuts spurred a significant rally on Wall Street, particularly benefiting cyclical, non-tech stocks. Companies like DuPont and Home Depot saw gains, as lower borrowing costs are expected to increase consumer discretionary spending. In contrast, major tech stocks, whose fortunes are more closely tied to the AI boom, saw smaller gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, reflecting market optimism about the Fed's potential shift in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal battle, a central street in Berlin has been officially renamed to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. The street was formerly known as Mohrenstrasse, or "Moor Street," a term with deeply racist and colonial connotations that civil society groups have campaigned against for decades. The renaming ceremony took place on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, marking a significant, though contested, step in Germany's efforts to decolonize public spaces and confront its colonial past. The change reflects a broader movement to re-examine historical narratives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has expanded a previous order, now blocking the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling, issued by Judge William Orrick, protects major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge had previously deemed the administration's attempts to freeze funding unconstitutional. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to compel local jurisdictions to comply with its immigration agenda, a conflict that has escalated with recent threats from the Attorney General.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again, sending fountains of lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, with the activity contained safely within Halemaumau Crater and posing no threat to homes. The frequent and spectacular displays of molten rock have drawn a significant number of visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are closely monitoring the volcano, noting that the current pattern of repeated fountain episodes has occurred only a few times in the last 200 years.</p>

          <p>College sports are rapidly evolving from their amateur roots into a more professionalized system, driven by immense revenue from football and men's basketball. Recent court rulings allowing student-athletes to be paid through endorsements and directly by their schools are accelerating this transformation. This shift is fundamentally changing the experience of college sports, raising questions about the future of non-revenue-generating programs like squash and water polo. The article suggests that as athletes gain the status of employees, the entire structure of NCAA sports will be reshaped, moving further away from the traditional model of student athletics.</p>
