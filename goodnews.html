        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience as employers added 147,000 jobs in June, significantly surpassing economists' predictions of 115,000. This strong performance occurred despite broader signs of slowing economic growth throughout the year. The unemployment rate also saw a positive shift, decreasing to 4.1% from 4.2% in May, which is its lowest point since February. These figures suggest that the job market remains robust, defying concerns about an imminent downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A skydiving plane carrying 15 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, resulting in injuries to everyone on board but no fatalities. Emergency officials declared a mass casualty incident, with injuries ranging from minor to critical. The pilot reported engine trouble after takeoff and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred in a wooded area. The same aircraft was involved in a previous incident in 2023 where it sustained substantial damage during a landing in Virginia.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted two significant housing bills aimed at boosting construction by reforming the state's stringent environmental review process. The new laws, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, exempt most urban, multifamily housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often used to delay or block new developments. This policy shift represents a move away from the state's historical anti-growth sentiment towards prioritizing material abundance to address its severe housing shortage. The reforms were passed despite opposition from some environmental and labor groups.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, founder of the band Dropkick Murphys, remains steadfast in his outspoken criticism of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, viewing it as a betrayal of working-class values. In a recent interview, he discussed his mission to counter what he sees as a "scam" and his willingness to lose fans over his principles, stating he won't "shut up, just out of spite." Casey also recounted a recent concert where he engaged a Trump-supporting fan in a friendly wager over American-made merchandise, which led to a surprisingly civil post-show conversation about family and political division.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural debate is growing among parents about the feasibility of giving children a "90s summer," characterized by unstructured free time, in an era dominated by smartphones and constant supervision. While some parents are opting for fewer organized activities, challenges like full-time work schedules and the allure of digital devices complicate the nostalgic ideal. Experts note that kids have less downtime than in the past, and what free time they have is often spent on screens. However, older teens show a surprising savviness in managing their own device use, suggesting a new form of summer leisure is evolving.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced it will discontinue its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August, consolidating its content into the main Prime Video platform. Launched in 2019, Freevee offered a selection of movies and original series through a standalone app. Following the shutdown, users will be able to access this content on Prime Video for free with ads, even without a Prime membership. This move aligns with Amazon's strategy to simplify its video offerings, which recently included introducing an ad-supported tier to its primary Prime Video service.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Casey Johnston's new book, "A Physical Education," chronicles her journey from calorie-counting cardio to the empowering world of weight lifting, reframing fitness as a pursuit of strength rather than smallness. The book critiques pervasive diet culture and advocates for strength training as a way to build a healthier relationship with one's body, one focused on function, growth, and proper nutrition. This perspective challenges the still-common narrative that a woman's primary fitness goal should be shrinking, offering instead a "why-to" guide for getting "strong as hell."</p>
