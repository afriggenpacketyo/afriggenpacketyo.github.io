          <p>Hang Seng Bank's shares dramatically increased by 29.5% following HSBC's proposal to take its subsidiary private, valuing the bank at over 290 billion Hong Kong dollars (more than $37 billion). HSBC, which already owns about 63% of Hang Seng Bank, aims to strengthen its presence in Hong Kong and enhance both entities' banking operations. The offer, pending shareholder approval, would cancel existing Hang Seng shares in exchange for HK$155 apiece, representing a significant premium. This move underscores HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong's financial market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an "agreed upon line." This marks the "first phase" of a peace deal aimed at ending the two-year conflict in Gaza. Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators facilitated the agreement, which is expected to see hostages released as early as Monday, pending Israeli cabinet approval. Both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas confirmed the deal, with Trump hailing it as a "GREAT Day" for regional peace.</p>

Key issues like Hamas's future, disarmament, and Gaza's long-term governance still require extensive negotiation. Political motivations, including Trump's desire for a Nobel Peace Prize and Netanyahu's need to manage his right-wing government, add further layers of challenge to the implementation of a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>This opinion article advocates for Hong Kong and other cities within the Greater Bay Area to pursue hosting the Olympic Games. The author contends that such a bid offers a powerful and rare opportunity to foster community integration, inspire youth, champion health initiatives, and instill regional pride. Beyond merely enhancing infrastructure and commerce, co-hosting the Olympics could unify distinct communities, dismantling physical and cultural barriers across the region. This endeavor would reshape how people engage with one another as neighbors, teammates, and fellow hosts, elevating the region's global standing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, outlines a roadmap to end the conflict. Key elements include an immediate ceasefire, Hamas releasing all hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli troop withdrawal. The plan also proposes Gaza's demilitarization under independent supervision and governance by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. It aims to deliver full aid to Gaza and offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination, though it sidelines the Palestinian Authority for now.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on an Illinois voting regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election, despite the candidate challenging it, Rep. Michael Bost, having won. Justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned the standing of a winning candidate to claim harm, specifically regarding a reduced margin of victory or staffing costs. The case delves into whether any self-declared candidate can challenge election rules they disagree with, even if unharmed. The discussion highlighted complexities in defining who can sue over election procedures.</p>

While the county denied the claims, attributing her dismissal to performance, Lesley expressed vindication, hoping the settlement sends a message that the First Amendment and anti-discrimination values remain strong in public entities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since returning to the White House in January. This visit comes after a previous comprehensive exam in April, which included cognitive and cardiology tests, and declared him "fully fit." Recent public speculation about his health, fueled by a purplish bruise on his hand, was attributed by his physician to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The White House emphasizes the checkup is routine, amidst the president's busy schedule.</p>
