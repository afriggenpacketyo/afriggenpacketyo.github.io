          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of China's largest mined gold producer, saw its shares surge over 60% during its highly anticipated Hong Kong trading debut. The company successfully raised approximately $3.2 billion, positioning it as the world's second-largest initial public offering this year. This impressive listing capitalizes on gold's recent record highs, driven by strong safe-haven demand, expectations of interest rate cuts, and prevailing global economic uncertainty. The successful debut signifies a notable resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market and strengthens Zijin Mining's strategic focus on its global gold operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong should serve as China's primary hub for engagement with the United Nations, bolstering Beijing's vision of global governance. The city's unique attributes, including its official use of English, common law system, and extremely low corporate taxes, make it an ideal location for a major UN office in Asia. This strategic positioning would not only reinforce China's growing role as a global leader and significant UN donor but also effectively "bring the world to China," fostering international dialogue and collaboration rather than solely focusing on communicating China's narrative to the world.</p>

Wood, 31, described the skit as "mean and unfunny," explaining that speaking out was a deliberate act of breaking a personal pattern of silence, akin to her experiences with bullying during her youth. She expressed contentment with her decision, irrespective of the "chaos" it generated, noting that SNL bosses subsequently issued an an apology. This experience highlights the complexities of public image and the importance of self-advocacy in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results on Tuesday, with investor attention primarily focused on the upcoming interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Analysts widely anticipate the RBA to maintain its cash rate steady at 3.6%, largely due to persistent high inflation that continues to restrict its ability to loosen monetary policy. Any subtle shift in the RBA's tone or forward guidance, particularly after recent volatility in building approvals, could significantly impact the Australian dollar. Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped, while South Korea's Kospi gained, reflecting varied regional market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>LeBron James, on the cusp of his 23rd NBA season, has openly expressed uncertainty regarding his retirement, stating, "I don't know when the end is, but I know it's a lot sooner than later." Despite turning 41 in December, James demonstrated a high level of play last season and remained deeply motivated by his enduring love for the game and the rigorous training process. He will become a free agent after the 2025-26 season if he does not sign an extension with the Lakers. His ultimate decision, he emphasized, will be a personal one made with his wife and daughter, independent of teammates.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Predicts Limited Market Impact from Government Shutdown</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a potential government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, citing historical data that shows mixed market reactions to past shutdowns. His primary concern, however, is that a shutdown could delay the release of crucial economic data, thereby complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. While acknowledging the severe hardship for furloughed federal workers and potential reductions in GDP growth, Cramer emphasizes the critical distinction between a government shutdown and a debt ceiling default. He advises investors to "keep calm and carry on" despite the political impasse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to curb output growth in the non-ferrous metals sector, projecting a modest 1.5% increase this year, a significant reduction from last year's 4.3%. The strategy shifts focus from sheer production volume to optimizing industrial structure and achieving an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output. The plan also prioritizes advancing exploration of critical metals like copper and lithium, developing ultra-pure materials, and enhancing recycling efforts. This initiative aims to address cutthroat competition and depressed processing fees squeezing smelter margins. (not investment advice)</p>

McConaughey eventually felt secure enough in his fame to lift the restriction, allowing his mother the freedom to speak openly.
