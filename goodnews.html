          <h2>Chinese State Media Adopts Supportive Tone Toward Domestic Internet Companies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 08:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese state newspaper, the Economic Daily, has published an editorial signaling a friendlier government stance towards internet platform companies. The article highlighted that innovations improving daily life, such as food delivery, are as crucial to the nation as "hard-tech" breakthroughs like aerospace and chip manufacturing. This shift in tone suggests Beijing may be easing its long-running regulatory crackdown on the country's technology giants, recognizing their role in boosting employment and the domestic economy. The editorial emphasizes a balanced approach, valuing both critical "stranglehold technologies" and consumer-facing digital services.</p>

          <h2>Senior Chinese Official Calls for 'Actionable Results' to Stimulate Domestic Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wang Huning, China's fourth-ranking official, has stressed the strategic importance of expanding domestic demand to ensure the country's long-term economic health. Speaking at a political advisory meeting, he called for more practical research and effective policy implementation to boost consumption. This high-level focus on domestic demand comes as China's economy faces challenges in lifting consumer spending. Analysts anticipate that these remarks may foreshadow new stimulus policies to be announced at the upcoming Politburo meeting at the end of the month.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 07:57:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions, largely due to exceptional performance in its trading divisions. The bank's earnings were $10.91 per share on $14.58 billion in revenue, beating estimates and marking a 22% increase in profit from the previous year. This success was fueled by market volatility from tariff policies, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. The strong performance reflects a broader trend of Wall Street banks benefiting from robust trading activity in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices increasing, following renewed hopes that key stablecoin legislation could pass in the U.S. House this week. Despite a temporary setback when the bills failed to advance, a statement from President Trump suggesting that dissenting Republicans would now support the legislation has bolstered investor confidence. The proposed GENIUS Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, is seen as a significant step for the industry. This legislative optimism has overshadowed recent market volatility and long liquidations, with institutional inflows into crypto ETFs remaining strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the economy potentially slows, some financial analysts are suggesting a strategic pivot for investors away from this year's Big Tech winners. Bob Elliott of Unlimited Funds recommends a portfolio favoring long bonds, gold, and shorting the U.S. dollar to withstand economic headwinds. Separately, Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities sees potential in underperforming defensive sectors like health care, where expectations are low. Sohn also identifies bitcoin as an attractive play, noting that the crypto sector has been a leading category since the market's low in April, suggesting it is becoming an established asset class.

          <p>The Major League Baseball All-Star Game concluded with a historic, first-ever home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie. Philadelphia Phillies' slugger Kyle Schwarber led the National League to victory by hitting three home runs on three swings, overcoming a deficit to secure the win and the MVP award. The new tie-breaking rule, introduced in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, created a dramatic finale reminiscent of a penalty shootout. The American League had taken a 6-0 lead into the seventh inning before the National League staged a late comeback to force the unprecedented conclusion.</p>

          <p>China is actively promoting the international use of its currency, the yuan, with Africa serving as a key testing ground.

These deals aim to increase local currency settlements through China's Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), an alternative to SWIFT. Egypt is the latest African nation to forge such ties, joining countries like South Africa and Nigeria in exploring the use of the yuan for financial transactions with China.</p>

          <p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin stated he is focused on re-earning voter trust by organizing on the ground, rather than getting caught up in "internal bullshit" and party drama. Acknowledging that Democrats need to rebuild relationships with communities, the DNC has launched an "organizing summer" initiative to engage voters well ahead of the midterm elections. Martin's strategy involves listening to voters' concerns and demonstrating a commitment to their communities outside of election cycles. This effort comes as the party navigates internal divisions and seeks a unified path forward after its 2024 election loss.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the LA Times argues that while the All-Star Game's new home run swing-off was exciting, Major League Baseball cannot rely on ties and must innovate to keep its midsummer events relevant. The author suggests changes like adding a judged bat-flip competition to the Home Run Derby to create more viral, social-media-friendly moments. The piece also criticizes the high number of star players who withdraw, particularly pitchers, and proposes moving the game to Wednesday to ease travel logistics. The central theme is that baseball needs to actively work to ensure its best players participate and that its showcase events are genuinely entertaining.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan for its first fiscal quarter, as a strengthening yen curbed the spending spree by foreign tourists. This marks an end to the significant growth the Japanese luxury market had experienced due to a previously weak currency. Despite the downturn in Japan, the company's overall revenue still grew 6% to €5.41 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts, largely thanks to strong performance in its high-end jewelry division. The results show Richemont as a relative bright spot in a broader luxury market downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asset management giant Blackstone has been significantly expanding its portfolio in the U.S. rental housing market, acquiring companies like Tricon Residential and AIR Communities. The firm's strategy focuses on areas with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states and major cities, and its holdings include apartments, student housing, and single-family rentals. Although Blackstone owns less than 1% of the nation's rental homes, its real estate income trust (BREIT) holds an interest in nearly 275,000 units. Analysts suggest the company is well-positioned to benefit as rising construction costs support rent growth in existing properties. (not investment advice)</p>
