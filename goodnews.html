          <p>Chinese Apple supplier Luxshare experienced a significant 10% surge in its shares following a report detailing a new hardware manufacturing deal with OpenAI. The collaboration involves developing a consumer AI device, possibly a smart speaker without a display, with a target launch in late 2026 or early 2027. OpenAI is aggressively expanding its hardware division, recruiting former Apple staff and partnering with ex-Apple designer Jony Ive, bringing a key Apple supplier into its orbit. This strategic move positions OpenAI to challenge Apple's market in dedicated AI devices, reflecting a broader trend of AI companies pushing into consumer hardware and intensifying competition.

          <p>Chinese geologists are utilizing the world's largest antenna and an advanced electromagnetic arsenal to detect deeply buried ore and energy resources, gaining a significant lead in the global race for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths. A study from the China Geological Survey, systematically revealed for the first time, demonstrates this world-leading capability, allowing for resource detection kilometers deep. This strategic advancement underscores China's commitment to securing its supply chain for green technology and positions the nation as a dominant force in resource exploration, potentially intensifying international competition for these vital materials.</p>

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes found his rhythm in the second half, connecting with Tyquan Thornton for key plays, including a 5-yard touchdown and a 33-yard pass setting up another score. The Chiefs' defense also performed strongly, limiting Giants quarterback Russell Wilson to 160 passing yards and sacking him twice.
