          <p>Mount Etna in Italy erupted, sending a large ash cloud high into the sky and triggering a red alert for aviation. The volcanic cloud reached an estimated height of over 21,000 feet and moved in a west-southwest direction. The eruption does not appear to have had any immediate impact on local populations, though tourist visits to the volcano were halted. Officials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, but aviation alerts were later eased as volcanic activity decreased.</p>

Publicly insured and uninsured children would be disproportionately affected. The addition of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered a major public health achievement, but some have questioned its safety.</p>

Many clients spend months or even years mulling over decisions, which adds too many details and makes the decision harder.

The coach recommends avoiding the trap of overanalyzing and instead taking simple steps to make decisions more efficiently.</p>
