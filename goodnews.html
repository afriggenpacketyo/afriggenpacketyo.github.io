A recent poll indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease with the appointment of a new farm minister.</p>

Cruise has seemingly confirmed that The Final Reckoning would be the last instalment of the Mission Impossible franchise. Reviews for both films have been mixed, with some praising the action and adventure while others found the series risked going out with the "fizzled whimper of a message self-destructing in a tape deck."</p>
