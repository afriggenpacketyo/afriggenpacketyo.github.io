          <p>China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, is scheduled to visit Italy and Switzerland for high-level diplomatic meetings. The trip includes attending the 12th joint meeting of the China-Italy government committee and the fourth round of the China-Switzerland strategic dialogue. This visit follows a recent decision by Rome to extend an olive branch to a state-backed Chinese group, Sinochem International Corp, a major shareholder in Italian tyremaker Pirelli, suggesting a potential warming of economic relations.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of longtime leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 assembly seats will be chosen by electoral colleges in various districts, while the remaining third will be appointed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The elections are seen as a test of the interim government's commitment to inclusivity, especially concerning women and minorities, as the country navigates a complex political transition after years of civil war.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in China's major cities is the rise of a "spiritual economy," where consumers, particularly younger generations, are spending on metaphysical and occult activities. Establishments like "spiritual bars" that offer fortune-telling services alongside drinks are becoming increasingly popular nightlife spots for those seeking guidance amid economic uncertainty. This informal economic sector reflects a shift in consumer behavior, as people look for answers and comfort in non-traditional ways, blending entertainment with personal exploration.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though not through the limitless spending many anticipated. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in decades, and consistently qualified for European competition. However, growth has been tempered by Profit and Sustainability Rules, forcing a more gradual build compared to previous disruptors like Manchester City, while human rights concerns about its ownership persist.

          <p>China is shifting its public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers and content creators to reshape its image on the continent. In Kenya, popular online personalities were invited on a tour of China to showcase its culture, scenery, and history to their large youth followings. This "soft power" campaign marks a departure from traditional state-led media approaches, aiming to connect directly with younger African audiences and present a more relatable and positive view of the country.</p>

Richie described this moment of validation as a turning point that convinced him to abandon his religious training and fully commit to a career in music.</p>
