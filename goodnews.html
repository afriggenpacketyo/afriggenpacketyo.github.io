          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is vigorously pursuing the nation's copper potential, aiming to capitalize on soaring global demand driven by electrification and renewable energy initiatives. His administration has implemented the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), a scheme designed to provide generous tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits for major investors over a 30-year period. Companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are already committing substantial capital, with copper projects alone estimated at $16 billion seeking RIGI entry. This article underscores Argentina's strategic pivot to mining as a cornerstone of its economic revitalization efforts, despite the country's history of economic volatility.

Despite this setback and numerous team penalties, Jalen Hurts contributed two rushing touchdowns, and the defense made a critical late-game stop.

          <p>Most bidders seeking to acquire a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers that value the business at approximately US$5 billion, according to informed sources. This potential transaction stands to be one of the most valuable China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent memory. The submitted bids generally reflect a valuation of about 10 times Starbucks China's projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for 2025. This interest indicates Starbucks' readiness to proceed with the sale amidst challenges like sluggish growth and stiff competition from local brands in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>
