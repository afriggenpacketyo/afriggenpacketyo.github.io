          <p>Canada is engaged in high-level discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed these talks, emphasizing the growing missile threats, including those potentially originating from space. While Canada and the US are already partners in NORAD, this consideration comes amid strained relations and Canada's efforts to diversify its trade and security alliances.

The subsidy, which will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, targets a reduction of 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with a goal of reaching a 10-yen reduction by mid-June. The program has no set end date but is expected to last until March 2026, supported by a budget of around 1 trillion yen.

The move aims to enhance Microsoft's AI offerings and attract more developers to its Azure cloud platform. While Microsoft has heavily invested in OpenAI, tensions have risen as OpenAI has begun selling AI products directly to enterprise customers, becoming a competitor.
