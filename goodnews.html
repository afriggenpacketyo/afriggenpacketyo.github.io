          <p>British lender Barclays has significantly raised its full-year financial guidance, now expecting a Return on Tangible Equity greater than 11% and net interest income exceeding £12.6 billion. The bank also announced a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback, accelerating its capital distribution plans and signaling a shift to quarterly buyback announcements. This positive outlook comes despite a third-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.1 billion, which was slightly below analyst expectations, and a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loans scandal. The article highlights strong investment banking returns as a key driver, contributing to a 2.6% rise in Barclays' London-listed shares post-announcement, and notes the bank's shares have surged over 35% year-to-date.

          <p>Apple is reportedly facing considerable engineering challenges in the development of its high-profile foldable iPad, which is envisioned with an 18-inch screen and an estimated cost of around $3,000. Initial plans for a 2028 release have been delayed to 2029 or beyond, primarily due to complexities concerning the device's weight, feature integration, and advanced display technology. This foldable tablet, internally designated J312, is a key component of Apple's broader innovation drive, which also includes the recent ultrathin iPhone Air model and other future devices like smart glasses. The article underscores that perfecting the 18-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology has been particularly demanding and expensive for the company.</p>

He now joins his elder brother, Wang Qianfei, in leading major national research institutes in Beijing. Their father, Wang Qi, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, had named his sons with ambitious meanings, "to fly forward" and "to run forward," which they now embody through their scientific achievements. This article celebrates the reunion of this distinguished scientific family, highlighting their dedication to both traditional Chinese wisdom and modern global science as they contribute to China's scientific advancement.</p>

          <h2>New Study Ranks Antidepressant Side Effects, Revealing Significant Differences</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 02:26:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, uncovering significant differences in their impact on patients. Academics analyzed 151 studies across 30 commonly prescribed drugs, observing effects on weight, heart rate, and blood pressure within the initial eight weeks of treatment. Findings, published in The Lancet, showed variations such as a 2.4kg weight drop with agomelatine versus a nearly 2kg gain with maprotiline. The article stresses that these insights are vital for personalizing antidepressant prescriptions, ensuring drugs are closely matched to individual patient preferences and other health conditions to mitigate potentially clinically important adverse effects, such as increased risk of heart attack or stroke.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly nearing a significant trade deal with the U.S., which could involve Washington substantially reducing tariffs on Indian exports from the current 50% to 15-16%. As part of this agreement, New Delhi is considering scaling back its oil purchases from Russia and potentially increasing its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump's assertions of assurances from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding reduced Russian oil imports, although Modi's office has not explicitly confirmed this aspect. The article underscores India's delicate geopolitical balancing act between prioritizing its consumers' energy interests and strengthening economic and strategic ties with the United States.

The new 400-meter services, running two trains together, will offer approximately 1,080 seats and facilitate new routes to destinations like Geneva and Frankfurt from London. The article highlights Eurostar's planned €80 million investment in its Temple Mills depot in London, which is crucial for accommodating these larger trains and raises questions about capacity for potential rival operators seeking Channel Tunnel access.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading as investors processed new trade data from Japan and observed the country's recent leadership transition. Japanese exports in September climbed 4.2% year-on-year, ending a four-month decline, primarily boosted by robust shipments to Asia, which partially offset a decrease in exports to the U.S. Following this, Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses to trade just above the flatline, while shares of SoftBank saw a significant drop of over 5%. The article highlights that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her new cabinet were sworn in, with key appointments like Shinjiro Koizumi as defense minister and Satsuki Katayama as Japan's first female finance minister, contributing to the regional market's cautious sentiment.

          <p>New York City's mayoral candidates are preparing for their final debate, with Democrat Zohran Mamdani seeking to solidify his frontrunner position. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is actively urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out, arguing Sliwa's presence could inadvertently lead to a Mamdani victory. Sliwa, however, remains committed to the race and has escalated his own criticism of Cuomo. Mamdani intends to focus on local issues and a positive vision for the city, despite anticipating aggressive attacks from Cuomo, similar to their previous debate. The article details the political dynamics, including Cuomo's strategic appeal to conservative voters and Mamdani's challenge to balance defense with maintaining his campaign's hopeful message.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence and fitness for the top position. Musk's attack was prompted by NASA's decision to accept lunar lander proposals from rivals, rather than exclusively relying on SpaceX's Starship system. NASA indicated it would not solely depend on one company, aiming to return astronauts to the moon before China. Despite SpaceX holding a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission, its Starship rocket has faced multiple explosive failures and delays. The article highlights Musk's defense of SpaceX's rapid development and his confident assertion that Starship will ultimately accomplish the entire moon mission.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports saw a rebound in September, climbing 4.2% year-on-year and breaking a four-month decline, primarily propelled by robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China. Conversely, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to fall by 13.3%, even after a trade deal in July reduced U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. Auto shipments to the U.S. were especially affected. The article highlights that while overall external demand is anticipated to recover, ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions cast a shadow over the outlook. The new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's stance on loose monetary policy could weaken the yen, potentially benefiting Japanese exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

His appeal follows a government consultation on AI and copyright, which garnered 11,500 responses.
