          <p>The Atlantic discusses the recurring theme of Joe Biden's age and its impact on his presidency, noting how concerns about his fitness for office have been a constant topic of discussion. The article references a new book, 'Original Sin,' which portrays Biden as frail and out of touch, highlighting instances where he forgot names and had internal discussions about using a wheelchair. The author argues that while the 'cover-up' of Biden's condition is problematic, it's difficult to hide something so apparent to the public eye. Despite efforts to portray him otherwise, Biden's public appearances often reinforced the perception of his infirmity, making the issue hard to ignore.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence in lower-risk groups. The agency urges vaccine makers to conduct randomized studies in adults aged 50-64 and children under 5, with potential interim results available by next year.</p>

          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone on the impact of President Trump's tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports will soon lead to increased prices for consumers. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices. This announcement risks drawing Trump's public criticism, as he has previously attacked companies opposing his agenda. Walmart's decision to warn of higher prices is driven by a sense of obligation to explain the reasons behind potential price increases to customers and investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to unveil plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the 'Golden Dome,' to protect the United States against missile threats. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, echoes President Ronald Reagan's 'Star Wars' program and could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Trump's proposal, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, aims to defend against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. Questions remain about the scope and cost of the system, as well as its potential impact on other vital programs within the Defense Department.</p>
