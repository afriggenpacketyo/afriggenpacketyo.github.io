          <p>The Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade commemorating its 250th anniversary.

The parade will feature historical reenactors, flyovers, and a constitutional oath ceremony for new recruits, with costs estimated between $25 million and $45 million, plus additional security expenses. The parade will trace the Army's evolution from the Revolutionary War to the modern U.S. Army of Tomorrow.</p>

The affluent coastal enclave has been closed to the public since the January wildfire, and the reopening of PCH necessitates the establishment of new security checkpoints.</p>

The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons to ban the play, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the tush push.
