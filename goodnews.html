          <p>This opinion article posits that the deeply polarized narratives surrounding the South China Sea disputes necessitate a new strategy to foster de-escalation. The author argues that the core of the conflict stems from conflicting interpretations of post-World War II territorial arrangements and a clash between historical claims and modern legal frameworks. A joint, fact-based, and truly collaborative process is proposed as a potential starting point to narrow this perception gap and move toward a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>The article delves into the history of the thong, revealing it was created as a form of protest by Austrian-American designer Rudi Gernreich. Following a 1974 ban on public nudity at Los Angeles beaches, Gernreich designed the minimalist garment to challenge societal prudery and advocate for bodily freedom. A prominent gay rights activist and pioneer of unisex fashion, he viewed his creations, including the infamous topless "monokini," as a means to liberate the body from sexualization and restrictive social norms.</p>
