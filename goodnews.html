          <p>A new report by ICF forecasts a dramatic surge in electricity demand in the United States, potentially rising by 78% by 2050, which could strain the reliability and affordability of the power grid. This increase is attributed to factors like rising temperatures, emerging technologies such as cryptocurrency mining, data centers, and the adoption of electric vehicles. Retail electricity costs are also expected to double by 2050, with a projected 6% jump in 2025, costing households an average of $784 during the summer period. Grid operators are already warning of high peak demand during the summer months, urging consumers to prepare for potential challenges.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following controversy over his comment that he doesn't buy rice because he receives it from supporters, a remark that sparked outrage as rice prices have doubled. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will appoint Shinjiro Koizumi as his replacement. Eto's resignation comes shortly after the agriculture ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to curb rising prices. Public support for Ishiba's cabinet has declined sharply amid concerns over the government's handling of the rice price crisis.</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means that many healthy Americans may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for approval to administer shots to all healthy persons between 6 months and 64 years old. The FDA's new leadership emphasizes the need for evidence-based strategies and recognizes the division in America over repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses.</p>

          <p>A temporary truce between the US and China on tariffs has eased concerns about a damaging trade decoupling. The Geneva negotiations yielded better-than-expected results, boosting confidence in financial markets. While the scaled-back tariffs still impact bilateral trade, the agreement suggests that neither side wants to sever economic ties completely. There is cautious optimism that further tariff reductions are possible after the 90-day period, as most expect tariffs to either hold steady or decrease further.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, yet shares fell in extended trading, possibly because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics. Despite the stock's drop, analysts believe the cybersecurity company is well-positioned for future growth, driven by its next-generation security suite, particularly its AI-powered Cortex XSIAM. The company's platformization strategy, aimed at getting customers to consolidate their cybersecurity spending, is showing momentum. Cybersecurity spending remains resilient, and the company has several trends going its way, consolidation, the elevated threat environment, bad actors becoming more sophisticated, data proliferation, and artificial intelligence.
