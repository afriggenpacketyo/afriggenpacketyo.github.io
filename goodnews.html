          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best day in five years, jumping 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The insurer had been struggling, with its stock down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The significant investment from such a prominent figure is seen by market analysts as a major vote of confidence, potentially signaling a turning point for the company and the managed care sector.

The article suggests that variable-rate HELOCs may become cheaper if rates fall, as they can adjust more quickly than fixed-rate home equity loans. However, it advises borrowers to also consider the predictability of fixed payments versus the volatility of variable ones to determine the best fit for their financial situation.

          <p>A research team at Tianjin University in China has created a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. The team has established a pilot production line for the battery, which could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles and alleviate "range anxiety" for consumers. If successfully scaled, this technological advancement could also dramatically increase the endurance of devices like drones.</p>

While this is a positive outcome for students, it highlights the underlying financial instability within the higher education sector that could have future knock-on effects.</p>
