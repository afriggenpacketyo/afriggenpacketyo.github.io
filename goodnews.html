          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a "positive response" to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, stating it is ready for immediate negotiations. However, the group has requested several significant changes, including an end to a U.S.-backed aid system and a guarantee that the war will not resume if permanent truce talks fail. The development comes amid ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and rallies by hostage families in Tel Aviv urging for a deal to be made. U.S. President Trump expressed cautious optimism, suggesting a deal could be possible within the next week.</p>

          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has reignited the conversation about whether crying at work is a sign of weakness or strength. This article explores changing attitudes, with many professionals and experts now viewing emotional expression as a component of emotional intelligence rather than a liability. Anecdotes from both men and women reveal that crying at work is not uncommon and can stem from various pressures or personal issues. Career coaches argue that compassionate employers who support emotional well-being are more likely to foster a motivated and productive workforce.</p>

          <h2>Buy Now, Pay Later Activity to Be Included in FICO Credit Score Calculations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its scoring models this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of these installment payment plans, particularly among younger and lower-income consumers. For consumers, this means that making timely BNPL payments could help build a positive credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their scores. Lenders have sought this data for a more complete financial picture of applicants, though consumer advocates note BNPL services lack some protections offered by traditional credit cards.

          <p>The Ethereum blockchain is increasingly being integrated as the core infrastructure for traditional finance, a trend highlighted at the recent EthCC conference in Cannes. Major financial institutions are now building on its network, with Robinhood launching tokenized U.S. stocks and Deutsche Bank developing a tokenization platform on an Ethereum-based system. Despite price volatility, institutions are drawn to Ethereum's reputation for stability, security, and decentralization as they explore on-chain assets. This institutional adoption signals a significant shift for the cryptocurrency, moving it from a niche experiment to a potential backbone of global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's state-owned energy giant, Sinopec, has launched a significant new floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. This project is part of a larger initiative that, combined with another recent installation, will form the company's largest offshore photovoltaic endeavor. The completed projects are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The innovative design, which places solar panels on the ocean's surface, also reportedly boosts energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent.</p>

          <p>Following recent Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a new international agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and advocated for placing Iran's nuclear activities under strict IAEA supervision. This diplomatic push positions China as a potential mediator while intensifying its criticism of the U.S. and Israel. The call for a new framework aims to de-escalate the conflict and prevent what Wang warned could become a "nuclear disaster."</p>

          <p>Two recent studies offer different conclusions on the long-debated question of whether culture shapes how we see the world. One study on the Coffer illusion found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments see rectangles while rural Namibians see circles, supporting the theory. However, another study convincingly argues that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent, as it even affects animals and the congenitally blind. This article suggests that perception is an active construction by the brain, highlighting the need to study perceptual diversity both between and within different cultural groups.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, the Seine River in Paris has been officially reopened for public swimming. The historic move is a legacy of the massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort undertaken for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Authorities have established three supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, allowing residents and tourists to cool off in the iconic river. The river was banned to swimmers in 1923 due to severe pollution, and its reopening marks a major milestone in urban environmental restoration.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has made a significant breakthrough by discovering a "genetic switch" that enables organ regeneration. In a study published in *Science*, the researchers successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue, including cartilage, in mice by activating this switch. The key was found to be retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, which plays a crucial role in cell development. While human application is still a distant goal, this discovery proves the principle of reactivating regenerative abilities and offers hope for future medical treatments.</p>

The AI-powered search led him to a robotic, microscopic procedure offered at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center, which allowed for a much faster recovery. The story highlights the potential benefits of AI in empowering patients to explore their healthcare options. However, his surgeon cautions that while patient research is helpful, it cannot replace the guidance of trained medical professionals, as AI can sometimes provide unreliable information.</p>
