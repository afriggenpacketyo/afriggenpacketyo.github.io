          <h2>Debate Over Equality in Professional Cycling Continues Amid Tour de France Femmes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 04:16:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tour de France Femmes highlights the ongoing financial disparities within professional cycling, with significant gaps in prize money and salaries compared to the men's sport. While the winner of the men's Tour receives €500,000, the women's champion earns only €50,000. Race director Marion Rousse defends the structure, noting the women's prize is higher than in comparable men's races and pointing to positive developments. These signs of progress include the race expanding to nine days, growing television ratings, and the introduction of a minimum wage for top-tier female cyclists.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the current state of the WNBA, exploring truths and fictions surrounding its growth, the impact of rookie star Caitlin Clark, and critiques of the league. It addresses debates over player rankings, noting that while fans voted Clark first for the All-Star game, players ranked her ninth, reflecting a different perspective on her on-court effectiveness versus her popularity. The analysis suggests the league is not overly dependent on a single player, pointing to strong viewership, rising attendance, and a deep talent pool as signs of the WNBA's overall health and positive trajectory.</p>

          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rebounded in June, Boosted by Warm Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound driven by warm weather that spurred consumer spending on fuel and supermarket items. According to the Office for National Statistics, people bought more drinks and summer clothing as they took advantage of the sunshine. This rise follows a revised 2.8% drop in May, and while the rebound was expected, some economists found it disappointingly small. The data suggests that overall retail spending momentum has slowed in the second quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Euro 2025 final, this article provides a tactical analysis of the matchup between England and Spain. Key areas of focus include how England's dynamic forwards can exploit Spain's high defensive line and the critical need to disrupt Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to their pivot players. The analysis suggests that while Spain will likely dominate possession, England is well-suited to play a transitional game and can draw lessons from Germany's semi-final performance against the world champions. The potential impact of England's substitutes is also highlighted as a crucial factor.</p>

          <h2>President Trump's Scotland Visit Presents Opportunity for UK to Finalize Trade Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland includes an informal meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which is being viewed as an opportunity to finalize key aspects of a recent trade deal. While a baseline agreement is in place, unresolved issues remain, including the removal of a 25% U.S. tariff on British steel and aluminum and disagreements over the U.K.'s digital services tax. Analysts suggest these topics will be central to the discussions, with potential for a compromise that could see the U.S. tariffs reduced in exchange for concessions on the tech tax.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As an August 1 deadline for a trade deal with the U.S. nears, after which tariffs could rise, India appears to be in a strong negotiating position. Analysts suggest New Delhi is unfazed due to its critical strategic value to the U.S. as a counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific and as a potential alternative for global manufacturing supply chains. Furthermore, India has been actively diversifying its trade partnerships, including a recent deal with the U.K., which gives it additional leverage and reduces its dependency on a single agreement with Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has voiced opposition to expanding the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in the sport. He stated that there is no need to widen VAR's authority to include decisions on corner kicks or second yellow cards, arguing that the system in its current form already creates "enough interruptions to the game." This position comes amid reports that football's law-making body, IFAB, could be asked to consider such an expansion, a move the FA would not support.</p>

          <p>In a UK-first initiative, the Welsh government will provide people with coeliac disease and other gluten-related conditions with pre-loaded debit cards to purchase food. This new system offers an alternative to the traditional method of obtaining specific gluten-free items on prescription from a pharmacy. The goal is to "de-medicalise" the process, offering patients greater choice and dignity when shopping at supermarkets and other stores. While the move is praised for its flexibility, some participants in a pilot program noted the financial allotment only partially covers the higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>Despite facing increased pressure after a 7-6 season, USC football coach Lincoln Riley states he feels "refreshed and recharged" heading into his fourth year. He attributes his calm to having a more established program, allowing him to focus on "finishes" rather than major fixes. Riley expresses confidence in the team's progress, particularly the improved talent and size on the defensive line, and has reiterated his belief in starting quarterback Jayden Maiava. The program's momentum is also bolstered by securing the nation's top-ranked recruiting class for 2026.</p>

This move reinforces the trilateral agreement, which also includes the United States, and comes as officials emphasize the indivisible security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions amid growing concerns over China's military expansion.</p>
