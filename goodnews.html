          <h2>Government Fast-Tracks New Reservoir Projects to Bolster Water Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:49:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has fast-tracked two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire, declaring them "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process. This move aims to secure England's water supplies amid rising temperatures, population growth, and the increasing risk of drought due to climate change. While the projects are intended to provide resilience by collecting excess rainfall, they face potential local objections and could take over a decade to complete. Experts also emphasize the need for managing water usage and reducing waste, suggesting a comprehensive approach to water security is essential.</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Order Blocking Trump's Tariffs, Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:48:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, arguing that the Constitution places limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade's decision states that Trump surpassed these limits and reads federal trade laws to constrain his ability to continue his trade war. The court's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but if upheld, Trump may not be able to reimpose the sweeping tariffs. The three-judge panel unanimously agreed that the tariffs are illegal, concluding that the statute cannot be read to give Trump unchecked authority over tariffs because, if Congress had intended to give Trump that power, then the statute would violate the Constitution‚Äôs separation of powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from southern Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes that they might nest in the area. This resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles. The birds have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The population in southern Scotland has risen to approximately 50, and conservationists are hopeful that a breeding population will establish itself in England.</p>

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning its attention to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza was within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. The administration is also optimistic about brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran, although key gaps remain. Trump has taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stating it would be inappropriate to strike Iranian nuclear facilities during negotiations.</p>

The combined annual recurring revenue (ARR) for Data Cloud and Agentforce is now over $1 billion. While revenue and earnings guidance came in above expectations, investors were tempered by the fact that the company is benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar. Despite the foreign exchange tailwinds, Salesforce maintained its subscription and support revenue growth of roughly 9% on a constant currency basis (not investment advice).</p>
