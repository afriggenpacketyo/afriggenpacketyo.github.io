          <p>His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Andy Cooke, has recommended that police in England and Wales should cease recording non-crime hate incidents. He argued that the current legislation places officers in a difficult position and that a clear distinction must be made between offensive speech and criminal acts to better protect free expression. The head of the Metropolitan Police supported this call, highlighting the need for more officer discretion following public debate over police actions related to social media posts.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced gains, largely propelled by a significant surge in the share price of Inditex, the parent company of Zara. The fashion retailer's stock jumped after it reported that its new collections were well-received, resulting in a 9% year-on-year sales increase in early autumn trading. This positive corporate news helped to counterbalance broader market concerns, including potential new tariffs requested by the U.S. and anticipation of upcoming inflation data from the United States.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an artificial intelligence system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This robotic "third hand" can perform routine tasks like retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, allowing surgeons to concentrate on more complex aspects of the procedure. The innovation, detailed in the journal Science Robotics, aims to alleviate the strain on surgical staff and could potentially reduce patient wait times by addressing the growing clinical demand from an aging population.</p>

          <p>Chinese aircraft manufacturer Comac has received one of its largest-ever overseas orders for its C909 regional passenger jets from the newly established Air Cambodia. This deal represents a significant step in expanding the presence of Chinese-made aircraft in Southeast Asia, as Cambodia becomes the fourth nation in the region to operate the C909. The aircraft, which is designed for short-haul flights with a capacity of 78 to 97 seats, is a central component of China's strategy to compete with established Western planemakers.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have both publicly expressed optimism about resolving their ongoing trade disputes, signaling a potential de-escalation after months of friction. Trump stated on social media that he looked forward to speaking with Modi and saw a path to a "successful conclusion," a sentiment Modi quickly reciprocated. This softer rhetoric emerges despite persistent disagreements over tariffs and India's significant purchases of Russian oil, which have previously drawn sharp criticism from Washington.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Das Minsk museum in Potsdam is exploring the complex cultural and social legacy of East Germany's prefabricated concrete slab buildings, known as "Plattenbau."

The exhibition utilizes various artworks to delve into the collective memory associated with these buildings, examining them as spaces of community, social change, and painful transformation for millions of Germans.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a leading candidate for mayor of New York City, possesses a complex identity that has sparked debate in the U.S. but is viewed differently in his birthplace of Uganda. Born in Kampala to an Indian mother and a father of Indian descent, Mamdani is considered by many Ugandans to be unequivocally African, reflecting the country's long history of a multi-hyphenated "African Indian" community. The article explores how this identity fits within the distinct cultural and historical context of Uganda, providing a contrast to American racial categorizations.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results with only two Premier League wins since April, underlying statistics suggest Manchester United's on-field performances have been stronger than their point tally implies. The team ranks highly in shots taken and low in shots conceded, but has significantly underperformed in both scoring goals and preventing them relative to the quality of chances created. This analysis indicates that issues with individual player execution in finishing and goalkeeping, rather than the team's overall tactical setup, may be the primary cause of recent struggles.</p>
