        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), targeted medicines that deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, potentially replacing traditional chemotherapy in some cases. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADCs, which aim to minimize side effects by sparing healthy cells. While challenges remain in refining these treatments, some companies claim ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. Drugmakers are working to overcome these issues by developing next-generation ADCs and combination regimens.</p>
