          <p>China has launched a comprehensive 19-point plan to boost service consumption and expand domestic demand for economic growth. The measures include relaxing market access and increasing supply in culture, sports, and healthcare industries. Authorities also pledged to strengthen fiscal support, attract foreign investment, and adjust school holiday schedules to encourage travel. Furthermore, financial institutions are encouraged to provide more loans and interest subsidies for consumer spending in key areas, reflecting Beijing's commitment to leveraging internal demand for economic stability and growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point, initiating discussions among economists and investors about the future trajectory of borrowing costs. The central bank typically employs either a measured pace for modest adjustments or rapid cuts during economic deterioration. Most analysts anticipate a "recalibration" approach, with potentially five rate reductions by mid-next year to maintain economic growth. However, persistently elevated inflation, partly due to tariffs, could temper the speed of these cuts, despite a recent slowdown in hiring strengthening the case for monetary easing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. signifies a strategic opportunity for Britain to deepen trade and business ties with the U.S. The U.K. often uses royal state visits to foster economic relationships, a practice dubbed "tiara diplomacy." This particular visit holds increased importance given the U.K.'s stagnating economy and Trump's favorable disposition towards the country. Numerous multi-billion-dollar deals, particularly in AI and nuclear energy, have been announced, with companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, and Blackstone pledging significant investments. The visit aims to boost British confidence and establish AI sovereignty.</p>

          <p>China's renowned Yiwu International Trade Market, once a global supermarket, is experiencing a significant shift in its customer base away from the U.S. due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Exports from Yiwu to the U.S. have declined, mirroring a national trend, while trade with the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa has surged. This pivot reflects Chinese suppliers seeking more stable markets, even if they offer lower margins. The article highlights that increased U.S. tariffs and new cargo fees are making American markets less attractive for Chinese businesses, prompting a strategic reorientation in global trade.</p>

          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened significantly against the US dollar, surpassing 7.1 for the first time in nearly a year. This appreciation comes ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve this week. Economists suggest that the Fed's easing will likely contribute to the US dollar's depreciation, further bolstering the yuan's stability and strength. This movement marks another milestone in China's gradual monetary policy shift, indicating a positive outlook for the yuan in the global currency market as international economic conditions evolve.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a smaller-than-anticipated contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from July's 2.6% decline. This milder contraction was largely due to a rebound in shipments to Asia, its largest trading region, and a sharp jump in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the U.S. continued to fall steeply, particularly in autos, despite a recent trade deal. While overall export volumes are holding up against U.S. tariffs, economists project a potential shrinkage in 2026 due to anticipated slower external demand. The data precedes the Bank of Japan's rate decision.</p>
