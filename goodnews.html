          <p>Major Chinese technology companies are launching significant hiring initiatives, prioritizing graduates with science and technology degrees to foster domestic innovation. This trend, exemplified by Xiaomi's recent global hiring announcement for roles in software research and hardware development, is a direct response to tightening U.S. export controls on advanced technologies. By cultivating local talent, Chinese firms aim to reduce their dependence on foreign technology and maintain their competitive edge on the global stage, encouraging a new generation of jobseekers to pursue STEM careers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to specific, tailored zones where they are allowed to be, rather than just excluding them from certain areas, a change intended to give victims greater peace of mind. While supported by victims' advocates, the plan has raised concerns among probation officers about increased workloads on an already strained service. The Ministry of Justice states it will hire more staff and use enhanced GPS tagging technology to enforce the zones.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Luka Doncic was recently spotted driving a newly acquired Rimac Nevera, a rare all-electric hypercar with a price tag of approximately $2 million. With only 150 units produced worldwide, the Croatian-made vehicle is the world's fastest electric car. The purchase comes after Doncic signed a $165 million contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, securing his long-term future with the team. Fans reacted online with a mix of awe and humor, with some joking that his recent physical transformation was motivated by a desire to fit into the exclusive car.</p>
