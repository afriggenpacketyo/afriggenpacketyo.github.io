          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting announced it will return "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemption that began after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about a conservative activist's death. The late-night show was suspended by Disney's ABC for six days, but Sinclair and other station owners had continued to withhold it. In its statement, Sinclair emphasized its responsibility to provide programming that serves community interests while honoring network obligations. Another major affiliate owner, Nexstar, has not yet indicated when it will resume airing the program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid declining interest rates following a recent Federal Reserve cut, savers have fewer high-yield opportunities, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) soon may still be advantageous. Key reasons include locking in current rates, which are still around 4.50%, before they potentially drop further and allowing interest to compound immediately. With a high probability of another Fed rate cut at the end of October, banks may preemptively lower their CD rates. Therefore, proactive savers might benefit from securing a fixed rate now to ensure predictable returns on their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a Thursday night game against the Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba's frustrated exclamation was accidentally broadcast over the referee's open microphone. After a holding penalty nullified a teammate's touchdown, Smith-Njigba yelled an expletive which was clearly audible as head referee Alex Kemp was announcing the penalty. Kemp paused and glared at the player but did not issue a further penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, a decision praised by the broadcast commentators. Despite the penalty, the Seahawks ultimately won the game 23-20.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn after voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, defying the party line shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their reinstatement comes as the Labour government signals a potential softening of its stance on the controversial policy, with key ministers suggesting its removal is "on the table." The move is seen as a step toward party unity ahead of the annual conference.</p>

The initiative aims to celebrate the courage involved in living authentically and to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ rights. Coming out is presented as a personal choice and a significant step in self-acceptance rather than a request for permission. Select stories submitted by the public may be featured in NPR's 'Up First' newsletter, providing a platform for diverse experiences to be heard and honored.</p>

          <h2>FAA Eases Restrictions, Allowing Boeing to Self-Certify Some 737 MAX and 787 Aircraft</h2>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some of its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reversing a policy enacted after years of safety crises. The FAA had stripped Boeing of this authority for the MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production flaws. Under the new plan, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks. This decision signals growing regulatory confidence in the manufacturer's quality control, though the FAA maintains a production cap on the 737 MAX.</p>

          <p>Arts and crafts retailer Michaels is resurrecting the Joann fabric brand by introducing dedicated "Knit & Sew Shop" sections within its stores. This move follows Joann's bankruptcy and the closure of all its standalone locations earlier in the year. Michaels, which acquired Joann's intellectual property, will feature Joann's branding and popular private-label products, like Big Twist yarn, in over 800 of its locations. The expansion aims to capture the market share left by the closures of specialty stores like Joann and Party City, making Michaels a dominant player in the fabric retail space.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the potential monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners looking to borrow a large sum. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. These payments are modestly lower than they were earlier in the year, potentially saving borrowers around $1,900 over a decade. The article suggests this could be a viable borrowing option, especially with more rate cuts anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite some concerns over a minor decline in membership renewal rates and a gross margin miss, many Wall Street analysts remain optimistic. They highlight the company's consistent performance, strong traffic, and the successful acquisition of younger members through online signups, maintaining buy ratings on the stock.

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils to Indonesia, including parts of the historic "Java Man." These fossils, the first known remains of the human ancestor Homo erectus, were discovered on the Indonesian island of Java in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois when the country was a Dutch colony. The decision follows a recommendation from a Dutch committee, which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past.</p>

The fan, Glenn Mutti-Driscoll, decided the young stranger, Marcus Rueblos, deserved the potentially valuable memento more than he did. Instead of seeking a large payout, Marcus chose to return the ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat, stating the ball meant more to the player. The Mariners later honored Mutti-Driscoll's generosity by inviting him to meet Raleigh and receive his own signed bat.</p>

In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized 8,700 pounds of cocaine north of Panama.

          <p>The "rule of thirds" is an emerging retirement strategy designed to provide both security and flexibility for retirees concerned about outliving their savings. The approach involves converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth or used for discretionary spending and unexpected costs. This method aims to create a stable financial foundation, blending a pension-like income stream with accessible funds to navigate market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
