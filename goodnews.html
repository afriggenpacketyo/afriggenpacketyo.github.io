          <p>Chinese company Zhongman Petroleum has drilled 193 wells in Egypt's West Minya to irrigate a 500-hectare desert area, now home to the world's largest beet sugar factory.

Zhongman used air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This initiative is part of China's broader effort to export agricultural technology to emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East, reflecting a strategic alignment to address development challenges.

          <p>Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is progressing towards offering a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to investors. NYSE Arca filed to list a bitcoin fund linked to Trump's media company, signaling an expansion into the crypto world. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF aims to track bitcoin's price, providing easier exposure for investors without direct asset holding. This follows a partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to introduce digital asset products, pending regulatory approval, and would make it one of the most politically connected entries into the booming market for bitcoin funds.

          <p>Following a national outcry, the Trump administration reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl receiving life-saving treatment in the US and her family. The family had come to the US in 2023 for specialized medical care for their daughter's rare condition, but their humanitarian parole was terminated, and they were ordered to self-deport. Doctors warned that the girl would likely die if forced to return to Mexico, leading to a fight against the deportation order.

          <p>The California Senate has passed a bill to make AI chatbots safer, particularly for companionship, after concerns were raised about their impact on children's mental health. Senate Bill 243 requires operators of companion chatbot platforms to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters aren't human and disclose that the chatbots might not be suitable for some minors. Platforms would also need to implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation or self-harm expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources. The bill now heads to the California State Assembly, showing how lawmakers are addressing AI safety concerns while balancing innovation.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo in 2018 following a scandal involving the creation of fake accounts. These restrictions, including an asset cap, were put in place due to a toxic sales culture that led employees to open unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced that each of the bank's 215,000 employees would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around. With the removal of the asset cap, Wells Fargo can now pursue growth opportunities, including higher deposits and new accounts, signaling a potential return to normalcy after years of regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily spared from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. This exemption depends on the US-UK tariff pact signed in May, which would eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs but has yet to take effect. The order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries from Wednesday, but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. The UK government said it is "committed to protecting British business and jobs" and will "continue to work with the US to implement our agreement." Uncertainty remains over the timings and final tariff rates.</p>
