          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrists holding off hard-right breakthroughs, though discontent with mainstream parties persists. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, defeated George Simion, a hard-line nationalist aligned with Trump. Poland's election was less decisive, with Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, securing a narrow lead over Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian, setting up a runoff. The big shock in Poland was the 6.3 percent won by Grzegorz Braun, a nationalist firebrand known for anti-Semitic stunts. These elections highlight the fragmentation of political movements and growing dissatisfaction with established parties.</p>

The sale of some British meat products in the European Union will be possible again and some border checks on animal and plant products will end.

          <p>According to Microsoft's recent report, employees are interrupted every two minutes by meetings, emails, and other pings during the workday.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting the leadership of the European Union (EU) at a summit in London, and has inked agreements calling for deepening defense and trade ties. An agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen to have access to British waters for an extended period of 12 years in exchange for the EU indefinitely easing red tape on food and drink imports and exports. The eased customs checks on food and plant products are expected to add "nearly 9 billion pounds" ($12 billion/‚Ç¨10.7 billion) to the British economy by 2040.</p>
