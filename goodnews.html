        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Canada Goose experienced a significant surge of approximately 20% following the release of their fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which surpassed analysts' estimates. Despite this positive outcome, the company has chosen to withdraw its fiscal 2026 outlook, citing prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties. The luxury retailer emphasized its confidence in the brand's resilience and financial stability, highlighting its ability to adapt to evolving market conditions, with approximately 75% of Canada Goose units being manufactured in Canada and largely compliant with US trade agreements, thus minimizing the impact of tariffs. The company is focusing on product category expansion to strengthen year-round relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced that it will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups, such as seniors and those with underlying conditions, but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means that many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's Vinay Prasad stated that this change reflects the division in America regarding repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses. Experts like Dr. C√©line Gounder express skepticism, noting the difficulty and expense of conducting the required clinical trials.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, highlighting the advantages of telework when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking, and available regulatory guidance.

Telework also delivers cost savings and measurable productivity gains, but building a cohesive culture in distributed teams requires intentional effort and clear communication protocols.</p>

          <p>Callable CDs may offer higher interest rates compared to traditional CDs, but they come with the risk of the bank recalling or redeeming the CD before its full term. Experts suggest callable CDs are worth considering if the rate is significantly higher and there's a call protection period. However, if you prefer stability and predictability, traditional CDs or high-yield savings accounts might be more suitable.

This program, Viviendo con Felinos, has expanded the protected area for jaguars and helped shift ranchers' attitudes toward coexistence with these predators. The success of this approach bodes well for restoring jaguars to the US, but the border wall remains a significant obstacle.</p>
