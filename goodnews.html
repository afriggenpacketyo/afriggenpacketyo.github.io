          <p>A recent report from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicates that the trust fund responsible for paying retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033, which is unchanged from last year's projections; at that point, only 77% of scheduled benefits will be payable. The combined trust funds, including disability insurance, are expected to last until 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, at which point 81% of combined benefits will be payable. The report considers the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners, but excludes the potential impacts of new tax proposals, tariffs, and deportations. Disability insurance is expected to be able to pay full benefits through at least 2099. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its cautious approach while assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. Despite anticipating a rise in inflation, the central bank still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, consistent with its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and improvements in sentiment, but also noted that tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention, marking a significant milestone in efforts to curb the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data indicates the injection provides near-complete protection against HIV infection, offering a more convenient alternative to daily pills. The drug, marketed as Yeztugo, has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S., and Gilead Sciences is taking steps to broaden access, but high costs and potential cuts to foreign aid could limit its reach. The drug's efficacy was demonstrated in clinical trials, with one showing 100% effectiveness among cisgender women.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a trial that garnered significant public attention. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene, but convicted her of driving while intoxicated, resulting in a one-year probation order. Read maintained her innocence, with her defense arguing she was framed, and expressed gratitude to her supporters after the verdict.

However, the launch faces potential threats, including proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts, and the drug has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S. Gilead has granted licenses to generic manufacturers to produce and sell lower-cost versions in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries.</p>

While some Republicans endorse the use of force if diplomacy fails, others emphasize the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that a U.S. strike on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, a suspected underground nuclear weapons site, would pose a limited risk of widespread contamination. The facility primarily processes uranium isotopes in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas, which is heavy and unlikely to travel far. Although there are concerns about the gas reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground location and the design of bunker busters would likely inhibit any significant environmental release. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iranian facilities.</p>
