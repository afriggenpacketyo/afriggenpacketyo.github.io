          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a loan move to FC Barcelona, with an agreement in principle said to be in place. The transfer, which includes an option to buy, would fulfill Rashford's stated preference for the Spanish club following a challenging period at United where he was training separately from the first team. For Manchester United, the move would provide significant salary relief, aiding their efforts to fund new signings under coach Ruben Amorim. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for the 27-year-old English player, who has been with his hometown club since 2016.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting the meeting occur next week to increase the momentum of negotiations. The proposal comes as Ukraine continues to face intense Russian aggression, including recent overnight attacks involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. In addition to the diplomatic push, Ukraine is also addressing the issue of its citizens being deported by Russia into Georgia, evacuating 43 individuals from a holding site. Meanwhile, international support continues, with Australia confirming the delivery of 49 Abrams tanks as part of a significant military aid package for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>According to a recent SEC filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, with the transaction valued at approximately $12.94 million. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which Huang is authorized to sell up to 6 million shares. The move comes as Nvidia's market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company, largely driven by the immense demand for its AI-powering graphics processing units. The company also recently announced it expects to resume sales of its specialized H20 chips to China following favorable signals from the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in a physical first Test match, with flankers Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry delivering standout performances. Curry, in particular, responded to recent criticism with a dominant display, contributing a try and setting a relentlessly aggressive tone from the start. Coach Andy Farrell praised his players as "immense," highlighting their ability to perform in high-pressure situations. Despite a late-game lapse in discipline that allowed Australia to narrow the score, the Lions' early physicality and control were enough to secure the crucial victory as they head into the second Test in Melbourne with a series lead.</p>

          <p>An article from The Guardian follows members of Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Catholic group, as they engage with young people on the Jersey shore to promote a message of chastity before marriage. The activists frame chastity not merely as abstinence but as a countercultural stance against a hyper-sexualized and superficial society, which they believe is exacerbated by social media. They find common ground with peers by discussing the negative impacts of online culture on relationships and self-esteem. This approach attempts to rebrand a traditional religious value as a modern solution for Gen Z's anxieties about connection, authenticity, and mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Thymen Arensman secured his first Tour de France stage victory on a grueling day in the Pyrenees, giving his team, Ineos Grenadiers, its first win of this year's race. The major story of the day, however, was the withdrawal of Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall but was forced to abandon the race after faltering on the Col du Tourmalet. Meanwhile, overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his lead by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard. Evenepoel's departure reshuffles the general classification, with Florian Lipowitz moving into the third podium position.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially expected, providing a potential boost for the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already resumed running, agility drills, and taking swings without significant discomfort. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism that Muncy will return "a lot sooner than anticipated" from the injury, which was originally projected to sideline him for six weeks. Muncy's absence has been keenly felt, as the Dodgers' offensive production has dropped significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list.</p>

          <p>A combination of strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data helped the S&P 500 achieve a modest weekly gain, though concerns over potential new tariffs tempered the market. The June Consumer Price Index showed core inflation slightly below expectations, but stubbornly high shelter costs remain a concern for the Federal Reserve. Corporate earnings have been largely positive, with companies like Goldman Sachs reporting strong results, though others like Abbott Labs saw shares fall despite beating estimates. Overall, the market is navigating a complex environment where positive economic signals are balanced against geopolitical trade risks and the future path of interest rates.

          <p>Author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice often given by billionaires is to "follow your passion." He contends that this advice is typically given by those who are already wealthy and doesn't reflect a practical path to success for most people. Instead, Galloway suggests that individuals should focus on finding something they are good at that also has the potential to be financially lucrative. His own journey involved abandoning a passion for athletics to pursue business, ultimately leading to his success. He emphasizes that enduring rejection and finding the intersection of talent and opportunity is more crucial than blindly following a passion.</p>
