          <p>China has conditionally lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood, which was imposed in 2023 following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The measure allows for the resumption of imports from most Japanese prefectures but maintains the ban on ten, including Tokyo and Fukushima. This decision is viewed as a significant step in resetting strained diplomatic and trade relations between the two East Asian nations, occurring amidst broader global trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax just one day before it was set to take effect, following a threat from President Trump to terminate all trade talks. The 3% levy would have retroactively targeted the revenue of large technology companies like Google and Meta. Ottawa's reversal is intended to de-escalate the trade dispute and support the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security agreement with the United States.

          <p>British automakers are resuming large-scale vehicle shipments to the United States as a new trade deal reduces a punitive 25% tariff down to 10%. The move is expected to unleash pent-up demand for brands like Aston Martin and Range Rover, which had paused exports due to the high levy. However, the deal has drawn sharp criticism from the UK's National Farmers' Union, which argues that British agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure concessions for the car industry.

          <p>New research suggests that passengers are more likely to experience motion sickness in electric vehicles compared to conventional combustion engine cars. Scientists attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the low-frequency movements produced by regenerative braking systems. As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to grow rapidly worldwide, this issue of passenger comfort and its potential health effects is gaining increased attention from automotive engineers.</p>
