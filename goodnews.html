          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by ongoing trade talks with the U.S., bucking broader losses across other Asian markets. The Kospi touched an intraday high of 3,794.87, showcasing strong investor confidence despite global concerns over the banking sector and intensifying trade tensions elsewhere. While other regional indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced declines, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports also rebounded sharply. This positive performance in South Korea suggests unique regional market strength and optimism regarding its specific economic dialogues, contrasting with the wider cautious sentiment in Asia.</p>

          <p>Former members of the British military can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a significant step expected to benefit about 1.8 million veterans. This optional digital ID, accessible via a smartphone app, aims to simplify access to various public services, including GP and mental health support, supported housing, and careers advice, as well as offering reduced entry prices and shopping discounts. Ministers are positioning this rollout as a "case study" for a planned mandatory UK-wide digital ID scheme for all citizens and residents by 2029. The initiative seeks to modernize public services, reduce red tape, and address privacy concerns, ultimately improving convenience and access for former service personnel.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's existing policy. Administered six times a year, this injection offers a crucial alternative to daily pills for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), enhancing convenience and discretion for vulnerable individuals at high risk of sexually acquired HIV. Experts hope this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's ambition of ending new HIV cases by 2030, particularly benefiting those who find oral PrEP challenging due to access, practicalities, or privacy concerns.

          <p>The article explores a cultural shift towards openly discussing sweat and other bodily functions, moving away from long-standing taboos. Triggered by public figures like Alan Carr on "The Traitors" and celebrities such as Adele and Chrissy Teigen sharing their experiences, perspiration is becoming normalized. This trend extends to professional settings, with "sauna diplomacy" gaining traction, and the beauty industry promoting a "sweaty makeup" look. While some view this as positive body positivity, others, like chemist Sarah Everts, are skeptical, suggesting it's also a marketing strategy. The article also touches on the medical condition hyperhidrosis and the evolutionary benefits of sweating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, citing a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment. The three-judge panel found insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" against the U.S. government's authority or that federal forces were unable to execute laws, explicitly stating that "political opposition is not rebellion." This decision maintains the block on deploying federalized Guardsmen within Illinois, despite President Trump's claims they are needed for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect federal immigration facilities. The article underscores the court's rejection of the administration's legal justification, highlighting the judiciary's role in checking executive power.</p>

          <p>Dazzling satellite photos reveal California's dramatic transformation after the season's first major snowstorms brought much-needed precipitation. Images captured before and after the storm show parched brown mountain peaks replaced by brilliant white snow and reservoirs replenished with rain across California, extending into Nevada and Utah. This deluge has left most of California's largest reservoirs at or above historical levels for this time of year, significantly delaying the fire season in Los Angeles for weeks, if not months. Experts from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography highlight the positive impact of this "weak atmospheric river" in helping the state recover from drought and starting the water year on a favorable foot.</p>
