          <p>A 54-pound Martian meteorite, the largest piece of Mars known to exist on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's and is expected to fetch up to $4 million. Discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023, the meteorite, designated NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only 0.6% of all meteorites found. The rock was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before traveling 140 million miles to Earth, offering a significant dataset for scientific study.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding devastated their South Dakota farm, the Oberg family is rebuilding their lives, having constructed a new home on a man-made hill. Lacking flood insurance, they used their savings and sold off farmland to recover from the disaster, which saw nearly a year's worth of rain fall in two months. The event highlights the growing threat of "whiplash weather" linked to climate change, where extreme precipitation is followed by drought. Despite the emotional and financial toll, local farmers are hopeful as this year's crops appear to be growing as expected.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan President Santiago Peña has declared that his nation will "stand firmly by Taiwan," defending their 68-year diplomatic relationship with all its strength. Speaking at a business forum, Peña framed the alliance as a strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, not merely economic interests. This strong statement follows a recent incident where Paraguay declared a Beijing-based envoy persona non grata for privately urging opposition lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Paraguay remains one of the few countries globally that formally recognizes Taiwan's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>China's growing prowess in drug development was a major highlight at the world's largest cancer research conference, according to a report by Jefferies. Chinese companies were responsible for nearly a third of the presentations, showcasing their advantages in cost-efficiency, accelerated development timelines, and quality. This has led to increased interest from multinational corporations, who are "shopping" for Chinese innovations to partner on. These deals typically grant global firms rights to develop and market the drugs outside of China, while the Chinese discoverers retain domestic rights.</p>

Morgan Stanley echoed this, stating the impact would be negligible for larger fintechs that rely less on direct bank account connections.

The reduction is attributed to initiatives like encampment resolutions and increased funding for housing.

While the government does not plan to reduce the number of branches, it is exploring long-term structural changes, including mutualization or a charter model similar to the BBC.
