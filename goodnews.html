          <p>President Trump announced plans for a news conference to reveal a "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country," although he did not disclose the country's identity. News outlets speculated that the agreement might be with the UK, which would be the first such deal since tariffs were imposed on numerous trading partners. The article notes the uncertainty surrounding whether the announcement will be a finalized deal or just a framework for future negotiations. The BBC has reached out to the White House and the UK's Department for Business & Trade for comment on the reports.</p>
