          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading patterns as investors digested China's latest manufacturing data. The RatingDog manufacturing index indicated expansion at 50.5, contrasting with a previous contraction. Simultaneously, developments in India-China relations were under scrutiny, with leaders emphasizing partnership over rivalry during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index experienced a rise, fueled by gains in Alibaba Group and other major stocks, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index saw declines. Optimism in the markets remains tempered by global economic uncertainties. </p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, driven by rising new orders and export business recovery. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index hit 50.5, exceeding Reuters' economist estimates. This improvement indicates the fastest expansion rate since March, rebounding from July's contraction, which was partly due to the resilience of external demand. Despite this upturn, some analysts caution against viewing it as a sustained rally, noting that domestic demand remains soft. This report offers a mixed view of China's economic landscape. </p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government evaluates the feasibility of implementing a social media ban for individuals under 16. The ban, scheduled to take effect in December, requires platforms to prevent Australian children from creating accounts. The report examined various age verification methods, including identity documents, parental approval, and facial assessment technology. While technically feasible, each method presents risks and shortcomings, particularly regarding data privacy and accuracy. The Communications Minister emphasized the responsibility of tech companies to use data and technology to ensure children's online safety. </p>

At the summit, leaders are expected to sign a declaration to strengthen security, economic, and cultural cooperation. Xi's announcement of a talent scheme and call for a SCO development bank signal China's commitment to regional growth and cooperation.

          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace," recounts an incident where Queen Camilla fought off an attempted sexual assault as a teenager. The Queen reportedly shared the story with Boris Johnson in 2008, detailing how she used her shoe to defend herself on a train. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account, which aligns with the Queen's ongoing public work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Sources close to the Queen suggest that sharing this story may help destigmatize such experiences. This revelation sheds light on the Queen's personal history and advocacy. </p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong shares, driven by better-than-expected earnings in the June quarter. The company's cloud-computing unit saw accelerated sales, and its e-commerce business continued to recover. Revenue rose 2% year-on-year, and net income increased by 78%, attributed to equity investment gains and the disposal of Trendyol. However, excluding these gains, net income would have decreased by 18% due to investments in instant commerce. The company's cloud computing division experienced a 26% year-on-year revenue increase, fueled by AI demand. </p>

          <p>The Western Australian seafood industry is phasing out expanded polystyrene boxes in favor of a biofoam alternative made from wheat straw. Developed in partnership with the Bioplastics Innovation Hub and Cass Materials, the biofoam shares insulating qualities with polystyrene but lacks its harmful environmental impacts. Polystyrene takes over 500 years to biodegrade and contains carcinogens, while biofoam biodegrades in months and improves soil quality. The new biofoam is in Stage 4 of development, with Cass Materials scaling up manufacturing to meet anticipated demand. This shift reflects growing consumer awareness of plastic's environmental damage. </p>

The group is credited with destroying nearly 500 Japanese planes while sustaining minimal losses. The daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder were invited to a military parade in Beijing, highlighting the enduring bond.

          <p>England has begun the final phase of its largest-ever expansion of publicly funded childcare support. Working parents can now access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time for children aged nine months to four years. Parents are facing long waiting lists, with nurseries warning that staff shortages are limiting availability. A research suggests that workforce issues could be a key barrier to delivering the promised offer to parents, with low pay and limited progression opportunities a constant challenge for staff. The government says the number of staff delivering funded childcare in nurseries rose to 272,500 this year - up by 18,200 from 2024, which it said was the highest increase on record. </p>

High demand, fueled by matcha's reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has strained supplies in Japan.

Japan's Ministry of Finance reports a fourfold increase in green tea exports over the past decade, with the US being a primary destination. The Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to encourage tencha cultivation. </p>
