          <p>This article highlights several independent Latin artists whose innovative work during the 2024-2025 season merits consideration for the upcoming Latin Grammy Awards. It argues that while major commercial acts often dominate the nominations, many progressive and forward-thinking musicians operate outside the mainstream. The piece profiles six specific artists, including Juana Aguirre, Gepe, and Mabe Fratti, detailing their unique sounds and creative contributions. The author suggests these artists are pushing the boundaries of Latin music and should be celebrated for their artistic achievements by the Latin Academy.</p>

          <h2>Kamala Harris Declines to Run for California Governor, Leaving 2028 Presidential Bid a Possibility</h2>

          <p>Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026, a decision that opens up the crowded field for the state's top office. By forgoing the gubernatorial race, she keeps the door open for a potential third run for the presidency in 2028. A campaign for governor would have made a simultaneous presidential bid practically and politically difficult. In her statement, Harris did not rule out future public service, and allies suggest she will remain a prominent voice in the Democratic party and may explore other avenues for impact outside of elected office for now.</p>

          <h2>Arm Holdings Shares Decline After First-Quarter Revenue Falls Slightly Short of Expectations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of chip technology firm Arm Holdings fell in after-hours trading after the company reported its first-quarter financial results. While its earnings per share met analyst predictions, its revenue of $1.05 billion was just shy of the $1.06 billion consensus estimate. The company, which provides the architecture for chips used in billions of devices, including those from Apple and Qualcomm, gave a second-quarter revenue forecast that was in line with Wall Street's expectations. The slight revenue miss was enough to cause a negative reaction from investors in a high-expectation market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Donald Trump to implement cuts. The central bank is maintaining its cautious stance to combat inflation, which recently crept up to 2.7%, still above the Fed's 2% target. Economists note that the economy's continued strength, including solid GDP growth and a robust labor market, supports the Fed's decision to keep borrowing costs high for now. Despite the hold, investors still anticipate at least one rate cut later in the year, depending on future economic data.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of a five-day strike by resident doctors in England, the British Medical Association (BMA) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have agreed to restart negotiations. The latest walkout, the twelfth since the dispute began, occurred after previous talks broke down. Streeting stated he is willing to discuss working conditions but not to renegotiate the recent pay offer, warning that the union had lost government goodwill due to the strike. The BMA expressed hope for a tangible settlement offer as they prepare to return to the negotiating table early next week.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has voted to advance a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in an 8-7 vote to move the legislation forward. The bill, now called the Honest Act, would require lawmakers to divest their holdings and certify compliance annually. Despite clearing the committee, the bill's future is uncertain as it is not yet clear if it will receive a full vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

The child, who will be reunited with family, has spent their entire life in the camp, which is known for its poor living conditions and violence. The U.S. continues to urge other nations to repatriate their own citizens from the camps, stating it is the only viable long-term solution to the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis.

          <p>The wildfire relief organization FireAid has retained the law firm Latham & Watkins to conduct a review of its governance and grantmaking procedures. This move comes after the charity, which raised $100 million for victims of Southern California fires, faced misleading criticism from President Trump and other right-wing politicians. Despite publishing detailed reports on its fund distribution to non-profits, FireAid has been accused of a lack of transparency. The organization is taking this step to affirm the integrity of its process and ensure funds are being used as intended for community relief.</p>
