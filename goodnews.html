          <h2>New Jersey Lawmaker Proposes Renaming Delaware Bay to "The Bay of New Jersey"</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal appears inspired by President Trump's order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Testa, who represents a district bordering the bay, argues that New Jersey's robust fishing and tourism industries warrant the name change, stating it's time to "Make New Jersey Great Again." The bay has been named for its southern neighbor since 1610, and the proposal would require state agencies to update all official materials to reflect the new designation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent hostilities between Iran and Israel, a debate has emerged among officials, journalists, and historians on how to label the conflict, with President Trump suggesting the name "12-Day War." Experts note that official names for wars are often not the ones that stick, pointing to historical examples like the "Gulf War." Military historians question whether the recent flare-up even constitutes a formal war, viewing it as an escalation of a long-standing shadow conflict. The article also dismisses the "World War III" moniker, with specialists arguing that current global conflicts lack the scale and interconnectedness of past world wars.</p>

          <p>Scotland's Sione Tuipulotu believes he is returning to his best form after playing a full match for the British and Irish Lions in their victory over Western Force. Having missed the Six Nations due to injury, the center feels he is regaining the power and influence that made him a top contender for the Lions Test team. Tuipulotu praised his midfield partner Garry Ringrose's physical performance and expressed enjoyment playing alongside him. He also highlighted the impact of fly-half Finn Russell, whose instinctive style, combined with the team's structure, creates a dynamic and challenging offense for opponents.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase transparency, NPR has detailed its internal guidelines for using anonymous sources in its reporting. The organization states a strong preference for on-the-record sources but acknowledges that anonymity is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from significant harm, such as job loss or legal jeopardy, when they provide vital information. Before granting anonymity, senior editors conduct a rigorous vetting process to assess the source's credibility, the importance of their information, and the potential risks they face. When an unnamed source is used, NPR commits to explaining the reason for the anonymity to its audience.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared hesitant and defensive, throwing few punches for most of the contest. The performance drew boos from the crowd, but Paul celebrated what he called an "easy work" victory over a seasoned opponent. The win continues to fuel debate over Paul's legitimacy in professional boxing, as critics point to his selection of aging or unmotivated fighters, while Paul himself calls for a title shot.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to build a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move is part of the EU's push for technological sovereignty, treating Eutelsat as a strategic asset for secure communications. However, industry experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, pointing to its vastly larger satellite constellation, manufacturing capacity, and launch access. While Eutelsat may succeed in niche government and enterprise markets, achieving mass-market parity with its American rival appears to be a long shot. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban covering many public outdoor spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The rules, which took effect Sunday, are part of a national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to protect children from secondhand smoke. The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants. With over 30% of French adults still smoking, the government hopes these new restrictions, along with high taxes on cigarettes, will further reduce the country's smoking rate, which remains one of the highest in Europe.</p>
