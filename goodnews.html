          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud, according to a video posted by Trump's communications advisor. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, stated she received a call from Trump informing her of the decision and that she and her brother were personally informed by Trump. The Chrisleys, known for "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution after being found guilty of engaging in a "fifteen-year fraud spree," according to prosecutors. The pardon came as a surprise to Savannah Chrisley, who had lost hope, and she expressed gratitude to Trump and his team.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem advocated for Karol Nawrocki to become the next president of Poland at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Warsaw, criticizing his opponent and "weak" European leaders. Noem argued that Nawrocki would protect Poland's borders and align with President Donald Trump's policies, ensuring continued U.S. support and a military presence. She also claimed that America "lived through four years of hell" under President Biden, citing dangerous criminals and terrorists entering the country. Noem praised Trump for making America safer and encouraged Poland to elect a leader who would work with him for the security of both nations.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, while crews are also battling fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, and all Minnesota evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day, with the fires now covering about 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused," and interactive maps are being regularly updated by the National Interagency Fire Center.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down an executive order from the Trump administration that sought to sanction the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former Republican president George H.W. Bush, stated that an independent judiciary and bar are essential to the American system of justice. This marks the third time this month that a federal judge has rejected Trump's law firm executive orders. The order against WilmerHale cited the firm's previous employment of Robert Mueller, who led an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.</p>
