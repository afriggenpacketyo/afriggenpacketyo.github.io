          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her paedophile father has voiced their disappointment with the government's amendment to the Victims and Courts Bill. The amendment removes parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. The family had to spend over ¬£30,000 in legal fees to achieve this protection. Harriet Harman had introduced an amendment to automatically remove parental responsibility after a conviction for serious child sex offences, but the current legislation falls short of this broader protection.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a renowned Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, has died at the age of 98. Grigorovich's productions, including "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet," significantly influenced Soviet ballet, and he was celebrated for revitalizing male dance roles. His career at the Bolshoi ended in 1995 amidst disputes over contracts, which led to the first-ever dancers' strike at the theatre. His most famous work is considered to be The Stone Flower, which accompanied a series of folk tales composed by Sergei Prokofiev.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek, known as the "Queen of Clay" for her dominance at the French Open, enters the 2025 tournament as a three-time defending champion. However, doubts surround her ability to continue her reign, as she has not won a WTA tournament in the first five months of the season, a first since 2020. As a result, Swiatek has dropped to fifth in the rankings, raising questions about whether she can secure another title at Roland Garros. Swiatek is a former long-time world number one, and this is the first time since 2020 that she has entered the tournament without winning a WTA tournament.</p>
