          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to purchase wireless spectrum licenses from the company for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash transaction. This deal, expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval, will significantly enhance AT&T's network by adding about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum across over 400 US markets. EchoStar stated the transaction helps address Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout and spectrum utilization, which had drawn complaints from Elon Musk's SpaceX. The agreement also expands a network services partnership, allowing EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge, appointed by Donald Trump, has dismissed the Department of Justice's lawsuit against the entire Maryland federal judiciary concerning a standing order that temporarily halts migrant deportations after legal challenges. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen vehemently criticized the Trump administration's "unprecedented and unfortunate" attacks on federal judges, deeming the lawsuit a "nonjusticiable dispute" between co-equal government branches. Cullen ruled that the judges are "absolutely immune" from such legal action, emphasizing that the Executive Branch must pursue appropriate legal avenues for its grievances. This decision upholds judicial independence against what was seen as a confrontational and improper challenge to court authority.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt and high interest rates weighing on households, many are seeking effective strategies to manage or eliminate their balances. This article compares three primary tools: balance transfer credit cards, personal loans, and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), each offering distinct mechanics, costs, and risks. Balance transfers provide a temporary 0% interest period but incur fees and require good credit, while personal loans offer fixed payments and an end date, albeit with potentially higher rates. HELOCs leverage home equity for lower rates and higher limits but put one's home at risk. The optimal choice depends on individual credit scores, debt amount, and repayment timelines.

          <p>The current housing market presents significant challenges with high home prices and mortgage interest rates, which stand at an average of 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Experts are cautiously optimistic about a potential downward trend in mortgage rates for fall 2025, though a Federal Reserve rate cut in September might not cause an immediate, substantial drop. Mortgage rates are primarily influenced by the bond market rather than directly by the federal funds rate. Analysts project rates could approach the 6% mark by year-end, a psychological barrier that could stimulate buyer demand, potentially leading to increased competition and higher home prices.

          <p>With the stock market at record highs, many investors hold significant profits in taxable accounts, potentially facing capital gains taxes upon selling. This article highlights that numerous investors may qualify for a 0% capital gains tax rate for assets held over a year, a fact often overlooked. President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" did not alter the capital gains rates but introduced new deductions that could reduce taxable income for 2025, thereby expanding eligibility for the 0% bracket. Notably, a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans (65+) further reduces taxable income, creating a "golden opportunity" for tax-efficient asset sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The debate over whether to keep air conditioning on or off when leaving home is a common one, with experts generally recommending setting the thermostat a few degrees higher. While turning off the AC for several hours typically saves energy and money, it can lead to humidity and mold issues in certain climates, as well as increased wear on the unit when restarting. Adjusting the thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit for eight hours can save up to 10% on cooling costs. Factors like climate (humid vs. dry), home insulation, and AC unit type influence the optimal strategy, with smart thermostats offering an automated solution.</p>

As a needle-free alternative to current GLP-1 injections, this oral option could boost supply and access, offering convenience without dietary restrictions.

Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing owner, notes a "fall-off at the top and the bottom" as students and parents prioritize cost savings over high-end features like golf simulators. There's an accelerating investment trend towards large, flagship public universities, which continue to see record enrollment growth and unmet housing needs.

          <p>UK budget retailer Poundland has successfully averted administration after a High Court approved its turnaround plan, just days before it was projected to run out of cash. The rescue deal, which includes a "very significant" £90 million cash injection from private equity firm Gordon Brothers, will stabilize the business and restructure its £276.5 million loan repayments. Despite the positive outcome, the plan still involves the closure of 68 stores and two distribution sites, impacting around 1,000 jobs, as the company streamlines operations. Poundland aims to return to growth by revamping ranges and lowering prices, focusing on a simpler, more customer-focused model. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond milk, other dairy items like yogurt and cheese, along with calcium-fortified non-dairy milks, fruit juices, and cereals, are excellent options. Registered dietitians also recommend canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, and various vegetables including kale, broccoli, and bok choy. While a colorful and balanced diet typically suffices, those concerned about nutrient shortfalls, especially women or plant-based eaters, should consult a doctor about supplements.</p>
