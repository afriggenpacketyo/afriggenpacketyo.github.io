          <p>GE Vernova has announced a $41 million investment to expand its generator manufacturing operations at its Schenectady, New York facility. This move aims to increase production capacity for its heavy-duty gas turbines, which are in high demand due to the significant energy consumption of new AI data centers. The investment is expected to create 50 new jobs and help alleviate supply constraints, as the company's gas turbines are reportedly sold out for the next several years. This expansion addresses the urgent need for more power-generating capacity to support the ongoing AI infrastructure boom. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline is accompanied by a significant shift in public perception, with a record 53% of adults now believing that even moderate drinking is detrimental to health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. The trend is most pronounced among young adults, who are increasingly skeptical of alcohol's purported benefits and are drinking less frequently. This change reflects a growing awareness of health risks, such as cancer, associated with alcohol consumption.</p>

          <p>Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has announced that the upcoming US Open will be her final tournament before retiring from professional tennis at the age of 35. Reflecting on her career, Kvitova expressed contentment with her achievements, which include 31 titles and a career-high ranking of world No. 2. She acknowledged that a horrific knife attack in 2016, which severely injured her playing hand, marked the beginning of a 'second career' and required immense mental fortitude to overcome. Kvitova, who recently became a mother, cited the physical and emotional demands of the tour as key factors in her decision to retire.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOC rates are variable and typically tied to the prime rate, a cut in the federal funds rate usually translates to lower interest charges. However, experts caution that the timing of this relief depends on the lender's adjustment schedule, which can be immediate, monthly, or quarterly. Homeowners are advised to understand their specific loan terms, including any introductory rates or rate floors, to accurately predict how their payments will be affected. (not investment advice)</p>
