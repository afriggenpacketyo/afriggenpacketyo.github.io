          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have finalized a comprehensive deal aimed at improving their relationship following Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. The agreement encompasses various sectors including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with officials from both sides expressing optimism about this "historic day" and the beginning of a "new chapter." The British government projects that the deal will bolster businesses, create jobs, reduce food costs, cut bureaucratic processes, improve access to the EU market, and potentially add ¬£9 billion to the UK economy by 2040. The agreement also includes a new Security and Defence Partnership, extended fishing rights for EU trawlers, and easier travel for British citizens and their pets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is implementing new regulations to oversee the burgeoning "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) industry, addressing concerns about potential consumer debt traps. These rules will require BNPL firms, such as Klarna and Afterpay, to conduct thorough upfront checks to ensure consumers can afford repayments. The new regulations will also streamline the refund process and allow consumers to escalate complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. City Minister Emma Reynolds emphasized that these measures aim to provide both consumer protection and the necessary certainty for the sector's investment and job creation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills for domestic customers in the UK will decrease by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This reduction of nearly 7% will bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. While this decrease is a welcome development for households, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many. The energy price cap covers approximately 22 million households in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p>

          <p>Smartex, a tech company founded by Gilberto Loureiro, is revolutionizing the textile industry by using cameras, vision software, and AI to detect defects in fabrics during production, thus reducing waste. The company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. The fashion industry has a significant waste problem, with about a truckload of clothes thrown away every second. Smartex has attracted investments from H&M Group, Tony Fadell (inventor of the iPod), and Amazon through its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship, highlighting the potential for technology to improve efficiency and sustainability in apparel production.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm plans to launch data center processors designed to power artificial intelligence, which will link to Nvidia's chips. This marks Qualcomm's re-entry into the data center market after previous unsuccessful attempts. The new custom CPU will connect to Nvidia's GPUs and software, a crucial link given Nvidia's dominance in AI-related semiconductors. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, which designs processors based on Arm designs, to bolster its efforts with data center CPUs. This move is part of Qualcomm's broader strategy to diversify its business beyond smartphones, as Apple and other players develop their own modems and processors.</p>

NVLink Fusion will allow customers and partners to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's products and NVLink technology. This program includes AI chipmaking partners such as MediaTek, Marvell, and others, and will enable customers like Fujitsu and Qualcomm Technologies to connect their own third-party CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers. The NVLink represents Nvidia's plans to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, which have traditionally been seen as Nvidia competitors.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland have shown a halt, or at least a slowdown, in the rise of hard-right movements, though discontent with established political parties persists. In Romania, centrist mayor Nicusor Dan defeated a hard-line nationalist, George Simion, in a runoff election, confounding expectations of a sharp turn to the right. Poland's election saw liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski come in first, securing a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, though the margin of victory was small, indicating strong support for hard-right candidates. The outcome reflects a broader trend of fragmentation and a move away from traditional political allegiances in Eastern Europe.</p>
