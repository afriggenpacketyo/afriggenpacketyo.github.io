        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, especially Gen Zers who rely on instant answers. Studies show that the use of jargon often correlates with feelings of lower status within a company, especially when employees feel they are being 'layered' or undermined by superiors. The article suggests that buzzwords are a distraction from the primary goal of making money and encourages clear, human language in the workplace. Rather than relying on jargon, the author advocates for using real, understandable language in professional settings.</p>

          <p>More than 130 former state and federal judges have filed an amicus brief, condemning the indictment of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan as an "egregious overreach" by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted in April for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest, a charge the former judges argue undermines judicial independence. They assert that judges are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts and that any alleged mistakes should be addressed within the judicial branch, not through criminal prosecution. The group warns that the indictment sets a dangerous precedent that could chill judicial decision-making at every level.</p>
