          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced a partnership with Miral to develop a new Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. This will be Disney's seventh theme park destination, with Disney's Imagineers leading the creative design and operational oversight, but Miral will be fully developing and building the park. While Disney will not be investing capital in the project, it will benefit from royalties, and this project is separate from Disney's $60 billion investment in its theme parks over the next decade. The park's opening date is yet to be determined, but designs are already underway.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed that while earnings per share surpassed expectations, revenue fell slightly short, leading to a drop in company shares. The ride-hailing giant reported a net income increase and growth in its mobility and delivery sectors, with monthly active platform consumers rising to 170 million. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted Uber's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, noting a significant number of autonomous vehicle trips. The company is also facing an FTC lawsuit over its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi dismisses as unfounded, while also requiring employees to return to the office three days a week.</p>

          <p>Far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light that can kill airborne pathogens without harming humans, is emerging as a promising tool for preventing respiratory diseases and pandemics. Recent advancements include the development of cheaper and more efficient solid-state lamps using secondary harmonics, making far-UVC disinfection more accessible. While concerns about ozone production exist, new research suggests that moderate use and ceiling placement of far-UVC lamps can minimize air quality issues. Further research is needed, but the technology could potentially reduce the spread of childhood flus, tuberculosis, and pandemic viruses in the future.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is now enforcing Real ID requirements, meaning that standard state-issued IDs may no longer be accepted at airport security checkpoints. While some states offer enhanced IDs that are compliant, travelers without a Real ID can still use other forms of identification, such as a U.S. passport or military ID. Those without acceptable identification may undergo an identity verification process, but those whose identities cannot be confirmed will not be allowed to pass through security, so travelers should arrive at least three hours before their flight.</p>

Despite TSA assurances that alternative identity checks will be available, many travelers expressed frustration and concern over potential delays. The new requirements, stemming from a 2005 law, mandate a Real ID-compliant license or acceptable alternative for domestic air travel and access to federal facilities, leading to increased demand and long lines at DMVs across the country.</p>
