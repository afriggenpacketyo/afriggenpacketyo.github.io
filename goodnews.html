        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Famed chef Gordon Ramsay has announced his diagnosis with Basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, through a post on his Instagram account. He shared a photo of his face bandaged below the ear, thanking his medical team for the swift removal of the carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck. The 58-year-old chef used his diagnosis as a public service announcement, urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially over the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time after false rumors of his death trended on social media platforms. He was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia, appearing to be in good health. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from his running mate, J.D. Vance, who spoke about being prepared to assume the presidency in the event of a tragedy, raising concerns about Trump's well-being. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing issues like hand bruising to frequent handshaking and a benign venous insufficiency condition.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has submitted an improved £35 million offer for Crystal Palace's central defender, Marc Guehi, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, and talks between the two football clubs are ongoing as the transfer deadline approaches. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely as his current deal expires next summer. Crystal Palace is actively seeking to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's departure to Liverpool before the window closes.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with the condiment company Hela to create a limited-edition beer called 'Currydurst' (Currythirst). This novel beverage infuses a classic Astra beer with the spicy, smoky flavor of Hela's iconic curry ketchup, a staple condiment for Germany's famous Currywurst sausage. The creation is a tribute to Hamburg's vibrant street food culture, combining two local favorites into a single product. With only 2,000 liters being brewed, the special edition beer is a novelty item that plays on consumer taste expectations and local culinary traditions.</p>

          <p>A major auction of over 1,000 Hollywood props and costumes will feature iconic items, including Darth Vader's lightsaber from "Star Wars," which has a presale estimate of $3 million. The event, hosted by Propstore in Los Angeles, will also include Indiana Jones' bullwhip and the cursed medallion from "Pirates of the Caribbean." The authenticity of the items, like the lightsaber which was crafted from a vintage camera flash, has been meticulously vetted by experts. While some items are expected to fetch millions, the auction also offers lower-priced memorabilia starting at $200, allowing a wider range of fans to own a piece of film history.</p>

          <h2>New York City Declares End to Deadly Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak in Harlem</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 13:07:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City health officials have declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the severe pneumonia-like illness.</p>

          <h2>AI-Powered Stethoscope Shows Promise in Rapidly Detecting Heart Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can reportedly detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. The device analyzes subtle differences in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable by the human ear and compares them against a large patient database. A study involving over 12,000 patients in London GP surgeries found that the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential 'game-changer' for enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment, with plans to roll it out further across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the rules and eligibility for Social Security survivor benefits, which are paid to the spouses, ex-spouses, and children of deceased workers who paid into the system. Generally, a surviving spouse must be at least 60 years old, or 50 if disabled, to qualify, though age requirements can be waived if caring for a young or disabled child. The article notes that remarriage before a certain age can affect eligibility and that working while receiving benefits may reduce the payment amount. It advises individuals to contact the Social Security Administration promptly after a spouse's death to understand their options for maximizing their benefits over time. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were revealed due to receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought plaguing the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water in Iraq's largest reservoir to historic lows, allowing archaeological teams to access the previously submerged site. The tombs are thought to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. Researchers are now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is once again submerged by water.</p>
