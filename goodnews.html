          <p>Meta's shares surged over 10% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed revenue expectations, reaching $47.52 billion against a $44.80 billion forecast. Advertising revenue, specifically, exceeded projections at $46.56 billion, attributed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to greater efficiency from Meta's artificial intelligence technology. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast and increased capital expenditure estimates for AI development, signaling continued investment in the sector. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs unit, Meta's overall net income rose significantly, indicating strong financial performance and a positive outlook for future growth, particularly in AI capabilities.

          <p>WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter publicly supported actress Sydney Sweeney following backlash over her American Eagle advertisement, which critics claimed promoted thinness and was akin to "Nazi propaganda." The ad campaign, titled "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," involved Sweeney altering the word "Genes" to "Jeans" on a billboard, sparking widespread online furor. Despite attempts at a "cancel culture" takedown, supporters, including C.J. Pearson, argued the criticism was rooted in Sweeney's appearance rather than the ad's content. The controversy temporarily saw American Eagle's share price rise, highlighting the unusual impact of such public debates on corporate image and market value.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation, including President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," has significantly bolstered the benefits and accessibility of Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts. These tax-advantaged savings accounts enable eligible individuals with disabilities to save and invest without jeopardizing their eligibility for crucial government benefits like Medicaid and Social Security. A key change, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act, will expand eligibility from age 26 to 46 starting in 2026, projected to qualify millions more people. Additionally, the new laws make permanent tax advantages, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans into ABLE accounts, and increasing the annual contribution eligible for the saver's credit, significantly enhancing financial planning for individuals with disabilities.

          <p>An Ohio couple, Lindsey and Tim Pierce, has welcomed a baby boy, Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, born from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, reportedly setting a new world record. This remarkable birth is believed to be the longest an embryo has been cryopreserved before resulting in a successful live birth. The Pierces adopted the embryo through a Christian adoption agency's "Snowflakes" program, which connects donors with recipient families, after trying to conceive for seven years. The original donor, Linda Archerd, created the embryo in 1994 and sought a specific match for its adoption. This case underscores the evolving landscape of reproductive science and the profound personal journeys involved in embryo adoption.</p>

Tributes were delivered by family and notable Conservative figures, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who praised his service to the country. Lord Tebbit was a key ally of Margaret Thatcher, known for his role in implementing legislation to curtail union power in the 1980s. He sustained serious injuries in the 1984 IRA Brighton bombing, which also left his wife permanently paralyzed, and his subsequent decision to leave politics to care for her underscored his deep commitment and devotion.</p>

          <p>The Office for National Statistics has revealed the most popular baby names in England and Wales for 2024, with new entries Athena and Yahya breaking into the top 100. Muhammad maintained its position as the most popular boys' name for the second year running, followed by Noah and Oliver. For girls, Olivia and Amelia continued their reign at the top for a third year, with Lily securing the third spot. Baby name experts observe that while traditional names remain strong, there's a growing inclination among parents for more unique choices, often inspired by popular culture. Additionally, a "100-year rule" sees names popular a century ago, like Arthur, making a comeback, reflecting cyclical trends in naming conventions.</p>

          <p>Following devastating wildfires that destroyed over 16,000 buildings across Los Angeles County, modular homes are emerging as a crucial solution to help survivors rebuild their lives quickly. Steve Gibson, whose home was lost in the Eaton Fire, chose a modular unit from the startup Cover due to the urgent need for speed in reconstruction. These factory-built homes, often designed as accessory dwelling units, significantly reduce the time and complexity typically associated with traditional construction after a disaster. The article showcases how this innovative approach is providing a more efficient and streamlined path for affected residents to re-establish their homes, offering a practical solution in the face of widespread destruction and the challenges of recovery.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan are reportedly discussing scenarios for the potential use of US nuclear weapons in an East Asian contingency, a development aimed at strengthening Washington's nuclear umbrella over Tokyo. This move builds on previous guidelines for extended deterrence adopted by the allies, seeking to enhance communication procedures regarding US nuclear capabilities. Experts suggest this could alleviate Japan's concerns about supporting Taiwan's defense in a potential conflict, but it is expected to provoke a negative reaction from Beijing.

These products leverage substantial average home equity, offering a smart way to borrow large sums. While HELOCs have variable rates and revolving credit, home equity loans offer fixed rates and lump sums.

Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead, and short-term CDs currently offer higher yields due to an inverted yield curve, presenting strategic opportunities for savers.

Key drivers of gold prices include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate movements, which have an inverse relationship with gold. Geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, market sentiment, and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining the precious metal's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has initiated formal investigations into four companies operating 34 porn sites for alleged non-compliance with new age verification requirements. These regulations, which became effective recently, mandate "highly effective" tools to ensure users are over 18, aiming to prevent children from accessing harmful adult content. The regulator prioritized these specific companies due to the significant risk of harm posed by their services and their substantial user numbers, collectively attracting over nine million monthly visitors. This enforcement action is a key component of the broader Online Safety Act, a law that has drawn both support for child protection and criticism regarding privacy concerns and the practical effectiveness of its implementation.</p>

Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan claims to offer reduced risk and avoid the costly and disruptive diversion of the M25 motorway, aiming for full operation by 2035 at an estimated cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time two competing bids for a third runway are on the table, following the government's invitation for proposals.

While some analysts expected superior results, clinicians view the comprehensive benefits as clinically meaningful, potentially solidifying Mounjaro as a preferred treatment option.
