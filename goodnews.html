Over 300 South Korean nationals were among the 475 workers arrested for allegedly working illegally. The White House defended the raid as standard procedure by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), while Seoul is working to arrange a chartered flight for the detainees and improve visa systems to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom are preparing for a total lunar eclipse that will turn the full moon a reddish color, an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility will vary across the UK, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view as the moon rises. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon, noting that no special equipment is needed for safe viewing.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to become the first millennial to be canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to create a website cataloging eucharistic miracles, blending modern technology with traditional faith. His rapid path to sainthood, supported by two Vatican-recognized miracles, has generated significant enthusiasm, turning his tomb in Assisi into a major pilgrimage site for a new generation of Catholics.</p>

His appointment comes after the previous prime minister, Paetongtam Shinawatra, was removed by a court order, disrupting her family's long-standing political influence. Anutin, known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured the position with support from the opposition People's Party on the condition that he will dissolve parliament and call for new elections within four months.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a highly anticipated game against the New York Jets, the team he played for last season. This matchup marks a dramatic return for the 41-year-old veteran to the same stadium where he suffered a season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his Jets career. The game is framed by narratives of fresh starts, as the Jets have also moved on with a new quarterback, Justin Fields, who ironically was with Pittsburgh last season.</p>

          <p>The US Open has transformed from a traditional grand slam tennis tournament into a major cultural event, prioritizing celebrity appearances, influencer marketing, and high-end consumer experiences. This article argues that the event's atmosphere now resembles a music festival like Coachella, with expensive themed cocktails, branded merchandise, and even a courtside dating show becoming central attractions. While attendance is at an all-time high, this shift highlights a broader trend in sports where the spectacle of consumption and social media presence are becoming as important as the athletic competition itself.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a prime suspect in a series of 2003 bombings in California and one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being discovered in Wales. San Diego, who had a $250,000 bounty on his head, evaded capture for 21 years before being arrested last year living under an alias. He is linked to animal rights extremist groups and is indicted for two bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area, with former FBI agents now reflecting on missed opportunities to arrest him before he vanished.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, the 24-year-old founder of the water filtration company Water2, has seen his business grow to an eight-figure valuation within two years of launching. After dropping out of university, Robinson developed a self-installable water filter and used authentic social media videos to connect with customers, leading to rapid success. The brand's profile was significantly boosted when adventurer Bear Grylls, initially a customer, became a co-owner and investor. Robinson credits the company's focused mission and direct-to-consumer approach for its expansion into what he estimates is now 1% of UK homes.</p>

Addressing a crowd of 1,700, both politicians condemned the influence of billionaires in politics and advocated for policies benefiting working-class people. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement and questioned why mainstream Democratic leaders in the state have not fully supported the party's nominee.

          <h2>Scientists Harness Energy from Collapsing Bubbles to Launch Tiny Robots</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 23:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method for launching miniature robots by using the energy released from popping vapor bubbles. The technique involves using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they generate a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects high into the air. This principle, known as cavitation, could offer a new and efficient launching mechanism for small-scale robotics.</p>
