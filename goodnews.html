        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year with temperatures exceeding 33C, accompanied by a Met Office thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England and Wales due to unstable atmospheric conditions. An amber heat-health alert is in effect until Monday, with research suggesting a potential increase in heat-related deaths. Passengers on a Thameslink train in south London were evacuated after a fault caused services to halt, leaving them without power or air conditioning for two hours. The National Fire Chiefs Council urges caution with barbecues and flammable materials, while the Environment Agency monitors water supplies amidst a medium risk of drought. The World Weather Attribution group notes that climate change has significantly increased the likelihood of extreme heat events in June. The optimism score is calculated based on the overall impact of the weather events and their potential consequences. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have committed $1 million to provide direct financial assistance to families of immigrants impacted by recent immigration arrests in the region. This pledge follows a claim by the Dodgers that they denied ICE agents entry to Dodger Stadium, a claim ICE refuted, stating they were never there. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expressed gratitude for the Dodgers' support, emphasizing the city's solidarity during this time. U.S. Customs and Border Protection later clarified that their vehicles were briefly present in the stadium parking lot, unrelated to any enforcement operation. The situation has sparked community concern and debate regarding immigration enforcement practices in the area. </p>

          <p>Ford is reportedly shifting its focus away from engine development, according to a top executive who believes consumers no longer prioritize powertrains. The company may consider outsourcing engine development and manufacturing to suppliers.
