        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Design software company Figma is moving forward with its initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares priced between $25 and $28 each. This pricing could give the company a fully diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion, significantly higher than its 2024 tender offer valuation of $12.5 billion. The IPO follows a collapsed $20 billion acquisition deal by Adobe, which faced regulatory hurdles. Figma's preliminary second-quarter results show continued revenue growth, with sales projected to be up to 41% higher year-over-year, signaling strength in a slow tech IPO market.

          <p>An inspiring article highlights two individuals dedicated to helping others through personal challenges. Brian Flynn, seeking more meaning in his life, became one of the few people in the world to be a double living organ donor, donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy. Separately, teenager Rachel Bee, after being diagnosed with Crohn's disease, invented "Infusion Hero," a specialized sweatshirt with a zippered sleeve to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both stories showcase how personal experiences can be transformed into powerful acts of compassion and innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has warned that the future of public service broadcasting is at risk if younger audiences do not engage with its content. The watchdog is urging YouTube to give more prominence to videos from channels like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 to help tackle this threat. Ofcom's report noted that children spend significantly more time on YouTube than on all public service broadcasters combined. The regulator has proposed a six-point plan, which includes a recommendation that the government consider legislation to ensure such content is easy to find on major streaming platforms.</p>

Originally from Korea, Yoo learned to cook from his mother and grandmother before moving to the U.S. and training under James Beard Award-winning chef Gavin Kaysen. Instead of purely traditional Korean food, Yoo's concept is a fusion that incorporates what he has learned throughout his culinary career, with signature items like a Korean-style fried chicken sandwich and a non-traditional "kimchi-slaw."

Fitzpatrick takes the helm during a challenging period for the fast-food industry, as consumers cut back on dining out and seek value. Subway, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by store count, has faced declining sales and market share erosion amid stiff competition from other sandwich and fast-casual brands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misconception about filing for a federal tax extension. While requesting an extension from the IRS grants an additional six months to submit tax return paperwork, it does not postpone the deadline for payment. Taxpayers are still required to estimate their tax liability and pay what they owe by the original April 15 deadline to avoid late payment penalties and interest charges. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers several options, including installment agreements and, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise to settle the debt for a lesser amount.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered the wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk during World War One, 109 years after it was torpedoed by a German submarine. The ship was found 60 miles off the coast of Scotland at a depth of 82 meters by ProjectXplore, an international shipwreck-hunting project. Thirty-eight crew members were killed in the 1916 attack, but the ship's final resting place remained a mystery despite numerous search attempts. Divers positively identified the wreck by its dimensions, equipment, and an embossed "Nottingham" name stamp found on the stern.</p>

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis grounds can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected by covenants requiring it to be kept open for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority had properly exercised its judgment in approving the plans, which the club says will also deliver newly accessible parkland.</p>

          <p>Following the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime, millions of Syrian refugees, particularly the nearly 3 million residing in Turkey, are facing the complex question of whether to return home. While the end of the authoritarian government brings a stir of hope, the country remains fraught with challenges, including a devastated infrastructure, a shattered economy, and a fragile security situation under an interim government. For many, the decision involves a profound leap of faith, weighing the deep-seated desire to go home against the immense risks of rebuilding a life in a country they may no longer recognize.</p>
