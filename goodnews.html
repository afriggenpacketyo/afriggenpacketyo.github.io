          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson secured a victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter showdown since the Paris Olympics. The race, held at the Silesia Diamond League meet, saw Thompson clock a meet record of 9.87 seconds. Lyles finished a close second with a time of 9.90 seconds, followed by fellow American Kenny Bednarek. This event marked a measure of redemption for Thompson, who had narrowly lost to Lyles for the Olympic gold by a margin of just five-thousandths of a second.</p>

His statement came in response to attacks from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who accused a top Kennedy aide of laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and the administration's "make America healthy again" agenda. He characterized the accusations as an attempt by the "swamp" to create a divide between him and the president.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A prominent academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to expedite its development of space-based solar power technology. Ge Changchun argued for a top-down national strategy to close the technological gap with the United States in this emerging field. Space solar power involves orbiting stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The article notes that China's current research efforts are fragmented across universities and lack the capacity for such a large-scale systems project.</p>

          <p>A series of articles examines the modern trend of intensive parenting, highlighting its exhausting nature for adults and potential harm to children's development. It contrasts this with the "Lighthouse Parent" model, where parents act as steady, reliable guides without controlling every aspect of a child's journey. This approach encourages parents to resist the instinct to immediately solve their children's problems, allowing them to build confidence and resilience by navigating struggles on their own. The articles argue that stepping back is often the most beneficial action a parent can take.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he had placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering. The forfeiture order, which was not opposed by Tate or his brother, adds to the £2.7 million previously seized from the brothers by the same police force in December 2024. Authorities stated the money came from a cryptocurrency account funded by the Tates' untaxed business activities.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping former foster youth in California transition to college life by providing them with essential supplies for their dorm rooms. Many students arriving from the foster system come with minimal belongings and are often unaware of what they will need, from bedding to basic cleaning supplies. The initiative, which started with a small Amazon wishlist, now supports over 140 students, allowing them to choose their own items to personalize their new living space. The program aims to level the playing field, helping these students feel more prepared and equal to their peers.</p>

          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar emphasizes that the most crucial part of her morning routine is simply waking up on time, no matter what. As a self-described recovering perfectionist prone to anxiety, she finds that getting up early provides her with essential time for herself before the day's demands begin. Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog. This approach prevents her from feeling rushed or starting the day with a sense of failure, allowing her to ground herself and generate creativity.</p>

The first step is to visualize learning as a winding path, not a straight line, to better tolerate the frustration of the process. The second involves engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult feelings and build mental strength. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body and mind to tolerate discomfort.</p>
