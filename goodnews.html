          <p>Japanese sprinter Abdul Hakim Sani Brown voiced his anticipation for the world athletics championships in Tokyo this September, highlighting his dream of running in a full National Stadium. The stadium, which served as the main venue for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, was previously closed to general spectators due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sani Brown, a two-time finalist in the 100 meters at the world championships, shared his sentiments during a visit to a Tokyo elementary school, where he conducted an athletics clinic alongside Canadian athlete Andre De Grasse.

          <p>Microsoft has proposed to the European Commission to sell its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites without the Teams workplace communication app in an effort to resolve antitrust concerns. The European Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's practice of bundling Teams with its popular productivity tools after a legal challenge by Slack, which alleges abuse of market power. Microsoft's commitments include offering versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at a reduced price, allowing customers to switch to tools without Teams, and increasing interoperability for Teams' competitors. Salesforce, which acquired Slack, stated it would carefully examine Microsoft's proposed commitments.</p>

          <p>During his visit to Abu Dhabi, US President Donald Trump expressed cautious optimism about reaching a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Trump stated that Iran had "sort of agreed to the terms" and that the US was engaged in "very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace." Despite this optimism, Iran has publicly maintained its stance of continuing uranium enrichment. The UN's nuclear watchdog has assessed that Iran's uranium enrichment capacity is rapidly approaching the level required to produce a nuclear weapon.</p>

Goldman Sachs was a lead underwriter for both of these recent financial technology deals. While uncertainty surrounding presidential trade policies had previously weighed on IPO activity, easing trade tensions have emboldened companies to go public, according to experts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that appealing your property taxes may secure 'several years of savings.' A tax assessment determines the value of your property for tax purposes, but it is not uncommon for properties to be over-assessed due to inaccuracies. To appeal, homeowners should first check the accuracy of their assessment, compare their property to neighbors' homes, and see if they qualify for tax exemptions. If you plan to appeal your taxes, your goal is to demonstrate how the assessor is incorrectly applying the assessment formula to your house. </p>

          <p>Millions more adults in England and Wales are now counted as domestic abuse victims after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) broadened its definition to include controlling and coercive behavior. This change means over 12 million people are believed to have experienced domestic abuse since age 16, up from 10 million previously. The new data reveals that 18% of adults have suffered emotional abuse and 12% economic abuse. A report from MPs calls for better data on violence against women and girls (VAWG) to improve support services and reduce violence.</p>
