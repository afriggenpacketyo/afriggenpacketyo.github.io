          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to release orders from its final "cleanup conference" before its summer recess, with potential rulings on several significant matters. Among the outstanding issues are five emergency petitions involving former President Donald Trump, including cases related to federal workforce reductions, a Florida immigration law, and the deportation of an individual to Ecuador. Court observers anticipate detailed writings from the justices, such as dissents or concurrences, on these cases which were handled without oral arguments. The release follows recent rulings on birthright citizenship and transgender healthcare, with further implications expected from this final session.</p>

Commissioned in 2019, the 70,000-tonne carrier is a key asset for the People's Liberation Army Navy's Southern Theatre Command, primarily operating in the South China Sea. As the nation's second carrier, following the retrofitted Liaoning, the Shandong represents a significant step in China's military modernization and its goal of developing a blue-water navy. The vessel's presence underscores China's strategy to project power beyond the first island chain in the Western Pacific.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has been controversially called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia as an injury replacement. The decision, made by his father and team coach Andy Farrell, marks a surprising return to Test rugby for the 33-year-old, who has not played internationally in nearly two years. Farrell's selection has drawn criticism as he has been inactive for nine weeks due to a concussion and was chosen over other match-fit contenders. Despite the controversy, his experience as a three-time Lions tourist is expected to add leadership to the squad.</p>

          <p>Fans of the singer Lorde are reporting that the CD version of her new album, "Virgin," is unplayable in some standard CD players. The album was released on a transparent disc, which fans speculate may be causing issues with the lasers used by players to read data. While some have found success playing it on devices like a PlayStation, many have expressed frustration online about purchasing a product that doesn't work as expected. The record label, Universal Music Group, has reportedly offered returns to affected customers, but fans are hoping for a new pressing on a standard, functional CD.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Hugh Hewitt argues that House Freedom Caucus members who oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" are risking a catastrophic economic outcome. He contends that blocking the bill would lead to the largest tax hike in history when current cuts expire, damage military readiness, and derail the GOP's agenda. Hewitt dismisses the idea of achieving a better bill later as unrealistic given the narrow political margins. He proposes that holdouts should be offered control of a second, more difficult reconciliation bill focused on entitlement reform, challenging them to produce substantive cuts rather than just performative opposition.

The suggestion comes amid concerns in Beijing that the United States could leverage dollar-backed stablecoins to reinforce the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global finance.

          <p>For individuals without diabetes, experiencing sharp dips in blood sugar after meals can lead to fatigue, mood changes, and increased hunger, potentially hindering weight loss. Scientists identify these individuals as "dippers," whose blood sugar crashes below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbohydrates. To prevent these fluctuations, nutritionists recommend several strategies, including never eating carbohydrates alone and instead pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Additionally, they suggest eating protein and fiber first during a meal, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day, and paying attention to how you feel two hours after eating to identify problematic patterns.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport, which suffered from extensive flight delays and cancellations earlier this year, is showing significant signs of improvement. In June, Newark reportedly became the most reliable airport in the New York City area, a notable turnaround attributed to the completion of runway construction and better-functioning air traffic control systems. Despite the recent positive trend, many frequent travelers remain wary due to past experiences of severe disruptions that caused some to cancel trips or use other airports. The upcoming July Fourth holiday travel rush will be a major test for the airport's fragile recovery and the nation's air travel system.</p>

The deal also addresses the issue of "transshipment," where goods from third countries like China are routed through Vietnam to evade tariffs; Trump stated these shipments would face a 40% levy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by dark surfaces like asphalt and concrete absorbing heat, tall buildings trapping warm air, and a lack of cooling vegetation. The temperature difference can be as much as 15 degrees Celsius, posing health risks. Solutions to mitigate this effect include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements that enhance water evaporation. Cities like New York, Tokyo, and Singapore are implementing these strategies.</p>

          <p>A new study combining genetic and archaeological data has traced the origins of Uralic languages, spoken today by about 25 million people in countries like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary. Researchers found a distinct Siberian genetic ancestry that connects modern Uralic speakers to ancient populations who migrated across Eurasia between 11,000 and 4,000 years ago. The study supports the theory that the Ural Mountains region is the ancestral homeland for these languages. The migrations spread not only language but also technological advancements like metallurgy, influencing the cultures of the regions they settled, including early Indo-European populations in the Baltic.</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include ten nations and now represents a significant non-Western geopolitical and economic force. The group accounts for over 40% of the world's population and more than a third of global GDP, challenging the dominance of Western-led institutions like the World Bank and IMF. BRICS has established its own development bank and is exploring ways to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar through trade in local currencies. While internal divisions and competing national interests pose challenges, the bloc continues to attract interest from dozens of other nations seeking membership. (not investment advice)</p>
