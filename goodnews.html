          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship with a 5-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, marking the NHL's first repeat win since 2021. Sam Reinhart's impressive four-goal performance led the Panthers, while Matthew Tkachuk sealed the win with the Cup-clinching goal. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky's solid performance and key additions to the team contributed to their success. The Panthers' dominant playoff run has sparked discussions of a potential dynasty, as they have won 11 of 12 playoff series since Tkachuk joined the team.</p>

          <p>The G7 leaders have initiated an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, particularly those stemming from over-reliance on China. The strategy involves increased cooperation among G7 nations and aligned countries to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices. The plan includes monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. While the plan avoids directly naming China, it addresses concerns about China's dominance in rare earths and its history of using export controls.</p>

          <p>Inter Milan is experiencing the pressures of an increasingly packed schedule due to the FIFA Club World Cup, which has expanded and complicated the season for players. Despite recent changes in management and travel complications, the team opened the tournament with a draw against Monterrey. The expanded Club World Cup, with its lucrative prize money, adds to the strain on players who could potentially play over 70 games in a single season. Calls for a serious dialogue between FIFA, UEFA, leagues, clubs, and players are growing to address the health and workload concerns.</p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global influence, according to People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This measure is part of a broader effort to promote the yuan's overseas adoption and strengthen Shanghai's position as a global financial hub. The initiative comes amid increasing tensions with the United States over trade and technology. Trials will include refinancing schemes for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.</p>

The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with higher pay for those with more experience. This surge in pay highlights a significant talent shortage in the industry.
