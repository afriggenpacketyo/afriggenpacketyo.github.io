          <p>Shares in both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance experienced a significant surge following reports that Paramount is preparing a buyout offer for its rival. The potential bid for the entirety of Warner Bros.

          <p>Newcastle United has officially signed forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford in a £55 million deal, concluding a transfer saga in which the player publicly expressed his desire to leave. The article highlights Wissa's personal resilience, referencing a 2021 acid attack that nearly ended his career, and his impressive on-field development into a prolific Premier League goalscorer. While his public push for the move has soured his relationship with some Brentford supporters, Newcastle has secured a player they believe can make an immediate impact.</p>

          <p>A potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount Skydance would forge a media giant with an unparalleled collection of content and sports rights. The deal would unite Paramount's franchises, such as "Star Trek" and "Paw Patrol," with Warner's iconic intellectual property, including the DC Universe, "Harry Potter," and "Game of Thrones." Furthermore, the merger would significantly bolster Paramount's sports portfolio, adding Warner's rights to the NHL, March Madness, and MLB games to its existing exclusive deal with the UFC.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a strange turn of events during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, where he believes his golf ball was stolen by spectators. After hitting an errant tee shot just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found, and witnesses reported seeing two people run off with it. The situation allowed him to take a penalty drop upon resuming play, which he said was a "good result" that likely saved him at least one stroke and helped him achieve a strong six-under-par score.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has completed a loan move to Turkish club Trabzonspor for the rest of the 2025-26 season. The transfer occurred just before the Turkish transfer window closed. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the club's starting goalkeeper, had not featured in any of United's first three Premier League matches this season. His only appearance for the team this year was in a surprising Carabao Cup defeat, signaling he was not in the new manager's immediate plans.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have declined to 6.35%, marking their lowest level in nearly a year and presenting a potential window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. This downward trend is largely attributed to market expectations of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a corresponding drop in the 10-year Treasury yield. The article suggests that while waiting for even lower rates is a gamble, the current climate is favorable enough to warrant exploring mortgage options now. (not investment advice)</p>
