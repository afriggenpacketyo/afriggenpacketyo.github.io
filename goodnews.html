          <p>The United States and China have reached a surprising agreement to slash tariffs on each other's imports for 90 days, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. This agreement, reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva, has prompted a surge in stock prices and optimism about a resolution to the trade dispute, although the long-term implications remain uncertain. The deal provides a temporary reprieve for businesses and consumers affected by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the recent trade talks between the United States and China, exporters are evaluating the impact of the reduced tariff rates.

However, these rates do not include previous tariffs or other duties on specific goods. The new effective tariff rate is estimated to be around 50%, which includes the 20% tariffs imposed during Trump's first term and the 30% in new duties still in force.</p>
