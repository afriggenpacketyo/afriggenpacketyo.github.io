          <p>LEVA, a delivery robot developed by Swiss universities, combines wheels and legs to autonomously navigate various terrains and lift heavy boxes. It utilizes GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras to perceive its surroundings and avoid obstacles. LEVA can load and unload cargo boxes weighing up to 187 pounds without human assistance, securing the box with powered hooks. This technology has potential applications in package delivery, agriculture, construction, and emergency response, offering faster, more reliable deliveries and reducing the need for manual labor.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and preemptively screen patients is creating problems. The author, Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and carefully consider a diagnosis. While acknowledging the benefits of advanced medical technology, she cautions against overdiagnosis, which can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety. She suggests that diagnosis is a clinical skill that requires understanding the patient's story in the context of tests.</p>
