          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, climbing over 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This inclusion, which follows months of speculation, is a major milestone for the company as it typically triggers substantial stock purchases from passive index funds that track the S&P 500. The stock has performed exceptionally well this year, with its value increasing by more than 210% year-to-date. Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment in the widely followed market benchmark, validating its growth since its 2021 public offering.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Medicare Part A is typically free for eligible seniors, Part B requires a monthly premium, which stands at $185 in 2025, creating a financial burden for those on fixed incomes. This article explains that completely avoiding the premium is rare, but options exist to delay enrollment or receive financial assistance. Seniors still working with creditable employer health insurance can postpone Part B enrollment without penalty. Additionally, low-income individuals may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid, which can cover the premium. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in Unrivaled, a 3-on-3 women's basketball league, as part of a funding round that values the league at $340 million. The league, which aims to provide WNBA players with a high-paying offseason alternative to playing overseas, also attracted investments from other prominent athletes like soccer star Alex Morgan and tennis pioneer Billie Jean King. Unrivaled claims to offer the highest average salary in the history of professional women's sports leagues. Williams, who retired from tennis in 2022, has been actively investing in early-stage companies since establishing her fund in 2017.</p>

          <p>With interest rates in flux, savers with a significant sum like $40,000 face a critical choice between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account. While both currently offer attractive rates in the 4% range, a key difference is that a CD locks in its rate for the entire term, protecting against future declines. Conversely, a high-yield savings account offers liquidity, allowing access to funds without penalty, which is crucial if the money might be needed unexpectedly. Savers should weigh the long-term earning potential of a fixed-rate CD against the flexibility of a variable-rate savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Initial projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's minority Labour Party government is on track to win a narrow victory. The ruling center-left alliance is expected to secure a slim majority of 87 seats in the 170-seat parliament, allowing Stoere to remain in power. The election campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living, wealth taxes, and the quality of public services. However, global instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies, also played a role, potentially leading voters to favor the stability of the incumbent government.</p>

          <h2>England's Football Manager Considers Reintroducing Long Throw-Ins as a Tactical Weapon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has indicated that the national team may adopt the long throw-in as a key tactical element for the upcoming World Cup. This strategy, famously utilized by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League, with more teams using it to create scoring opportunities directly from the sideline. Throw-in specialists and data analysis suggest that it is an underestimated part of the game that can significantly improve a team's possession and attacking threat. Tuchel acknowledged the limited preparation time but stated that such set-piece details will be crucial for success at the tournament.</p>

          <p>An "early season cold front" is set to bring a significant drop in temperatures across California this week, offering relief from recent heatwaves and wildfire-conducive conditions. Forecasters predict a rapid cooling trend with daytime highs falling 10 to 20 degrees below average, a notable shift since June. The low-pressure system is also expected to bring light rain and thunderstorms to Northern California, which could help suppress ongoing wildfires. While Southern California is not expected to receive significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may bring some drizzle, though not enough to mitigate the high fire risk in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased when rates were peaking near 8% may be considering a refinance. This article outlines critical questions to contemplate before acting, such as whether current rates are low enough to justify the move; a one-percentage-point drop is a common benchmark. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for them to rise unexpectedly. Finally, it is essential to calculate the closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and ensure long-term plans for the home make the refinance financially sensible.
