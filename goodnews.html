          <p>The UK and India are set to sign a free trade agreement projected to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually and create over 2,200 jobs. The deal will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewelry cheaper in the UK. A key provision is a reciprocal social security agreement, which officials state aligns with existing deals and will not undercut British workers. The agreement also includes enhanced cooperation on tackling illegal migration, defense, and technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a surge in innovation, with a record 43 new drugs approved in the first half of 2025, a 59% increase year-over-year. This rapid approval process, streamlined by the National Medical Products Administration, is encouraging more long-term R&D investment from both domestic and global companies. Many of the newly approved drugs target serious conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. The trend highlights a shift in pharmaceutical discovery momentum, with China becoming a more significant player in developing and licensing innovative medicines for the global market.</p>

          <h2>Diet, Not Lack of Exercise, Is the Primary Driver of Obesity, Major Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new comprehensive study challenges the common belief that a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of modern obesity. Researchers compared daily calorie expenditure across diverse populations, from hunter-gatherers to office workers, and found that total energy burn is surprisingly similar regardless of activity levels. This suggests our bodies compensate for energy spent on exercise by reducing it elsewhere. The findings provide strong evidence that the shift in diet, particularly the rise of ultra-processed foods, is the principal factor behind increasing obesity rates, rather than a collective decline in physical activity.</p>

          <p>Professional chef David Nayfeld is encouraging parents to embrace the mess and cook with their children in his new cookbook, "Dad, What's for Dinner?". Nayfeld argues that involving kids in the kitchen, from simple tasks for toddlers to more complex ones for older children, builds confidence, expands their palates, and strengthens family bonds. The book features family-friendly recipes with 'mess ratings' and practical advice for navigating the kitchen with kids of all ages. He emphasizes that the shared experience and memories created are more valuable than achieving a perfect, clean outcome.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations and showing a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. The positive result was achieved despite mixed performance in its key investment banking unit, where fixed income and currencies performed well but origination and advisory revenues fell. The bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets, citing good business momentum and cost discipline. Officials noted a slight slowdown in corporate loan growth but pointed to renewed stability in Germany's political landscape as a positive factor for client sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The transfer of Marcus Rashford from Manchester United to Barcelona has generated significant intrigue in the Catalan capital, as fans and journalists assess where he will fit into a well-stocked forward line. While seen as a versatile player who can provide depth, he was reportedly not the club's first choice. There is acknowledgement of his high potential from a few years ago, but also awareness of his recent dip in form. The move is viewed as a win-win, offering Rashford a chance to reignite his career and Barcelona a valuable squad addition, with hopes that he can emulate the success of past English players at the club.</p>

          <p>China is aiming to strengthen its ties with Nepal by implementing more infrastructure projects in areas like agriculture, new energy, and health, according to a top Chinese official. This push is part of the broader Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, a key component of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. The move comes as China and India compete for influence in the strategically located Himalayan nation. While India has traditionally been Nepal's main ally, Beijing has increased its presence in recent years through significant investments in Nepalese infrastructure, from roads to hydropower plants.</p>

          <p>Sean Green, a 36-year-old from Angus, has completed an eight-and-a-half-year challenge to mountain bike down all of Scotland's 282 Munros, which are mountains over 3,000 feet. He is believed to be only the second person in history to achieve this feat, which involved climbing each summit with his bike on his back before cycling down the narrow paths. The semi-professional cyclist and father-of-two said the most difficult part of the quest was the logistics and time away from family. His epic journey, combining his love for mountains and biking, concluded in Glencoe.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a pilot program offering monthly electronic coupons to seniors to help cover the costs of elderly care services. This rare use of direct fiscal support is aimed at easing the financial burden on families, stimulating the elder-care market, and boosting domestic consumption. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan per month, will be available to seniors assessed with moderate to complete physical disabilities. The policy reflects Beijing's growing focus on strengthening its social safety net to address mounting demographic pressures from a rapidly aging population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The ruling is a major blow to the Serious Fraud Office and raises significant questions about the basis of the original prosecutions. The decision could pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. It also fuels calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the broader rate-rigging scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and central banks. (not investment advice)</p>
