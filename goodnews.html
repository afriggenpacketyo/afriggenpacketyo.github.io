          <p>Japan remains at 118th place out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap rankings, the lowest among G7 nations, according to the World Economic Forum. While there has been improvement in women's economic participation, Japan ranks poorly in political empowerment due to the low number of female government ministers and the lack of a female prime minister. The report estimates it will take 123 years to achieve full gender parity globally. Japan's overall performance slightly improved from last year, but progress in narrowing the gender gap has been slow since 2006, scoring below the average trend of improvement for the countries analyzed.</p>

The review includes extra money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain". However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget cuts. The NHS budget will increase by 3% per year for three years, while the Home Office's day-to-day budget will decrease, though police funding will rise, provided local council taxes increase.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. The judge issued a pause on the injunction until June 13 to allow the federal government time to appeal. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war. The judge cited the lack of compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody and noted the irreparable harm to his career and reputation.</p>
