          <p>A Big Bear man was arrested after authorities discovered he was allegedly operating an illegal psychedelic mushroom business out of the Jah Healing Cannabis Church in Big Bear Lake. Deputies executed a search warrant following citizen complaints, finding approximately three ounces of psychedelic mushrooms on 48-year-old Christopher Tindall, identified as the 'mushroom sales shop' owner. Tindall was arrested on felony charges related to illegal psilocybin mushroom sales. The church, which considers cannabis its sacrament, had previously been shut down in 2022 for functioning as an illegal dispensary and is still pursuing legal challenges.</p>

Ellison aims to nearly double film output to 15-20 movies annually, prioritizing theatrical releases and filmmaker-driven originals. He also expressed a desire to move the company away from political divisions to reach broader audiences, following a lawsuit settlement related to a '60 Minutes' interview. Despite cost-saving measures and potential layoffs, the new leadership is making significant content bets, including UFC streaming rights and 'South Park' deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska's capital, saw its glacier-related flood threat recede after the Mendenhall River crested at a record 16.65 feet due to an outburst flood from Suicide Basin. City officials expressed relief that temporary 'Hesco' barriers largely prevented catastrophic damage, saving hundreds of homes from flooding for a second consecutive year. While some areas remained submerged and the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area is closed, evacuated residents were allowed to return. Glacier outburst floods have become an annual concern since 2011, prompting long-term study for permanent mitigation solutions as the Mendenhall Glacier continues to act as an ice dam.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing loved ones—including partners, children, and even pets—on work trips, according to a TravelPerk survey. This 'bleisure' travel allows professionals to reclaim family time, avoid loneliness, and achieve cost savings by leveraging company-covered expenses for part of the trip. While many don't openly broadcast these arrangements to colleagues, companies generally accept the practice as long as business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. The blend of personal and business travel is a growing market, projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is on the verge of losing his Infowars studio and brand as a Texas state judge ordered the company's assets to be turned over to a receiver for sale. This action aims to pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims' families, whom Jones falsely claimed were actors. The ruling paves the way for the seizure and liquidation of Infowars' property, potentially ending Jones's run under the brand. Attorneys for the families are pleased, hoping for a swift resolution and the possibility of the Infowars name being sold to a satirical site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. Researchers found that taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions in first-time instances and recurrent events across these areas, which are often linked to impulsive and distracted behaviors. The findings, based on data from 148,500 people in Sweden, highlight the wider potential benefits of medication beyond managing core symptoms, offering crucial evidence for patients considering treatment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that US President Donald Trump's new curbs on China's shipbuilding industry are prompting South Korean shipbuilders to invest more in Southeast Asia, particularly ASEAN nations. This strategic shift aims to address constraints like limited capacity, labor shortages, and domestic union tensions that have diminished South Korea's competitiveness against China. HD Hyundai, for example, plans a 10-year lease to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, investing $550 million to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. While seen as a viable long-term solution, experts caution that improving worker skills in new locations will take time.</p>

While this environment can scale misinformation, the article highlights the emergence of 'evidence-based creators'—journalists and specialists who use expertise and reliable sources to combat falsehoods and provide context. These creators, operating without institutional safety nets, face an uphill battle against viral lies but build trust through direct engagement.

          <p>Kevin Hochman, CEO of Brinker International (owner of Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy), credits a significant increase in marketing budget—from $32 million to $137 million—for Chili's impressive 23.7% rise in same-store sales. The company exceeded earnings and revenue expectations and raised its full-year forecast. Hochman highlighted the success of social media influencers, both paid and organic, and the standardization of Chili's $10.99 value meal, which resonates with customers due to its simplicity. Brinker is leveraging this growth to offset rising labor and goods costs, focusing on improving locations, food, and labor to 'explode margins.' (not investment advice)</p>
