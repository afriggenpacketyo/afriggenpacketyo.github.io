          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a reduction in its 2025 sales growth forecast, citing increased competition from copycat drug compounders impacting sales of its popular Wegovy weight loss drug. Despite this adjustment, the company reported a first-quarter net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), surpassing analysts' expectations. Sales of Wegovy rose 83% year-on-year, although slightly below analyst predictions, while Ozempic sales exceeded forecasts, and the company now projects sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous estimate of 16% to 24%.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement designed to reduce the cost of goods and services exchanged between the two nations, with the UK lowering taxes on goods imported from India, including clothing, food products, jewellery, and some cars, while India has cut taxes on goods imported from the UK, including cosmetics, scotch whisky, higher-value cars, food, medical devices, aerospace, and electrical machinery. The British government hails the agreement as the most significant since leaving the European Union, expecting it to boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040, with a ¬£4.8 billion boost to the UK economy, though the deal won't take effect for up to a year.</p>

Arsenal have not scored in any of their past seven semi-final matches in all competitions (losing five and drawing two). Thomas Partey's return to Arsenal's midfield could be decisive, as could Ousmane Dembele's fitness after only training since Monday. Then there is the tactical battle, won by Luis Enrique in the first leg but, thanks to Mikel Arteta's mid-game tweaks, perhaps set up to swing in Arsenal's favour.</p>
