          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August, setting new Instagram records with their joint post. Kelce proposed at his $6 million Missouri home, creating an "enchanted garden" scene adorned with thousands of flowers, a likely nod to Swift's album "evermore." The custom old mine brilliant cut ring was designed by New York goldsmith Kindred Lubeck. The couple's relationship famously began after Kelce's attempt to give Swift a friendship bracelet, a gesture she found reminiscent of a John Hughes movie.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.70 billion, making it the third-highest in history, after no winning ticket emerged from Wednesday night's drawing. The odds of winning the grand prize are 1 in 292.2 million, with the next drawing scheduled for Saturday night. The cash value option for the jackpot is approximately $770.3 million before taxes. This significant sum follows a series of large Powerball wins, with two out of the four jackpot winners this year originating from Southern California.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett asserted that the Supreme Court "should not be imposing its own values on the American people," emphasizing that the law is not merely an "opinion poll." In her first television interview, she discussed the court's role in interpreting the Constitution and statutes, not legislating from the bench. Barrett's comments come as the court faces a longshot bid to revisit its same-sex marriage ruling, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She rebuffed predictions that other precedents are at risk, asserting the court's focus on legal interpretation.</p>

          <p>Applications for U.S. jobless benefits rose modestly last week to 237,000, slightly above economists' expectations, yet remain within a historically healthy range. This suggests employers are largely retaining workers despite signs of economic slowing, contributing to what many describe as a “no hire, no fire” economy. The unemployment rate holds at a low 4.2%, but hiring has weakened, with job openings also decreasing. This data point is being closely watched by the Federal Reserve, potentially influencing a key interest rate cut later this month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Bulgaria Urged to Recognize Transgender 'Lived Gender Identity'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 10:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A non-binding legal opinion issued to the European Court of Justice recommends that Bulgarian authorities should not refuse identity documents reflecting a transgender woman's "lived gender identity." The Advocate General's advice argues that such refusal infringes on fundamental rights like freedom of movement and that legal recognition should not be contingent on gender reassignment surgery. This case addresses the daily challenges faced by individuals due to discrepancies between their gender presentation and official identification. The opinion highlights the broader debate on transgender rights and identity recognition within the European Union.</p>

          <p>Atlassian has agreed to acquire The Browser Co., a startup known for its AI-powered web browsers like Arc and Dia, for $610 million in cash. Atlassian's co-founder and CEO, Mike Cannon-Brookes, sees an opportunity to enhance browser functionality for work, integrating Arc's power-user features and Dia's AI into its enterprise offerings. The Browser Co. had previously struggled with mass-market adoption of Arc's specialized features, leading to earlier acquisition talks with other tech giants. This deal aims to combine specialized browser capabilities with Atlassian's software expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, an inspirational story highlights the resilience and unity forged between a predominantly Black church, Franklin Avenue Baptist, and a predominantly white church, First Baptist New Orleans. Both suffered significant damage, but First Baptist opened its doors to Franklin Avenue's scattered congregation, fostering continuous religious unity and community support. This collaboration transcended racial and economic barriers, providing hope and a sense of normalcy for traumatized residents. The partnership was honored for bringing the community together "in the wreckage" and demonstrating the love of Jesus.</p>

          <p>This article explores the enduring, yet often questioned, relevance of high-school reunions in American life, despite predictions of their demise due to social media. The author reflects on personal ambivalence towards attending, contrasting it with her mother's positive experience of rekindled romance. Sociologists view reunions as "autobiographical occasions" for self-construction and comparison, a function that social media's algorithmic changes have made less accessible. Ultimately, reunions offer a unique opportunity to gauge personal growth, release past versions of oneself, and strengthen long-standing friendships, proving their unsinkable place in the social calendar.</p>
