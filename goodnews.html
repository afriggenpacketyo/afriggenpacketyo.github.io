        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical context and development of the 25th Amendment, which provides clear instructions for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of a young lawyer, John Feerick, who embarked on a mission to address the constitutional void regarding a president's inability to serve, a concern amplified after events like JFK's assassination. The amendment, a crucial addition to the Constitution, ensures governmental stability by outlining procedures for transferring power, temporary or permanent, and has become a vital component of American political continuity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy grew by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 0.1%. Growth was primarily driven by the services sector, with computer programming, health, and vehicle leasing showing momentum, while construction also increased. Despite this positive data, economists caution that this rebound is unlikely to continue into the third quarter due to a softening labor market and ongoing inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation with subdued growth and a loosening job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a copyright infringement claim against Pinkfong's viral "Baby Shark" song, ruling that the plaintiff's 2011 rendition was not original enough to warrant protection. US composer Jonathan Wright had claimed the 2015 hit copied his version, but the court upheld earlier decisions, stating the song is based on a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. This ruling confirms Pinkfong's stance that "Baby Shark" is derived from a public domain singalong chant, solidifying its status as a global phenomenon with over 16 billion YouTube views.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney stated he was "really disappointed" by Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments questioning his work ethic during his 83-day tenure as Birmingham City head coach. Brady, a minority owner at the club, made the remarks in a documentary. Rooney countered that Brady, with his NFL background, didn't fully understand football's demands for player rest, noting the significant differences between the sports' seasons. Despite the criticism, Rooney acknowledged Brady's status as a great athlete and the club's current positive trajectory under new management and significant investment.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion, the largest ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially raising the total value to $7.3 billion. This sale surpasses previous records for NFL and NBA teams. The new ownership group includes Boston businessmen Rob Hale and Bruce Beal Jr., taking over from Wyc Grousbeck's group, which bought the team in 2002 for $360 million and oversaw two NBA championships.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains BTec qualifications, practical courses equivalent to GCSEs (BTec Firsts) or A-levels (BTec Nationals), assessed through exams, coursework, and projects. BTecs are graded from Pass to Starred Distinction and serve as a pathway to university or employment, particularly popular among white working-class students. Recent government plans to streamline post-16 education initially threatened BTec funding, but the Labour government has since reversed many of these cuts, preserving key courses in sectors like health, engineering, and agriculture. The rollout of T-levels, another vocational qualification, will continue despite earlier challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees over half of business travelers, including 73% of C-suite executives, bringing family members, friends, or even pets on work trips. This "bleisure" travel allows professionals to reclaim family time, avoid loneliness, and significantly cut personal vacation costs by leveraging company-covered expenses. While companies often have a "policy grey zone" regarding companions, many quietly permit it as long as business objectives are met and personal expenses are clearly separated. This blend of business and leisure is projected to grow substantially, offering benefits like improved morale and employee loyalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater awareness of alcohol's negative health effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues. Younger generations, in particular, show lower consumption rates and higher awareness of moderation's harm, influenced by social acceptability of sobriety, rising alcohol costs, and changing social interaction patterns. The article also notes a significant drop in alcohol use among women.</p>
