Her emotional speech, emphasizing a new path away from external hindrances, drew thousands to Turangawaewae Marae, highlighting her significant symbolic and cultural influence despite a ceremonial role.

          <p>China aims to nearly double its sports sector to a US$980 billion economy by 2030, establishing "internationally influential" sports companies and events. This ambitious goal is part of a central government directive to expand domestic demand and shift towards a consumption-driven economic model. The sector's value was 3.67 trillion yuan in 2023, contributing 1.15% to GDP. Authorities will enhance guidance for regions hosting international events, signaling a strategic push to capitalize on growing enthusiasm for spectator sports and outdoor activities as a key economic driver.

          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, primarily due to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Clothing, footwear, and online retailers experienced strong growth, partially offsetting declines in supermarkets and household goods. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) acknowledged and apologized for previous errors in its data, which had delayed the report, and outlined improvement plans. While the July figures suggest decent momentum, economists warn that these boosts are temporary, and upcoming tax rises could dampen future retail sector performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Democrats are seeking to unseat older party members in Congress, driven by discontent with current leadership and a desire for new strategies. In contrast, young Republicans appear more content with their party's direction, with fewer challenging incumbents, often preferring to build experience at state and local levels first. This generational split highlights differing levels of satisfaction with party performance and approaches to political advancement. The article notes that despite recent increases, lawmakers under 40 still constitute less than 10% of the current Congress.</p>

          <p>The German Women's Bundesliga is expanding to a 14-club competition, aiming to boost its visibility and competitiveness following increased interest in women's football. The season opener between Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen has already sold over 50,000 tickets, a league record, and more matches will be broadcast free-to-air.

          <p>Kenya's Treasury is in advanced talks with the Export-Import Bank of China to convert dollar-denominated debt into yuan, aiming to ease pressure on its foreign reserves and significantly reduce interest rates.

This move, described as a "win-win," reflects Kenya's strategy to manage its debt more effectively and diversify its financial arrangements, potentially setting a precedent for other nations dealing with foreign currency debt.

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK are set to witness a total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening, which will turn the full Moon a striking red, known as a "Blood Moon." Although the eclipse begins before moonrise in the UK, observers can catch the second half of the event as the Moon rises in total eclipse around 19:30 BST. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth is directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a shadow and refracting red light through Earth's atmosphere. The article provides viewing tips, including finding a clear horizon, and notes the next such event visible in the UK is in 2026.</p>
