        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, asserting that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, marking the first major legal challenge to Trump's tariffs. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar making gains against safe-haven peers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A renowned Chinese scholar, Wu Xinbo, suggests that Beijing should anticipate Washington adopting alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, noting the Trump administration's recognition of the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. Wu believes that while Trump might continue using tariffs as a negotiating tool, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. He also said that China needs to be alert to the possibility that Trump may play other cards related to science, diplomacy, and security, given his awareness of the tariff card's limitations.</p>

          <p>California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have helped their sales by allowing for a year-round supply and increasing demand. The lifting of the ban on Mexican avocados in 1997 has led to booming avocado consumption in the United States, with the fruit becoming a regular offering in various establishments. California farmers, who grow about 10% of the avocados eaten in the U.S., support the continued flow of Mexican avocados while also advocating for robust inspections to prevent pests.</p>
