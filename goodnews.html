        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is officially ending its policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change is effective immediately, citing dramatic evolution in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While passengers will still need to remove belts, coats, and large electronics, this change aims to streamline the screening process and make travel more enjoyable for the public.</p>

          <p>Just a week after his £60m transfer to Chelsea, Brazilian forward João Pedro scored two stunning goals in his first start to lead the team to the Club World Cup final. Playing against Fluminense, his boyhood club, the 23-year-old showed respect by not celebrating either of his brilliant strikes. His performance was lauded not just for the goals but for his overall play, giving Chelsea a new dynamic in their attack. After the match, he expressed gratitude to his former club but affirmed his professionalism and focus on his new role.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the creation of a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with a port on Peru's Pacific coast. The proposed 2,800-mile corridor would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to Chancay, Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days compared to routes using the Panama Canal. The agreement initiates a multi-year study to assess the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of the massive infrastructure project, which has an estimated cost exceeding $70 billion.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a decorated U.S. warship, resting deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made using advanced seafloor mapping and confirmed by a global team of experts.</p>

          <p>Mandonna "Donna" Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. since 1978 without legal status, has been released from ICE detention. Her sudden arrest in June, which came a day after U.S. airstrikes in Iran, sparked a significant community response in New Orleans. A letter-writing campaign highlighting her decades of community service and a law-abiding life drew the attention of lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened. Kashanian, who is married to a U.S. citizen, had previously been allowed to remain in the country under judicial supervision.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for late July, savers are being advised to strategically manage their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts before potential interest rate changes. Experts suggest that individuals should lock in current high CD rates, which are still widely available, as future rate cuts could diminish earning potential. Key steps include carefully calculating deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties and shopping at online banks, which often offer higher rates. Acting before the Fed's meeting could help protect savings and maximize interest in a shifting economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Gunn's "Superman" reboot presents a hero, played by David Corenswet, who is more impulsive and overwhelmed than idealistic, according to this review from the Los Angeles Times. The film skips the origin story and instead pits a recovering Superman against a techno-zealot Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) in an impatient but entertaining plot. The reviewer finds the movie struggles with sincerity, coming off as silly when it tries to be earnest, and that the hero himself seems more obtuse than naive. While there are fun cameos and supporting characters, the overall tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting.</p>

The volunteer group, which has experience with flood zones along the Rio Grande, is aiding local authorities in the search for victims along the Guadalupe River. The effort comes amid heightened political tensions over immigration but has been praised by US officials as a symbol of unity. This follows a similar instance where two Mexican camp counselors were lauded for saving at least 20 girls during the initial flooding.</p>
