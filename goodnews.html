          <p>Mercosur, South America's largest trade bloc, has sealed a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland. This landmark deal, a decade in the making, establishes a free trade area covering nearly 300 million people and over $4.3 trillion in combined GDP. It aims to significantly boost bilateral trade by improving market access for over 97% of exports and eliminating customs duties. The agreement, announced at a Mercosur summit, awaits parliamentary approval from all member countries, distinguishing itself from the EU's similar, yet unratified, deal with Mercosur.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' ambitious quest to set a new MLB All-Star Game record for starting players concluded with only three of their eight finalists being voted into the lineup. Shohei Ohtani, already a confirmed starter, will be joined by catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman. This outcome leaves the 1976 Cincinnati Reds' record of five starting players intact. The remaining five Dodgers finalists were outvoted, and their potential selection as reserves now depends on votes from MLB players and the commissioner‚Äôs office. The article details the historical precedents and controversies surrounding All-Star fan selections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, establishing a 20% tariff on imports, a notable reduction from the initially threatened 46% levy. In exchange, Vietnam will grant the United States "TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade" with zero tariffs on American products. The agreement also imposes a steeper 40% tariff on goods identified as "trans-shipping," addressing concerns about Chinese products being rerouted through Vietnam. This deal, a result of Trump's "reciprocal" tariff strategy, is expected to benefit companies that had relocated manufacturing to Vietnam to circumvent earlier China tariffs. The Trump Organization also has development projects in Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer also pointed to the dollar reaching a four-year low, considering this beneficial for consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble, as it makes their exports more competitive internationally.

          <p>This article celebrates the enduring legacy of rock 'n' roll pioneer Ritchie Valens, who tragically died at 17 in a 1959 plane crash. Adapted from Merrick Morton‚Äôs book, it highlights Valens's innovative approach to music, blending Spanish flamenco, Black doo-wop, and hillbilly guitar sounds to create hits like "Donna" and the iconic "La Bamba." The article details how his music, rooted in his Chicano heritage and Los Angeles' diverse radio scene, broke barriers and influenced future Latin artists. It also explores the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba" and its soundtrack, which further cemented his cultural impact and helped pave the way for Latin music's global success.</p>
