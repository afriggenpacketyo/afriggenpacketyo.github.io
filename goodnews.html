          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a 7% fall in energy bills starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year for approximately 22 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This reduction translates to an annual saving of ¬£129 for a typical household using gas and electricity, reflecting a drop in wholesale gas prices. While charities welcome the price decrease, they emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, owing about ¬£4 billion to suppliers. Despite this summer relief, analysts anticipate little change in prices come October.</p>

          <p>Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims that he was the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett was convicted in 2021 on charges of staging the incident, but the conviction was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. The city believes the settlement provides a fair and conclusive resolution.</p>
