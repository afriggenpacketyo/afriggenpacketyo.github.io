          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to ease some U.S. sanctions on Syria, following the collapse of the Assad regime and the formation of a transitional government. The new Syrian leadership has been lobbying for sanctions relief to help pay civil service salaries, rebuild infrastructure, and restore the healthcare system after a 13-year civil war. This move aligns with the interests of U.S. allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who support normalizing relations with the new government. While some sanctions require congressional action to be revoked, the executive order marks a significant policy shift toward supporting Syria's recovery.</p>

The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, and is expected to close by early 2026.

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and twelve other cities and counties. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with women and minority workers disproportionately seeing a pay increase. The raises are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments, standing in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The annual wage increase for a full-time worker will range from an average of $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.</p>

The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta, and was expected to generate significant revenue for Canada.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners consider tapping into their home's equity, experts are highlighting the key differences between home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). While both currently offer lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, their rate structures are distinct. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially advantageous if rates fall later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond trading, offering stability but less direct correlation with Fed cuts. Experts suggest that borrowers weigh their need for predictable payments against the potential for future rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components as it seeks to reduce its dependence on China. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a trend driven by Western security concerns over Chinese technology, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Taiwanese firms are promoting a "non-red" supply chain, free from Chinese influence, which is attractive to European partners. While a complete decoupling from China is unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying the supply of critical components like software and chips, an area where Taiwan's advanced tech sector can play a key role.</p>
