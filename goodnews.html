          <p>President Donald Trump publicly admonished Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would lead to price increases for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should absorb the tariff costs rather than passing them on to customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously stated that the company was experiencing unprecedented price increases due to tariffs. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, acknowledging the challenges posed by retail margins, while other companies are also warning about higher prices due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," was approximately the length of an index finger and possessed a circular mouth lined with teeth. The discovery revealed that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts, featuring a multi-segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills. This finding provides new insights into the diversity of animal life during the Cambrian period.</p>
