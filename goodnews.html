        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed down for the second consecutive month due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, with exports to the U.S. shrinking for the first time since December of the previous year, falling by 1.8%. This has narrowed Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. to 780.6 billion yen in April, compared to 846.9 billion yen in March. Experts anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact GDP growth in the second quarter, leading the central bank to potentially delay its next interest rate hike until there is more clarity on U.S. tariffs.

          <p>NFL owners are expected to discuss the potential ban of the 'tush push' play, a controversial short-yardage tactic, at upcoming league meetings. Philadelphia Eagles players, including A.J. Brown and Jordan Mailata, have downplayed the significance of the possible ban. Mailata humorously expressed his dislike for the name 'tush push,' while emphasizing that the team's focus remains on installing offensive schemes and striving for a championship, regardless of the league's decision on the play. The Green Bay Packers have submitted a proposal to ban the tush push.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives, following public criticism and government intervention. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable."

The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).
