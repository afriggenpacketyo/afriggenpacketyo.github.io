          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was already serving a 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder when he was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for overseeing the gang while in prison. His attorneys expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice for Hoover, who has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at a maximum-security prison in Colorado. It is unclear when Hoover will be released from federal custody as he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the "TACO" trade acronym, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out," used to describe his negotiating style regarding tariffs. The term, coined by a Financial Times columnist, refers to the pattern of stocks falling when Trump announces tariffs and then rising when he eases them. Trump defended his approach, stating that it is called negotiation and has led to better trade talks. He questioned whether maintaining tariff levels at a high percentage would be a better strategy.</p>

Trump cited the example of the European Union, which he had recently targeted with a 50% tariff before delaying the levy. He credited the tariff threat with prompting the EU to engage in trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>
