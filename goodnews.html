          <p>The Canton Fair, China's largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a surge in foreign buyers from across the globe, with the notable exception of American buyers, who are less prevalent due to increasing tariffs from the US. Organizers and exporters are prioritizing premium service for overseas buyers, accommodating language preferences beyond English, reflecting a shift in the established trade order. The reporter attending the Canton Fair noted the large crowds of foreign buyers, and the willingness of the fair to accomodate different languages.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's aspiration to become Prime Minister is no longer dismissed as a mere joke, especially after Reform UK's recent electoral gains. Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC notes that his success has altered the political landscape, forcing Labour to demonstrate the positive impact of governance. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party faces the challenge of regaining credibility, and Reform aims to prove its ability to govern effectively beyond campaigning. The article also suggests that Reform has been ahead of the Conservatives in the polls for months.</p>

          <p>Due to rising geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly shifting their real estate investments away from the US. In 2024, Chinese buyers' demand for homes costing over US$5 million has moved towards Thailand, Australia, and Canada, according to Juwai IQI data. This represents a significant shift from 2023 when the US was the top choice. Juwai IQI co-founder Kashif Ansari notes that geopolitical friction and increased scrutiny of property deals have discouraged some buyers, with Chinese investment in US homes dropping more than 50% from its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This marks a significant win for school choice advocates after years of efforts. The program provides families with $10,000 per year, or up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, to cover private school or homeschooling costs. Supporters say it will offer more options for students in underperforming public schools, while critics argue it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthy families.</p>

While SpaceX has received support from local officials, the creation of Starbase has drawn criticism due to concerns over Musk's control over the area, including potential beach closures for launches.
