          <p>The UK government is set to announce a major defense review, including plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines. These conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines will replace the current fleet from the late 2030s. The review also commits ¬£15 billion to the nuclear warhead program, and aims to move the armed forces to "warfighting readiness" amid growing global threats. The new submarines will support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with apprenticeships and graduate roles, as the UK aims to bolster its defense capabilities and deter Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>US tariffs and trade barriers are pushing Chinese tech companies to innovate and find cost-effective solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence. Higher tariffs could make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, potentially leading to strategies like open-sourcing AI models. Chinese firms are expected to aggressively target markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seek deeper trade relations with Europe, including technology transfers for market access. Despite uncertainties, Chinese companies are determined to overcome challenges under the Trump administration.</p>
