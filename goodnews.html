        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold steady its benchmark interest rate, remaining within the 4.25%-4.5% range, as policymakers evaluate the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy. The decision reflects concerns about rising economic risks, including the potential for stagflation‚Äîa combination of higher unemployment and inflation‚Äîdue to tariffs. While acknowledging a solid labor market, the Fed noted increased uncertainty about the economic outlook and remains attentive to both sides of its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. Market expectations anticipate potential rate cuts later in the year, contingent on economic developments.</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving office, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. criticized President Trump‚Äôs handling of foreign policy, particularly his approach to the war in Ukraine and dealings with global allies. Biden expressed dismay at Trump's combative meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his suggestions to rename the Gulf of Mexico and acquire Greenland. He defended his own decision to seek re-election, despite internal party concerns, and highlighted his administration's successes. Biden's re-emergence into the public sphere signals his intent to shape his legacy and remain a voice within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services granted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) an exemption to hire a new class of Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers, averting a potential halving of the fellowship program. These "disease detectives" are crucial for investigating outbreaks and responding to health emergencies. The program's continuation was uncertain due to a federal hiring freeze, but the exemption allows the CDC to onboard and train new EIS officers. This decision underscores the importance of these officers in maintaining public health infrastructure and responding to emerging threats.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, prospective home equity borrowers have time to analyze their options between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While historically a home equity loan was preferable during rate pauses due to its fixed rate, the current climate suggests a HELOC may be better due to the likelihood of future rate cuts. HELOCs currently offer lower average interest rates than home equity loans, providing potential savings for borrowers who can manage variable payments. Borrowers should carefully compare both options to ensure affordability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady has sparked questions about the future of mortgage rates. While the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, its policies influence the broader interest rate environment. The rate pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, especially if investors anticipate future rate cuts. However, mortgage rates also depend on inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty. Prospective homebuyers should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and explore different loan types to secure the lowest possible mortgage rates.</p>
