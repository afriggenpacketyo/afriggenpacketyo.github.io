        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices by asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce costs in the United States. However, the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices, leading to skepticism about its effectiveness. The order directs federal agencies to investigate why European countries have lower drug prices and encourages them to pay more. Pharmaceutical stocks rose following the announcement, as investors were relieved that the policy was less damaging than anticipated. The article also mentions ongoing efforts by Democrats to align American drug prices with those of foreign peers and notes the popularity of policies aimed at lowering drug costs among voters.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, as part of President Trump's tax and spending package. This provision aims to address concerns from lawmakers in high-tax states like California, New Jersey, and New York, where the current $10,000 limit has been a point of contention. Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the $10,000 limit on the federal deduction on state and local taxes is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, contributing to a surplus for the month.

While the U.S. continues to face a significant budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue helped reduce the imbalance in April.

          <p>A temporary reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods, down to 30%, is expected to trigger a surge in freight shipments as importers rush to move goods during the 90-day pause. However, this surge is also anticipated to lead to rising costs in the supply chain and potentially higher prices for consumers. The article quotes various logistics executives and retailers who express concerns about the unpredictability of trade policy and its impact on their businesses. Critical industries are also reporting low inventory levels, leading to a scramble to replenish supplies during the tariff pause.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs for 90 days, heralding success in trade negotiations. The two sides agreed that ongoing discussions have the potential to address the concerns of each side. The temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%.</p>

          <p>The Fountain Theatre is staging "White Rabbit Red Rabbit," an interactive play by Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour, where the actor receives the script for the first time on stage. The play is described as a theatrical message in a bottle, written by Soleimanpour when he was unable to travel. Audience members play a large role in the experience, making choices that influence the performance. The review notes that the performance is good-natured but could benefit from greater conviction and control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and China agreed to slash tariffs, which sent markets rising. The US will lower those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%. President Trump stated they might rise again in three months time, if no further progress was made. Under the new agreement, the US is reducing the "reciprocal" tariff on Chinese goods that it announced on "Liberation day" to 10%.</p>

          <p>After 40 years, with 40,000 people killed, the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, is ending its war against the Turkish state. A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party said it was an important step towards a country free of terror. The PKK decision to lay down its arms followed a call in February by its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who said there was "no alternative to democracy".</p>

          <p>The European Commission is analysing the trade deal struck last week between the United States and Britain for implications for the 27-nation European Union and global trade. The EU itself is in negotiations with Washington on its own trade deal that would replace 20% across the board tariffs on most EU goods and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars and car parts. The U.S. has set a 90-day negotiating window ending on July 8 for a deal.</p>
