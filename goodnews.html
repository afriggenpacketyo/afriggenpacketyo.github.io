          <p>An NPR producer and group of friends recreate the reality TV show 'Survivor' every year, spending a weekend competing in challenges and tribal councils. The tradition started during the pandemic and has evolved into a larger event with participants traveling from across the country. Friends not competing serve as producers, and each year two players plan the challenges and twists, acting as "Jeffs" in reference to the show's host. The games involve strategy, alliances, and voting each other off, with the winner earning bragging rights for the year, highlighting the strong friendships and shared love of the show.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing camaraderie and support for people with dementia and their caregivers, offering a space for socializing and activities. These cafes, which are relatively inexpensive to run, offer a sense of community and help combat social isolation, with over 600 operating across the country. The cafes benefit both patients and caregivers by easing stress and improving quality of life, and they are becoming increasingly important as cases of memory loss rise. As the population ages, the number of available family caregivers is decreasing, making memory cafes a vital resource for those affected by dementia.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates UK defence spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2034, underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. The review, based on this spending assumption, will outline priorities for military and security spending in the coming years, warning of a "new era of threat" involving drones and artificial intelligence. The plan includes deploying new "digital" experts to protect troops from enemy drones and control unmanned weapons. The government's budget watchdog estimates meeting the 3% target would cost an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30, demonstrating the financial commitment to defence.</p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and congestion, costing ¬£2bn. The 28-mile improvement is designed to bring prosperity to one of the UK's most deprived areas and cut journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The upgrade programme was initially drawn up in 1990 and work began in 2002, involving the construction of almost 70 structures and the planting of 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. Despite criticism over the cost and delays, Welsh ministers assert the upgrade will boost the region, though Plaid Cymru has called the funding a "waste of public money."</p>

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to start selling the rice, priced at 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, and long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. The government's effort aims to lower soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being sold directly to retailers.</p>
