          <p>A sports columnist argues that Clayton Kershaw's achievement of 3,000 career strikeouts solidifies his legacy as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The piece contends that Kershaw's remarkable longevity, consistency over 18 seasons, and superior numbers in key statistical categories give him the edge. The author contrasts Kershaw's enduring flame of a career with Koufax's brilliant but shorter meteor-like peak to make the case for his unparalleled greatness.</p>

Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the House means the question or measure being voted on is defeated. The rule states that a tied question "shall be lost." This mechanism has become particularly relevant given the razor-thin Republican majority, where even a few defections can endanger the passage of key legislation.</p>
