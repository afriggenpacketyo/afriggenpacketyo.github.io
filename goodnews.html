          <p>Prominent US labor unions, including the SEIU and the American Federation of Teachers, are playing a key role in organizing the nationwide 'No Kings' protests against the Trump administration. The demonstrations are intended to voice opposition to what organizers describe as growing authoritarianism and abuses of power, as well as frustration over economic issues like healthcare costs. Union leaders emphasize that the protests are a pro-democracy effort to ensure working people have a voice, drawing parallels between current political struggles and historical civil rights movements. The events are planned across all 50 states, signaling widespread and organized dissent.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded $19.7 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 Denver police shooting in the city's nightlife district. The incident occurred when officers opened fire on a suspect who had drawn a handgun, but their shots also struck several people in the crowded area. One of the officers, Brandon Ramos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned from the force. Attorneys for the victims stated that the verdict sends a clear message about police accountability and the responsibility to protect innocent bystanders during enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three solo home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out 10 batters while allowing only two hits over six shutout innings in the decisive 5-1 victory. His dominant two-way display in Game 4 of the NLCS earned him the series MVP award. The Dodgers will now seek to become the first team to win back-to-back World Series championships in 25 years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with over half of these cases caught at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently lack any routine screening programs, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer. The test is now undergoing a major trial with the UK's NHS, with results expected next year to determine its future role in healthcare.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park unexpectedly saved the life of 31-year-old Charlotte Morjaria from Newport. After being playfully picked up during a game, she felt a pop in her side and later went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A CT scan to check for internal damage revealed a large, previously undetected cancerous tumor on her kidney. The accidental discovery led to a diagnosis of a rare form of kidney cancer and the surgical removal of her kidney. Now cancer-free, she credits the holiday mishap with revealing the hidden disease and ultimately saving her life.</p>

          <p>Antony Easton discovered his family's hidden history as wealthy German Jews after finding a suitcase belonging to his late father, who had changed his name upon fleeing to England. The documents inside revealed that his family, the Eisners, had owned a massive steel empire and a fortune worth billions before it was stolen under Nazi rule in the 1930s. A decade-long investigation led Easton to trace his family's assets, including valuable artwork that was sold under duress. While most of the property is unrecoverable, he has successfully initiated the restitution process for several paintings, reconnecting with a past devastated by the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>Chinese car manufacturers have dramatically increased their presence in South Africa's SUV market, with sales volume surging by 86% in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year. This growth has boosted their total market share to 15%, largely driven by strong performances from brands like Chery and Haval. While Japanese automakers Toyota and Suzuki still lead in overall sales, their market dominance is eroding as Chinese brands offer competitive alternatives to consumers. The shift indicates a significant change in the competitive landscape of the South African automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>
