          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton swiftly won his Wimbledon second-round match in just 70 seconds after it controversially resumed from an overnight suspension. The match against Rinky Hijikata was halted due to fading light with Shelton about to serve for the win, a decision that initially frustrated the player. Upon returning to the court, Shelton served three aces and an unreturnable serve to secure his victory. He later explained that the umpire's decision was related to the operational time limit of the Hawk-Eye line-calling system, and he found a humorous side to the unusual situation.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart's 'Blind Box' Toy Popularity Expected to Endure Despite Chinese State Media Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 11:12:56 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite a Chinese state media editorial calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys to prevent addiction among children, analysts believe Pop Mart International, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic regulatory pressures. The brand's success is attributed to the "dopamine economy," where the excitement of uncertainty drives consumer purchases.</p>

          <p>An international security affairs expert has proposed that the U.S. could learn from China's "Wuhan model" to revitalize its rust-belt cities. This model involves creating integrated university-industry clusters in second-tier cities focused on advanced manufacturing. The suggestion follows a 10-day trip to China, where the expert observed high-tech firms in cities like Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen. Such economic cooperation could potentially stabilize tense U.S.-China relations, especially following a recent temporary de-escalation in the trade war between the two superpowers.

          <p>Researchers have uncovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. The analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutritious marrow and fat. This process, which required planning and organization, provided a crucial, high-energy food source that was essential for survival, particularly to avoid protein poisoning from a lean-meat diet. The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence showing that Neanderthals were more sophisticated and strategic than previously believed.</p>

          <p>Mark Sanfratello, 72, has been indicted on murder charges in the 1983 disappearance of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, in Oregon. The case went cold for decades until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. Peroni was 27 when she was last seen with Sanfratello at a party, reportedly walking into a wooded area after an argument. The new DNA evidence, combined with the original investigation, led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, who has been arrested in California and is awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for harassing Emily Hunt, the UK government's former adviser on sexual assault. Hunt expressed relief after a decade-long fight for justice, which began after Killick filmed her unconscious in a hotel room in 2015. Although initially arrested on suspicion of sexual assault, he was later convicted of voyeurism and repeatedly breached restraining orders by tweeting about Hunt. The judge noted Killick's unwavering persistence and Ms. Hunt's courage, highlighting a case that led to changes in UK law and brought attention to the justice system's failings.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. The comet is currently about 416 million miles from the sun and poses no threat to Earth, with its closest approach in October still being over 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. Scientists are studying its trajectory and composition to learn more about its origins from another planetary system. The increasing frequency of such detections is attributed to more advanced sky-scanning technology, with more discoveries expected in the coming years.</p>
