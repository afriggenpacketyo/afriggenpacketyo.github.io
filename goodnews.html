          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to US President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal, developed with France and Germany, follows the breakdown of US-led talks and aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. The initiative comes amid increasing domestic and international pressure on the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. Trump's immediate focus, however, appeared to be on delivering aid to the region, stating the priority is to "get the children fed" before discussing future peace arrangements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shareholders of the UK-based financial technology company Wise have approved a plan to move its main stock market listing to the United States. The company, valued at about £11 billion, aims to attract more investors and access deeper capital markets by establishing a dual listing in the US. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a "dual class" share structure, which enhances the voting power of co-founder and CEO Kristo Käärmann. Despite some opposition from co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and advisory service Pirc, the proposal passed with a significant majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced the names of the two separate companies that will emerge from its planned corporate split: Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. The Warner Bros. entity will encompass the film and television studios, HBO, HBO Max, and gaming properties, with CEO David Zaslav at the helm. Discovery Global will include the company's cable networks like CNN and TNT, led by current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. This division acknowledges that the 2022 merger was largely unsuccessful, failing to impress Wall Street and leaving the company with significant debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States were marked by months of volatility and escalating threats from the Trump administration. The talks began after the US imposed 25% tariffs on steel and autos, with President Trump later threatening blanket tariffs as high as 50% on all EU goods. The EU prepared extensive retaliatory measures but repeatedly paused them to allow for negotiations. After a series of reversals and last-minute demands from the US, the two sides finally reached a deal for a 15% baseline tariff, narrowly averting a full-scale trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The high-end real estate market in Los Angeles is showing significant strength, with five of the ten most expensive U.S. home sales in June located in California. The top sale was Paris Hilton and Carter Reum's $63 million purchase of Mark Wahlberg's former Beverly Hills mansion, which he had sold for a lower price in 2023. Brokers report that demand is being driven by buyers displaced by recent wildfires as well as increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China.

          <p>During a visit to the UK, US President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged "real starvation" is occurring in Gaza, directly contradicting claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump urged Israel to permit "every ounce of food" into the besieged territory, signaling a shift in his public stance on the humanitarian crisis. He made the comments during a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where he also expressed growing impatience with Russia over the war in Ukraine. This represents a notable rebuke of a key ally and increases pressure on Israel to address the dire situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. This ruling expands a previous injunction and blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting off payments for one year. In her order, the judge stated that restricting services would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing Medicaid funds would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>

It also recommends shopping around for the best rates, starting with one's current mortgage lender, and precisely determining the necessary loan amount to avoid over-borrowing and reduce the risk of foreclosure.

Healy warned that without these local pubs and clubs where artists begin their careers, the UK's cultural pipeline could dry up, preventing future iconic acts from emerging. The festival, organized by GigPig, will see over 1,000 venues host events in September to highlight their vital role and the economic challenges they face.
