          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured his fourth win of the season at the Miami Grand Prix, leading teammate Lando Norris in a thrilling race. Piastri showcased exceptional skill, overtaking Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to seize the lead and maintain his advantage. Norris recovered from an early setback to challenge Piastri, but the Australian driver held firm. George Russell of Mercedes claimed the final podium spot, while Ferrari faced internal tension as Lewis Hamilton's request to pass Charles Leclerc was initially denied before being accepted, though he ultimately failed to overtake Antonelli.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, snapping their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley on poorly executed sweepers. While May was otherwise effective, his inability to consistently land the pitch has been a source of frustration in recent outings. The Dodgers' offense also struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, providing limited support for May.</p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against relying too heavily on the procedure, citing its high costs and lack of guarantees. Egg freezing involves risks, both medical and financial, with no certainty of success. The optimal time to have a baby from a biological perspective is in one's 20s or early 30s, but society often pushes women to prioritize education and career before motherhood. Some critics also suggest that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be doing so to retain female employees rather than to support their family planning.</p>
