          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close in the second half of 2025; this announcement coincided with the release of DoorDash's first-quarter revenue figures, which fell short of analysts' expectations at $3.03 billion against the expected $3.09 billion. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash reported a rise in total orders to 732 million, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, and expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the second quarter to range from $600 million to $650 million. The company believes that both SevenRooms and Deliveroo will expand its ability to grow local commerce and support financial goals.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a significant jump after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, alongside reaffirming its financial outlook for the year. The company reported a 2% drop in revenue, adjusting for currency fluctuations, which totaled 999 million euros, slightly surpassing analysts' predictions of 979 million euros. While weaker sales were largely attributed to decreased demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, the group remains cautiously optimistic, monitoring macroeconomic developments and global trade tensions, while forecasting full-year sales to align with the previous year's figures, ranging from 4.2 billion to 4.4 billion euros.</p>

          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese robotaxi firm, is collaborating with Uber to introduce driverless taxis in the Middle East, marking a significant move toward autonomous driving technology. The companies plan to initially deploy Pony.ai's robotaxis on the Uber platform in a key Middle Eastern market, with further international expansion planned; Uber users will have the option to select a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle for their rides, with a safety operator present during the initial pilot phase. This collaboration is strategically crucial for Pony.ai's global expansion and enables Uber to integrate autonomous vehicles more swiftly and safely, as Uber also partners with Waymo in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared her intention to challenge the UK Labour government led by Keir Starmer when its decisions negatively impact Wales, emphasizing that her priority lies with the nation and its people. Morgan highlighted potential issues such as cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, advocating for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenues and for a revised funding formula that better reflects the country's needs. While affirming a bond with the UK Labour Party, she stressed the importance of standing up for Wales' interests, drawing a parallel to the relationship in the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey, where what suits Essex may not suit Barry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must be included in the final count, effectively securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers determined that removing ballots six months after election day would violate the due process and equal protection rights of affected voters. The judge also ordered the state board of elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by a narrow margin; the decision is currently stayed for seven days, pending a potential appeal from Riggs' Republican challenger, Jefferson Griffin.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct its movements. This revelation undermines the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage. The Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the story, but the declassified memo supports the original reporting.</p>
