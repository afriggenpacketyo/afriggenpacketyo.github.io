          <p>Norwegian tennis star Casper Ruud shared his frustration with the pervasive smell of marijuana in New York City, particularly at the US Open. Ahead of the tournament, the No. 12 seed stated that inhaling the odor during matches is 'not fun at all' and called it the 'worst thing about New York.' Despite New York legalizing marijuana in 2021, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is designated as a smoke-free facility. Ruud's comments echo similar complaints from other tennis players in previous years, highlighting an ongoing issue for athletes competing in the city. He acknowledged that little could be done unless laws are reversed.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has released its new Jetson AGX Thor robotics chip module, dubbed a 'robot brain,' as a developer kit priced at $3,499. This move signifies Nvidia's strategic focus on robotics as a major growth area beyond artificial intelligence, which has already seen the company's sales triple. The Thor chips, based on Blackwell graphics processors, are 7.5 times faster than previous generations, enabling advanced generative AI models for humanoid robots and self-driving cars. Despite robotics currently representing a small portion of Nvidia's revenue, the company is rapidly expanding its presence, with major players like Agility Robotics and Amazon utilizing its Jetson chips. Volume purchases of the Thor modules will be available for $2,999 each.</p>

He emphasized the importance of Nvidia's upcoming earnings report, noting strong demand for its AI offerings from major tech companies. Cramer strongly recommended buying Palo Alto Networks, calling its recent post-earnings dip an opportunity, and highlighted its planned acquisition of CyberArk. He described Palo Alto Networks' recent conference call as the best he had reviewed, anticipating long-term growth for the cybersecurity stock. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by the prevalence of 'ghost jobs'—job postings without a genuine intent to hire—tech worker Eric Thompson is leading a working group to propose federal legislation. The 'Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act' aims to make the practice illegal by requiring transparency in job listings, including intended hire dates and whether a role is new or a backfill. Companies often post ghost jobs to collect resumes or signal growth, but this creates a time-consuming headache for job seekers. Thompson's advocacy reflects a growing movement, with similar legislative efforts emerging in Canadian provinces and several U.S. states. The proposed federal law would apply to businesses with over 50 employees, imposing fines for violations and setting guidelines for posting duration.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a widespread 'blind box' craze, where consumers purchase items without knowing the exact variant until unboxing, fueling excitement and repeat purchases. This phenomenon has propelled Beijing-based Pop Mart, known for its Labubu elf-like monster dolls, to massive profits. The appeal extends beyond collectibles, with travel agents and supermarkets offering their own mystery versions, such as 'blind box' flight tickets. Young Chinese consumers, seeking affordable pick-me-ups amid economic uncertainty, have embraced the gamble and social aspect of collecting and trading. However, the Chinese government has voiced concerns about 'irrational consumption' and potential 'addiction,' particularly among minors, calling for stricter regulations on the trend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid uncertain economic conditions, high interest rates, and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts are advising on whether to prioritize high-yield savings accounts or stocks. High-yield savings are recommended for emergency funds, short-term goals, or risk minimization, offering principal protection and predictable, though potentially shrinking, returns. Stocks, conversely, are favored for long-term wealth building due to their potential for higher inflation-adjusted returns, despite significant market risk and volatility. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are also presented as an alternative for intermediate-term goals, allowing investors to lock in current rates. The optimal choice ultimately depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, requiring ongoing reevaluation of strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City's recent performances, including a 4-3 defeat in the Club World Cup and a 2-0 loss to Tottenham, suggest that Pep Guardiola's squad rebuild is still a work in progress. Despite a strong opening win against Wolves, defensive vulnerabilities and goalkeeping errors, particularly from new signing James Trafford, have been highlighted. The departure of long-serving goalkeeper Ederson and the potential signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma, known more for shot-stopping than passing, signal a possible shift in Guardiola's tactical approach. These early season missteps underscore that the team needs more than individual wins to re-establish its aura of invincibility. The team's midfield also showed struggles under pressure.</p>

While growth has slowed from triple-digit expansion, a 53% year-over-year revenue jump is expected, driven by its data center division, which accounts for 88% of sales. Analysts are keenly watching for strong Blackwell chip numbers, affirming Nvidia's technological lead and demand from major internet and cloud providers.

The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2026, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies. Following the separation, one entity will focus on coffee with $16 billion in annual sales, and the other on cold beverages with $11 billion.

This issue highlights the risks of relying on dedicated trust funds from volatile sources like oil-and-gas or gambling, and the need for sustained advocacy to ensure long-term, comprehensive support for early childhood education.

Roth 401(k)s offer higher contribution limits ($23,500 for 2025) and typically include employer matches, providing significant growth potential. However, they often have fewer investment choices and less flexibility for early withdrawals. Roth IRAs, while having lower contribution limits ($7,000 for 2025) and income restrictions, offer greater flexibility, allowing penalty-free withdrawal of contributions at any time. Advisors suggest contributing enough to a Roth 401(k) to secure an employer match before considering a Roth IRA, emphasizing that both can be utilized simultaneously for comprehensive retirement planning.
