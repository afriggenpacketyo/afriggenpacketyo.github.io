        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a historic election loss, Australia's Liberal Party has appointed Sussan Ley as its first female leader, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, a moderate, won by a narrow margin over Angus Taylor, who campaigned on restoring conservative values. This leadership change comes after the Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the May 3rd election, attributed to divisive leaders and policies that alienated women and younger voters. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, acknowledging the need to respect and represent modern Australia. </p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate since 2014, driven by the oil and gas sector, technology, and finance industries, according to a World Bank report. The World Bank projects a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025, but warns of slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's government implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency, which have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with nearly half the population living in poverty.</p>

While GLP-1 drugs can aid in weight loss, their use should be justified by the potential health benefits, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
