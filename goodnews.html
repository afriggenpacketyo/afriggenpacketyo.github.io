          <p>A complex prisoner swap has resulted in the freedom of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. The deal involved the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, with the latter returning 252 Venezuelan nationals from a high-security prison in exchange for the Americans and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing the release, stating every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The exchange was described by officials as a delicate, "down-to-the-wire" humanitarian deal that did not involve sanctions relief.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement and a source of national pride. The survey suggests that the public generally believes the space program contributes to both technological advancements and a positive national identity, with these views holding across party lines.</p>

          <p>The newly appointed Postmaster General, David Steiner, has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the U.S. Postal Service. In his first message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the agency's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity within the executive branch, easing concerns raised by his previous role as a FedEx board member. His statement was cautiously welcomed by postal union leaders, who have been protesting calls for privatization from some Trump administration officials. Steiner plans to assess and modify the ongoing "Delivering for America" reorganization plan to better serve customers and employees.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The legislation specifically targets stablecoins, a type of digital currency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, aiming to provide consumer protections and clear operational guardrails. The bill's passage, which had bipartisan support, allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. At the signing, Trump hailed the law as a pivotal step in what could be the greatest revolution in financial technology since the internet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix's recent strong quarterly performance, which saw a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, is being interpreted as a positive sign for Disney's streaming ambitions. Analysts note that Netflix's success with price hikes and its ad-supported tier suggests a healthy market where consumers are willing to pay for premium content. This trend could benefit Disney as it also raises prices for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ services to improve profitability in its direct-to-consumer division. Disney is scheduled to report its own earnings in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block oil development. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it affirms that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The outcome had been a point of uncertainty for investors, and Exxon's stock fell following the announcement.</p>

          <p>A historical feature from Deutsche Welle explores the concept of queerness across different eras and cultures, highlighting that non-binary identities and same-sex relationships have existed for millennia. The article discusses examples from ancient Rome and Greece, where same-sex love was common, to the life of Leonardo da Vinci and the coded diaries of 19th-century landowner Anne Lister. It also touches on the existence of a third gender in various Indigenous cultures. The piece contrasts historical acceptance with periods of persecution, emphasizing that modern LGBTQ+ rights are hard-won and must be protected.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending up 7% in the second quarter. This growth helps insulate the company from broader economic slowdown concerns. However, a notable weak spot was in airline spending, which was flat year-over-year, specifically due to a decline in spending on domestic economy class tickets. In contrast, spending on premium cabin airfare and high-end hotels remains strong. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite investor concerns over competition in the premium card market.
