        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong shares experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, fueled by positive earnings reports and promising revenue forecasts for the second quarter. The Chinese electric-vehicle maker's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of 2025, attributing this turnaround to strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. This optimistic outlook has led brokerages to maintain a buy rating on the stock, projecting substantial upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers mounted a remarkable comeback to defeat the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, overcoming a double-digit fourth-quarter lead. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers and Tyrese Haliburton's buzzer-beater sent the game into overtime, where the Pacers ultimately secured a 138-135 victory. The Knicks, who had previously completed comebacks of 20, 20, and 14 points against the Boston Celtics, fell victim to a similar rally. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 43 points, while Haliburton and Nesmith scored 31 and 30 points, respectively, for the Pacers.</p>

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts strategically sat Hern치ndez the previous day to ensure his availability for this game against Corbin Burnes, a decision that paid off handsomely. Dustin May pitched a strong six innings, allowing only one run, and the Dodgers' bullpen secured the win. Hern치ndez's timely hit underscored his ability to produce clutch moments for the team.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill would provide $1,000 to every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, in accounts now designated as "Trump accounts." The funds would be invested in financial markets, and proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. However, the accounts would function much like typical investment accounts, with post-tax contributions and gains also subject to taxation. The accounts have puzzled tax experts, who note they lack the tax advantages of retirement or health savings accounts.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing millions of dollars in emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty after the Trump administration withheld funds already designated by Congress. The network, which provides non-ideological news coverage to countries with restricted press freedom, has been facing financial challenges due to the withheld funds. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated the funding is a short-term safety net for the network's independent journalism. This move highlights the value Europeans place on the work of RFE and suggests a potential model for more stable, diversified funding in the future.</p>
