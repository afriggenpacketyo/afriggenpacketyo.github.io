        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of tyrannosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum, which they say alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. The 86-million-year-old skeletons belong to a species considered the closest known ancestor of tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery bridges the gap between small, fleet-footed predators and the larger, more formidable giants like T. rex. The species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features like strong jaws, which were crucial to the tyrannosaurs' dominance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is reportedly set to deny the majority of the 20,000 troops requested by the Department of Homeland Security for arresting migrants, raising concerns about potential violations of federal law. This decision follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. Hegseth and President Trump recently visited Fort Bragg, where Trump delivered a speech vowing to use military force to suppress "anarchy" and "liberate" Los Angeles. The limited troop deployment suggests a cautious approach by the Pentagon regarding the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

The judge stated there was no compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody, as he is a lawful permanent resident, and that his career, reputation, and speech are being irreparably harmed.
