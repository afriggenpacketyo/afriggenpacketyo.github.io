          <h2>China to Resume Seafood Imports from Japan After Fukushima Water Discharge Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 23:31:00 EDT</div>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports expected to resume once China completes necessary procedures. The deal is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan will register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities and provide inspection and certification of the seafood, confirming the absence of radioactive substances. The resumption of trade signifies a potential thaw in relations and reduced economic strain on Japanese seafood producers.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours with only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and used its helicopter to ferry rescuers to the scene, which was inaccessible by all-terrain vehicles. Morris was eventually freed by seven men using inflatable airbags and spent two nights in the hospital for observation. The survival story highlights the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of community support in emergency situations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an Oval Office press conference with Elon Musk to mark the end of Musk's official role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's government service is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. Despite his departure, Trump suggests Musk will continue to assist the administration. DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, although the initiative has faced criticism from Democrats in Congress.

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after crews spent nearly six weeks reinforcing tracks subject to landslides and coastal erosion. The rail line, serving Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, was closed in April for construction. Emergency construction was approved after several sections of the rail were deemed unstable, with crews placing thousands of tons of boulders and sand to stabilize potential runoff. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the total cost of the projects to be around $300 million, addressing recurring interruptions to passenger rail service. The resumption of service aims to provide reliable transportation.</p>
