          <p>Stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge of 30% in its Nasdaq debut after raising nearly $310 million through its initial public offering, pricing shares above the anticipated range. The Israel-based company sold almost six million shares at $52 each, valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed interest in the IPO market, particularly after delays caused by tariff concerns. eToro, founded in 2007, has seen substantial growth, especially in cryptocurrency trading, with net income increasing thirteenfold last year, however, they expect crypto assets to account for less of their commission from trading activities in the first quarter.</p>

The surge follows CEO Jensen Huang's announcement of a major AI chip sale to Saudi Arabia, potentially mitigating revenue headwinds from China restrictions. Analysts suggest this deal could offset billions in revenue losses tied to constraints on goods going to China, bolstering investor confidence in Nvidia's growth trajectory. With this recovery, Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, although it remains below its 52-week high from January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy can provide a financial reset by discharging most unsecured debts, but it comes with several limitations that individuals should consider. Not all debts are dischargeable, including child support, alimony, recent income taxes, and most student loans. Filers may have to surrender non-exempt assets, and co-signers on loans are not protected from collections. Rebuilding credit after Chapter 7 takes time and effort, as the bankruptcy remains on the credit report for 10 years, making it more difficult to rent an apartment, finance a car, or get a mortgage.</p>

          <p>Following recent radar outages at major airports, discussions have resurfaced regarding the technology's origins and advancements. The term "radar" is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging, a system that uses radio waves to detect objects. The concept dates back to the late 19th century, with German physicist Christian H√ºlsmeyer creating the Telemobiloskop in 1904 to prevent ship collisions. Radar became crucial during World War II, and today, modern aircraft rely on it to avoid collisions, however, some airports still rely on systems that use floppy disks and copper wire, highlighting the need for modernization and upgrades.</p>

          <p>Newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to transform the Bundeswehr into "the strongest conventional army in Europe" in his first major speech to parliament. He also announced plans to make Germany more competitive on the global stage, as well as a sweeping economic recovery package and a tough new migration policy. Merz emphasized Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion, but stressed that Germany was "not a party to war, and we don't want to become one."</p>

          <p>Uber is introducing "Route Share," a cheaper pooled rides option, and a price-lock pass for commuters, aiming to attract more daily users amidst rising costs. Route Share offers rides up to 50% cheaper than UberX during weekday commuting hours, while the price-lock pass allows passengers to lock in fares on as many as 10 distinct routes. These initiatives reflect Uber's strategy to compete with rivals like Lyft by offering diverse rideshare options to cater to various customer needs and budgets.</p>
