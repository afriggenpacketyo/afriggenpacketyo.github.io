          <p>Following golf pro Scottie Scheffler deleting his Venmo account due to unwanted activity, this article offers advice on safeguarding privacy on the payment platform. Venmo encourages users to decline payments or requests from strangers and to verify the legitimacy of requests from apparent friends or relatives outside of the app. Users can also adjust their privacy settings to limit transaction visibility to "Friends only" or "Private," with the latter being the most restrictive option, limiting visibility to only the parties involved in the transaction. This is important to avoid online scams and control the information shared publicly. The article highlights the importance of digital safety and managing online footprints.</p>
