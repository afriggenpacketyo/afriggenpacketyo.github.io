          <p>An author who identifies as a "Mad Scientist"—experiencing both high positive and high negative emotions—shares his daily protocol for managing intense negative feelings, particularly in the morning. The routine includes waking before dawn, physical exercise, metaphysical practice like prayer or meditation, and strategically timed caffeine and protein intake. The final step involves engaging in deep, creative work to achieve a state of "flow," which is psychologically rewarding and helps to establish a positive emotional balance for the day.</p>

          <p>In response to an unprecedented incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, several NATO allies are deploying additional military assets to the alliance's eastern flank. The Netherlands and the Czech Republic are sending air defense systems, artillery, and troops to Poland, while Germany is expanding its air policing mission. The incident, which involved the shooting down of at least three drones, has prompted Poland to call for a UN Security Council meeting and has been labeled a deliberate provocation by European leaders.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary inquiry has recommended banning social media access for children under 15 and imposing a "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18. The report was particularly critical of TikTok, describing it as a "production line of distress" that exposes young people to harmful and addictive content. These recommendations are part of a broader European trend to regulate children's access to online platforms, with similar measures being implemented or considered in Australia, Denmark, and Spain.</p>

          <p>The recent violation of Polish airspace by 19 Russian drones has prompted a rare display of unity between Poland's politically opposed president and prime minister. Both leaders have emphasized the need to act as "one fist" in the face of the threat from Russia, coordinating their response and calling for greater support from NATO allies. This shared sense of purpose has temporarily replaced the usual political infighting, as the nation confronts what its leaders call an unprecedented provocation and test of its security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare's "3-day rule" is a critical regulation that can determine whether post-hospitalization care is covered. The rule requires a beneficiary to have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days before Medicare Part A will pay for subsequent care in a skilled nursing facility. This distinction is crucial, as time spent in a hospital under "observation status" does not count toward the requirement, potentially leaving patients with thousands of dollars in unexpected out-of-pocket costs for their rehabilitation.</p>
