          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While Chevron's CEO celebrated the affirmation of corporate merger practices, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess. The resolution ends a period of uncertainty that had weighed on Chevron's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Olga Khazan's new book, "Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change," details her personal journey to overcome introversion and social anxiety. As a self-described introvert, Khazan decided to tackle her loneliness by enrolling in an improvisational comedy class, a concept that felt like "full-immersion insanity." The article recounts her initial discomfort with improv exercises like "Zip Zap Zop" and juggling invisible objects, contrasting the class's forgiving atmosphere with her high-pressure job. It frames her experiment as a deliberate effort to step outside her comfort zone to foster personal growth.</p>

          <h2>Delta and United Airlines Outpace Competitors Through Premium and International Focus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly distinguishing themselves from other major U.S. carriers, capturing over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to a strategic focus on premium cabins, lucrative loyalty programs, and expansive international networks, which have helped them weather a challenging market better than their rivals. While domestic airfare is falling and creating difficulties for other airlines, both Delta and United have seen strong revenue from their premium and international offerings. This strategic separation is positioning them as the dominant forces in the American airline industry for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, found a river landscape dramatically altered by time and the rise of railroads. Despite the changes and the squalor of the steamboats, he felt a profound sense of homecoming in the pilot house, a place he associated with ultimate freedom. The experience highlighted a central paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for his past.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Fall to Pre-Tariff Levels, University of Michigan Survey Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent University of Michigan survey indicates that U.S. consumer fears about high inflation have significantly subsided, with expectations falling back to levels seen before new tariffs were announced. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year forecast also declined. Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the outlooks remain above late 2024 levels. Overall consumer sentiment saw a slight increase, reaching its highest point since February, suggesting a cautious but stabilizing view of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 'no tax on tips' provision in President Trump's new bill has been enacted, but its implementation details and who qualifies remain unclear. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but a deduction of up to $25,000 on federal income tax for properly reported tips, and it is set to expire in 2028. Tax professionals are awaiting clarification from the IRS, expected in October, on which occupations are eligible, as some are already excluded. The legislation also raises questions about how the deduction will apply to workers who receive tips through apps like Venmo or from contract work, especially with changing reporting thresholds.

          <h2>Analysis Explores Whether Investors Should Shift from Gold to Silver Amid Surging Prices</h2>

          <p>With silver prices reaching their highest point in over a decade, this article examines whether precious metal investors should consider shifting their focus from gold to the more affordable alternative. It notes that while silver offers similar protections against inflation and a lower entry price, its value is not historically comparable to gold. The article suggests that a complete switch is likely unwise, but the current market provides a timely opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations. It reinforces the traditional advice of limiting such investments to a small portion of an overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated that it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-funded factories in Mexico will be excluded from the benefits of the USMCA trade agreement when it is reviewed next year. David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor at the Mexican Embassy in China, believes that any revisions to the deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting specific countries. This would mean companies might need to source more of their product locally to qualify for preferential treatment. The statement comes amid ongoing trade rivalry between the United States and China, which has raised questions about supply chain dependencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers. Industry experts note that kids' content is less expensive to produce and has greater longevity, as children watch shows repeatedly, which helps reduce customer churn. This high engagement is vital for profitability, as retaining subscribers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Major platforms like Disney, Netflix, and Paramount are leveraging their deep libraries of kids' content, while also partnering with YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to maintain audience engagement and discover new talent.</p>
