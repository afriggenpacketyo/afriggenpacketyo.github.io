          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the government's decision to restrict a key Whitehall internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Citing her own working-class origins, Gray argued that she benefited greatly from exposure to people from diverse walks of life and asked for the evidence supporting the change. The government contends the new policy will widen the talent pool and help the civil service better reflect the country, a position supported by some within her own party.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone is now supporting the idea of training some residents to stay and defend their properties during wildfires instead of universally mandating evacuations. This change acknowledges the reality that there are not enough firefighters to protect every home during major fire events. The department has created a community brigade to provide residents with the proper training and equipment, empowering them to help save their homes and neighborhoods when conditions permit.</p>

He playfully ribbed Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University coach, about the University of Alabama's recent stunning loss to Florida State. Tuberville quickly retorted that his former team, Auburn, had won their game, drawing laughs and providing a moment of levity during the formal event.</p>

          <p>Nearly 25 years after the 9/11 attacks prompted fortified cockpit doors, airlines are beginning to roll out a new, federally mandated safety feature: secondary barriers. These retractable gates block the entryway to the flight deck when the main door is open, preventing potential unauthorized access. The regulation requiring these barriers on all new aircraft is set to take effect next year, with airlines like Southwest, United, and American already taking delivery of planes equipped with the added layer of protection.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a civil lawsuit filed by a security guard who accused her of assault and battery. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that the rapper spat on her and cut her face with a fingernail during a heated argument at a Beverly Hills obstetrician's office in 2018. After a trial that drew significant public attention, the jury deliberated for only an hour before finding in favor of the Grammy-winning artist.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat fired by President Trump, can resume her duties at the agency. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of legal precedent. The ruling represents a significant judicial check on the executive branch's power over independent regulatory bodies and is seen as a victory for the agency's institutional independence.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. federal judge has ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of the harshest penalties sought by the Department of Justice. The company must end exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices and browsers and must also share some search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the government's demand that Google be forced to sell its highly profitable Chrome web browser.</p>

          <p>American filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council in a dispute over the ownership of Hopwood Hall, a historic stately home. DePree, who documented his seven-year effort to save the derelict building in a book titled "Downton Shabby," claims he fulfilled his obligations under an agreement that gave him the option to purchase the hall. The council argues he failed to meet the conditions, locking him out and prompting the legal action to declare him the rightful owner.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, shooting fountains of lava up to 330 feet into the air.

Currently, all volcanic activity is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and does not pose an immediate threat to any communities, offering a spectacular but safe display of nature's power.</p>

          <p>The landslide victory of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is seen as a significant shake-up in UK left-wing politics. His blunt, social-media-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other outspoken figures on its left flank. Polanski's rise could potentially fragment the left-wing vote further, as his political approach may appeal to the same voters being courted by figures like Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, can reduce the final amount by tens of millions more, significantly impacting the life-changing sum. (not investment advice)</p>
