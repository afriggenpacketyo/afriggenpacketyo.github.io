          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, consumers are exploring new methods for relief, including AI-powered negotiation tools. These platforms offer an automated, often lower-cost alternative to traditional debt relief companies by directly contacting creditors to request lower interest rates or settle balances. While they provide speed and personalized strategies, potential downsides include inflexibility with complex cases, the risk of scams, and a lack of regulatory oversight. This article weighs the benefits of these emerging technologies against the human expertise and legal protections offered by established debt relief firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sports broadcaster Erin Andrews is promoting the importance of early cancer detection after a routine check-up in 2017 led to a surprising cervical cancer diagnosis despite her having no symptoms. Because the cancer was caught early, it was successfully treated with two surgeries. Now a survivor, Andrews has partnered with Aflac for the "Check for Cancer" campaign, which encourages Americans to prioritize regular screenings and aims to increase screening rates by 10% over the next decade. She emphasizes that being proactive about health can be life-saving, especially as cancer rates rise among younger demographics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan nationals. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the administration's claim of a "predatory incursion" by the Tren de Aragua gang did not meet the law's criteria, which is intended for times of war or invasion. Legal advocates hailed the decision as a significant check on executive power and a victory for the rule of law. The ruling is the first of its kind from a federal appeals court on this issue.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes which savings vehicle would generate more income from a $25,000 deposit: a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. It calculates potential earnings over three, six, nine, and twelve months, showing that a high-yield savings account currently offers slightly better returns in most scenarios. However, it cautions that savings account rates are variable and likely to fall with expected Fed rate cuts, whereas a CD locks in a fixed rate, potentially making it a more secure choice for guaranteeing returns in a cooling rate environment.

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a vacant Federal Reserve Governor seat, affirmed his commitment to the central bank's independence and its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In his opening remarks to the Senate Banking Committee, Miran stated that monetary policy independence is critical for success, a position that contrasts with President Trump's frequent calls for lower interest rates. While Miran has previously criticized the Fed's stimulus policies, he pledged that his decisions, if confirmed, would be based on macroeconomic analysis and the long-term stewardship of the economy.</p>

          <h2>Research on Hurricane Katrina Survivors Reveals Phenomenon of Post-Traumatic Growth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, long-term studies of its survivors have highlighted a surprising psychological outcome known as post-traumatic growth. Researchers found that despite widespread PTSD and depression, a majority of survivors also reported positive personal changes, such as a greater appreciation for life, stronger relationships, and increased personal strength. This phenomenon, summarized by the adage "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger," was often reported by those who experienced the most severe trauma. The findings suggest that with adequate resources like social and financial support, communities can foster resilience and growth after catastrophic events.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is nearing U.S. approval for the first-ever daily pill for chronic weight management, an oral version of its popular injectable drug semaglutide. The company's head of R&D, Martin Holst Lange, stated the pill has shown weight loss results of up to 16.6%, comparable to the Wegovy injection, with a favorable safety profile. While the pill requires being taken on an empty stomach, the company believes its convenience will appeal to patients who dislike needles. The launch, expected in early 2026, could significantly expand the obesity treatment market.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on September 17, mortgage rates could begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are not directly dictated by the Fed's policy but are influenced by broader market expectations, and lenders often price in anticipated changes ahead of time. Historical patterns, such as the rate drop before a Fed cut last September, suggest a similar trend could occur again. Therefore, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance may see more favorable rates emerge in the days leading up to the Fed's meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Tim Cook's successful efforts to shield Apple from the most severe impacts of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts predict the company may still raise prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup. While Apple has managed its supply chain to mitigate costs, it has still incurred hundreds of millions in tariff expenses. A price hike could be attributed to rising component costs or implemented subtly by eliminating the entry-level storage option for Pro models, forcing consumers into a higher-priced tier. This would follow a trend of gradual price increases for various iPhone models in recent years.</p>
