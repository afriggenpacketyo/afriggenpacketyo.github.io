          <p>House Republicans moved forward with President Trump's budget package after conservative opposition initially stalled the bill. Negotiations led to some "minor modifications," according to Speaker Mike Johnson, allowing the bill to advance through the House Budget Committee. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term and increase spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. However, the bill still faces challenges from conservatives seeking stricter spending cuts and moderates concerned about state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal, but train service will resume on Tuesday. The four-day strike halted trains across New Jersey, impacting hundreds of thousands of commuters. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, involves concessions related to work rules that will offset wage increases.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidency after a challenging race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion initially gained momentum with a first-round victory fueled by discontent over annulled elections and alleged Russian interference. Dan secured 54% of the vote, emphasizing unity and change, while Simion attacked the EU and advocated for reduced aid to Ukraine. The election was marked by high diaspora voter turnout, particularly in Western Europe, where Simion garnered significant support.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing expectations and signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the Chinese economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, surpassing estimates, while fixed-asset investment rose 4.0% in the first four months. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in April, despite trade war concerns. Following a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives, trade-war fears have receded, leading to revised economic growth forecasts for China. (not investment advice)</p>
