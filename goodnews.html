          <p>China has announced the commencement of the world's largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which flows into India and Bangladesh as the Brahmaputra. The project, with an estimated investment of $167 billion, is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies, such as Power Construction Corporation of China. This development highlights a major push in China's energy and infrastructure sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining renewed momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota setting ambitious timelines for mass production by the end of the decade. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a transitional step, critics note persistent technological hurdles and high costs. The industry remains divided, as recent advancements in existing battery technologies are also narrowing the performance gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to their power hitting. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run in the first inning, and Will Smith added two solo homers, providing the offensive spark the team has recently lacked. Despite a slumping team batting average this month, the four total home runs in the game offered a much-needed boost. The win was slightly marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott, who left the game with a forearm issue and will undergo an MRI.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first wave of sanctions against individuals and companies involved in people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. The new measures will freeze assets and impose travel bans on gang leaders, equipment suppliers, and financial middlemen who facilitate illegal immigration. This strategy is a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to disrupt the crossings and "smash the gangs." The move comes amid rising numbers of small boat arrivals and increasing political pressure to address the issue.</p>

The announcement follows recent threats of "severe" sanctions against Russia by U.S. President Donald Trump if a ceasefire is not achieved. Previous negotiations in the same venue failed to produce a breakthrough in the more than three-year-long war. While the talks may focus on prisoner exchanges and a potential meeting between Zelensky and Putin, the Kremlin has downplayed expectations, stating the two sides remain "diametrically opposed."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The reforms come after a critical report from the public inquiry chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a deceased family member's estate and consulting on better recognition for psychological harm. Victims' groups have cautiously welcomed the move but noted some issues still require resolution.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a "silver lining" by forcing other nations and trading blocs to address their own protectionist policies. The piece suggests that the tariff crisis has prompted countries like Canada and China to begin dismantling long-standing internal trade barriers that have hindered their own economic potential. The author posits that this push for domestic economic liberalization could ultimately offset some of the negative impacts of the U.S. tariffs, exposing hypocrisy and encouraging freer commerce.

          <p>Officials in Texas have confirmed that most of the more than 160 people reported missing after the deadly July Fourth floods along the Guadalupe River are safe. The list of unaccounted-for individuals has been reduced to just three. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, with the majority of deaths occurring in Kerr County. Officials explained that the initially high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists who left the area without checking in after the disaster. This pattern of sharp revisions in missing-person counts is common in the aftermath of large-scale emergencies.</p>
