          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 11:22:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has formally approved the resignation of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who served since March 2020, becoming the longest-serving PM in the country's history. This move triggers the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers and is part of a significant government reshuffle aimed at recalibrating Ukraine's economic and defense strategies amidst the ongoing war. Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is widely expected to be appointed as the new prime minister. Shmyhal is reportedly being considered for the role of defense minister, further indicating a major strategic reorganization within the Ukrainian government.</p>

          <h2>Actress Emma Watson Receives Six-Month Driving Ban for Speeding</h2>

          <p>Actress Emma Watson, known for her role in the "Harry Potter" series, has been banned from driving for six months and fined approximately $1,400. The penalty was issued after she was caught driving 38 mph in a 30-mph zone in Banbury last July. A court heard that Watson, who did not attend the hearing, already had nine points on her license prior to this latest offense. Coincidentally, fellow "Harry Potter" actress Zoe Wanamaker was also given a six-month driving ban on the same day for a separate speeding violation, having been caught driving 46 mph in a 40-mph zone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposed seven-year budget of €2 trillion, starting in 2028, which includes a substantial increase in defense and space funding. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the proposal allocates €131 billion for these sectors, a fivefold increase from the current budget, as part of a new European Competitiveness Fund. This fund is designed to enhance investment and bolster the region's strategic autonomy. The budget, which also earmarks about 35% for climate and biodiversity initiatives, now requires approval from the European Parliament and EU member states, where it may be subject to further negotiations.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched an investigation into Mars, the manufacturer of M&Ms and Skittles, for alleged deceptive trade practices regarding its use of artificial food dyes. The investigation claims Mars is misleading consumers about the safety of these ingredients, which have been linked to negative health outcomes, and is failing to honor a 2016 pledge to remove them. Paxton's office noted that while Mars has stopped using these dyes in its European products, it continues to use them in the U.S. This action is part of a broader "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, which has also targeted other major food companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is set to ease some export restrictions on advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, a move seen by experts as a positive signal in high-level bilateral negotiations. The Commerce Department is reviewing license applications for Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 AI chips, which could resume sales to the Chinese market once approved. This development is part of a broader package of trade agreements and comes ahead of further talks between senior officials from both nations. Analysts suggest this represents a significant concession that could help de-escalate the protracted technology and trade standoff, moving towards more constructive G2-style negotiations.

          <p>Australian golfer Ryan Peake is making his major championship debut at The Open, a remarkable turn of events for a man who previously served a five-year prison sentence for serious assault. As a young man, he drifted away from a promising junior golf career and joined an outlaw motorcycle gang, a lifestyle that ultimately led to his incarceration. While in prison, he reconnected with his former coach and decided to rededicate himself to golf, believing it was a path to a better life. His comeback culminated in a victory at the New Zealand Open, which earned him a spot at Royal Portrush, completing a journey from a prison cell to one of golf's most prestigious events.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Gdańsk, Poland, have discovered the complete skeleton of a medieval knight buried beneath a site that once housed a popular ice cream parlor. The discovery was made after a limestone tombstone, engraved with the image of a knight and dating to the 13th or 14th century, was unearthed. The well-preserved skeleton, found just inches below the stone, belonged to a man estimated to be about 40 years old at the time of his death. Researchers are now conducting further analysis on the remains and the tombstone to learn more about the knight's identity and the historical context of his burial.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, reporting earnings of $2.13 per share against a forecast of $1.96. The bank's success was largely fueled by its Institutional Securities division, where strong client activity, particularly in equity trading, pushed revenues to $7.64 billion. The wealth management segment also performed robustly, contributing $7.76 billion in revenue due to higher asset management fees. CEO Ted Pick highlighted the consistent earnings over six consecutive quarters as evidence of the firm's ability to perform well across different market environments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of America reported mixed second-quarter results, beating earnings per share estimates but falling short on overall revenue. The bank's profit rose about 3% to $7.12 billion, or 89 cents per share, but its revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below expectations. A key factor was net interest income (NII), which, at $14.82 billion, missed analyst forecasts, as the benefits of loan growth were offset by lower interest rates compared to the previous year. While CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to resilient consumer spending and good momentum in markets, the NII miss distinguished BofA from other major banks that met revenue targets.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) be renamed "physician assistants" to better reflect their supportive role and avoid confusion with doctors. The review, commissioned after safety concerns were raised, also suggests PAs wear distinct uniforms and only see new patients with minor ailments after they have been triaged. This follows cases where patients died after being treated by PAs whom they believed were fully qualified doctors. The government has accepted all recommendations, aiming to provide clarity for patients, though the union representing PAs warns the new restrictions could lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>

The legislation, which has already passed the Senate, would create clear rules and consumer protections, allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins.
