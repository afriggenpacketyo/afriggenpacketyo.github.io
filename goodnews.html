        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics embarked on an official Holy Year pilgrimage in Rome, signaling a significant shift in their relationship with the Catholic Church. Participants celebrated a newfound sense of welcome, largely attributed to the inclusive tone set by the late Pope Francis. A high-ranking Italian bishop led a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing the Jubilee's historical purpose of restoring dignity to marginalized groups. This event stands in stark contrast to 25 years ago when a similar pilgrimage resulted in participants being detained, highlighting a major evolution in the church's approach.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a locked magnetic case, to enforce bans on student cellphone use in classrooms. As states like New York mandate phone-free learning environments, millions of students are now required to secure their devices upon entering school. While some students and educators praise the system for reducing distractions and encouraging social interaction, others have expressed frustration and attempted to bypass the pouches. The company behind the solution aims to create a culture change, helping students re-engage with their immediate surroundings.</p>

Launched in May 2024, the app is reportedly generating $1.4 million in gross profit monthly, with a team of 30 employees. Yadegari, who learned to code at age seven, developed the app to solve the tedious problem of manual calorie tracking. Now a freshman at the University of Miami, he anticipates leaving college early to focus on his rapidly growing business full-time.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its long-running anti-corruption campaign, extending its reach from the banking industry into the stock market. While the crackdown may not provide an immediate boost to market confidence due to current economic uncertainties, analysts believe it is a crucial step for long-term stability. By promoting cleaner governance and aligning with the standards expected by international institutions, Beijing aims to create a more attractive and trustworthy environment for foreign investors. The investigation of a high-level securities regulator underscores the seriousness of this latest phase of the campaign. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes, in South Carolina. After decades of searching, the discovery of the shallow battlefield graves provides a direct link to the conflict's human cost. Now, a team of forensic genealogists is working on what they call "the ultimate cold case," using advanced DNA analysis to build genetic profiles and identify the soldiers. The project aims to restore the names and stories of these forgotten individuals who were among America's first soldiers.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system on Sunday, September 7, at approximately 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening situations, such as extreme weather or terror attacks, by sending a message with a loud siren sound to all compatible mobile phones. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced several technical glitches, including some users not receiving the alert. Officials have provided instructions for those who wish to opt out, including advice for domestic abuse victims with secret phones.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a defeat against world number two, Canada, in a competitive pool-stage match.

          <p>An article by a Harvard-trained strategist analyzes the success of Taylor Swift, identifying seven key traits she consistently demonstrates that contribute to her achievements. These characteristics include imagination, synthesis of ideas, intense focus on core priorities, doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion, reverence for her craft, and unwavering commitment. The author suggests that Swift's success is not accidental but a result of cultivating these traits, such as her refusal to "dabble in things that aren't important" to her. These principles can serve as a model for others seeking to achieve their own goals.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy explains why she and her husband sold their properties and returned to renting, even though they could afford to buy a home with cash. She argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, including renovations, maintenance, and property taxes, which are often underestimated. Furthermore, being a landlord proved to be a stressful and time-consuming venture that offered less return than investing in the stock market. For her, renting provides greater financial freedom, flexibility, and the ability to focus on growing her business and net worth. (not investment advice)</p>

Model, known for her street photography, aimed to capture the full American experience of joy and pain reflected in the music. Her project, which was to include an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned due to McCarthy-era political suspicion. Her images are noted for capturing the inward wariness of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, who faced racism and persecution despite their fame, creating a poignant connection with the photographer's own experiences fleeing the Nazis.</p>
