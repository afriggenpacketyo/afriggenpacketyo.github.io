          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the right to freedom of expression of Esperanza Gómez, a porn star, when it deleted her Instagram account. The court found that Meta removed her account without a clear and transparent justification and inconsistently applied its policies on nudity. Meta argued that Gómez violated its rules on nudity, but the court noted that similar accounts remained active. The court ordered Meta to review and adjust its terms of use to ensure users are aware of moderation decision challenge mechanisms.
