          <h2>Artisanal Mezcal Gains Global Popularity, Boosting Fortunes of Oaxacan Family Distilleries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mezcal, a traditional Mexican spirit, is experiencing a surge in global demand, elevating it from a local drink to a premium product. The article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros in Oaxaca, who returned from the U.S. to expand their family's artisanal distillery, Mal de Amor. Their partnership with the Ilegal mezcal brand, now acquired by Bacardi, illustrates the industry's rapid growth while trying to maintain traditional, handcrafted production methods. The story chronicles the spirit's journey and the economic transformation it brings to local communities, and sadly notes the recent passing of the family patriarch.</p>

          <p>An AI-powered tutor named Khanmigo, developed by Khan Academy with OpenAI's technology, is being piloted in over 200 U.S. school districts. The tool acts as a Socratic-style learning assistant for students and helps teachers with lesson planning, saving them significant time. It is designed with guardrails to prevent cheating, instead guiding students to find answers themselves. The platform also includes a feature that can detect if a student is discussing self-harm and alert school staff, a function that has already been used to intervene. While still a work in progress, Khanmigo represents a potentially transformative technology for personalized education.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's performance is drawing strong comparisons to the peak dominance of Tiger Woods. The article analyzes how Scheffler has become the undisputed world number one, winning four majors in four seasons and demonstrating a machine-like consistency. Peers like Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele acknowledge him as the new benchmark in golf. The report also explores the technical aspects of his game, including his unorthodox swing and a crucial improvement in his putting after working with a specialized coach, which has transformed him into a nearly unbeatable force on the PGA Tour.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, teaching children self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs—is the single most important skill for a successful life. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their inner voice, leading to insecurity and anxiety. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and promotes authentic confidence. The author provides practical tips for parents, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and focusing on a child's intrinsic qualities rather than just their achievements.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces New Water Ombudsman to Address Consumer Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to establish a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaks and incorrect billing. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public criticism over rising bills and record levels of sewage discharge into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has set a target to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new ombudsman will have legal powers to protect customers, bringing the water sector's consumer protection in line with other utilities, though a timeline for its creation has not been set.</p>
