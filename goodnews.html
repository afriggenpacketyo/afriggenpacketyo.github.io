          <h2>US and UK Reach Trade Agreement Reducing Trump-Era Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that will reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the U.S. tariff-free. While leaders from both countries have hailed the agreement as significant, analysts suggest it may not substantially alter pre-existing trade terms. The deal will reduce tariffs on cars to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles annually and slash tariffs on steel and aluminum, with the two sides also agreeing to reciprocal access for beef exports. The agreement is viewed as a positive step, but some critics argue that it favors the U.S.</p>

The agreement, which is still being finalized, includes the reduction of tariffs on UK cars from 27.5% to 10% and the elimination of tariffs on steel and aluminum. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a boost to trade between the two countries and a creator of jobs.

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, including replacing technology at over 4,600 sites and building six new coordination centers.
