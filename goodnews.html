        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bags have significantly reduced shoreline litter in the U.S. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that regulations decreased plastic bag litter by 25% to 47% over six years. Fees on plastic bags appear more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, though further research is needed to understand why. The study underscores the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution, though complete elimination has not been achieved, highlighting the need for continued efforts.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dismissed charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester accused of assaulting border patrol agents during an immigration raid demonstration. Mojica claimed he was brutally attacked by law enforcement during the arrest, and video footage supported his account. The U.S. attorney's office stated the dismissal was "in the interest of justice," leading Mojica and his attorney to believe authorities recognized their error. Mojica's attorney hopes this dismissal is the first of many for protesters charged for exercising their constitutional rights. This outcome suggests a reevaluation of the charges brought against protesters.</p>

Temperatures are expected to peak at 33C on Saturday, and parts of the country may experience "tropical nights." Fire services are issuing water safety warnings, and health organizations are advising precautions for vulnerable individuals. The rising temperatures are attributed to high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" strips away traditional war film elements to focus on the existential drama of soldiers in the Civil War. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army as they carry out routine tasks in the Montana wilderness. Minervini's naturalistic style emphasizes a sense of place and the characters' states of being, with little combat and a focus on their internal struggles. The film subtly explores themes of economic inequality, brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague America. The work functions as an origin story for Minervini's exploration of an America still in conflict.</p>
