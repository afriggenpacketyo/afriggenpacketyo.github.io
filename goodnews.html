          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and lightheartedly dismissed recent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, they joked about the speculation, which arose after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama reiterated her commitment to their marriage, explaining her recent absences from public events as a personal choice to enjoy her newfound freedom. The couple, married since 1992, affirmed their strong bond, dispelling the unfounded gossip.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially triggering a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. The quake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, prompting coastal communities to heed evacuation alerts. Officials confirmed that a small tsunami was generated but did not expect widespread, destructive waves, as the event happened in shallow water. The region is part of the seismically active "Ring of Fire," and the event serves as a reminder of the area's geological volatility.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana. He visited the site with the HALO Trust, the same organization Diana worked with in 1997 to raise awareness for a land mine ban treaty. Harry emphasized the ongoing danger that land mines, remnants of a 27-year civil war, pose to local communities, particularly children. The HALO Trust has destroyed over 120,000 land mines in Angola but notes that a thousand minefields still require clearing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced via social media that he convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with real cane sugar in its cola sold in the United States. Trump praised the change as a "very good move," stating that the product will simply be better. In response, Coca-Cola did not directly confirm the switch but acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and stated that details about new product innovations would be shared soon. The company already uses cane sugar in its products in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new laws by the end of the year aimed at cracking down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The new legislation will make it explicitly illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to the UK, a necessary change since Brexit placed the UK outside existing EU rules. This move is expected to help German authorities dismantle smuggling operations, particularly those involving the storage and supply of small boats. The commitment is part of a broader new agreement on migration and defense between the two nations.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the earliest stages of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Space Telescope and other observatories, scientists detected the formation of silicate minerals, the building blocks of rocky planets. This discovery provides a look into a process similar to how our own solar system began billions of years ago. The finding is a significant milestone, offering researchers a real-time view of the "seeds of the planets" as they begin to coalesce from a disk of gas and dust.</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has demonstrated that creating embryos with DNA from three people can successfully prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. Researchers reported that eight children, born using this technique to families plagued by these rare genetic conditions, appear healthy. The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, effectively replacing the defective genetic material. While the results are hailed as a major breakthrough, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of germline genetic modification.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Beijing is making "big steps" to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This marks a significant shift in tone from his previous statements, where he has directly blamed China for the crisis and used it as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's comments come amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. He suggested that China is motivated to act, in part, because of the economic pressure from the tariffs he has implemented.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that would create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, making them less volatile and more suitable for payments. Supported by the crypto industry and the Trump administration, the legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. Proponents argue that regulation would foster innovation and allow for faster, lower-cost financial transactions. (not investment advice)</p>
