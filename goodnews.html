          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so, and the first time such a warning included the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air, and pushing it through the Chicago area. While skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, the event left residents in awe, describing it as something out of the history books.</p>
