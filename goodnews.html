          <p>Kroger's shares experienced a surge following the supermarket operator's announcement of raised full-year sales outlook, indicating a shift in consumer behavior towards seeking lower prices and opting for home-cooked meals. The company's identical sales, excluding fuel, are projected to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year over year, exceeding previous expectations. Interim CEO Ron Sargent highlighted the company's efforts to cater to value-minded shoppers through simplified promotions, reduced prices on over 2,000 products, and emphasis on private-label brands. Despite facing challenges such as a blocked acquisition and leadership changes, Kroger is adapting to evolving consumer preferences by focusing on value and expanding its private-label offerings (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, citing that he is not a threat to the community or a flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, causing significant distress to his pregnant wife who gave birth in April. The judge determined that Khalil's detention was "highly unusual" and that there was an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, referencing his leadership in student protests against Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. Despite the government's intention to appeal, the judge's decision is effective immediately, allowing Khalil to return home to his family. </p>

VW has already secured a deal with Uber, which intends to purchase up to 10,000 VW e-vans over the next decade. While Tesla also has plans for a robotaxi service, VW's move positions it as a strong contender in the emerging autonomous driving market. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 plaintiff states that argued the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge McConnell stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the ruling as "judicial activism" while California Attorney General Rob Bonta lauded the decision, accusing President Trump of coercing state and local governments into carrying out his immigration agenda. </p>

          <p>Savers are weighing the benefits of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts to maximize interest earnings in a changing rate environment. CDs offer fixed interest rates for a specific term, while money market accounts provide variable rates and greater access to funds. The article compares potential earnings on a $10,000 deposit in both types of accounts, noting that the interest-earning potential is similar, though it depends on the specific rates and terms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article humorously explores the trend of adding protein to nearly every type of food, from iced tea to peanut butter, driven by Americans' obsession with the nutrient. The author recounts their experience of consuming a protein-enriched dinner, highlighting the absurdity of the trend and questioning the necessity of such high protein intake for the average person. While protein is beneficial for muscle building and satiety, the article suggests that the food industry is exploiting the "healthy" association of protein to make products more appealing, even when it may not be necessary or even beneficial. The article questions whether protein-infused products are genuinely healthier or simply a marketing tactic. </p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Murkowski emphasized her commitment to communicating her concerns, particularly regarding the impact on Alaskan beneficiaries, given the state's high healthcare costs and reliance on Medicaid. While she hasn't set any absolute deal-breakers, Murkowski is wary of cuts that would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The reconciliation bill, which has passed the House, faces debate in the Senate, where some Republicans are pushing for deeper cuts. </p>
