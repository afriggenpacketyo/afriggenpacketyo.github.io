The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is scheduled for a historic splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, a new landing location chosen to ensure debris falls harmlessly. The crew, commanded by Anne McClain, completed a 148-day mission and performed a handover to their replacements, the Crew-11 astronauts who arrived six days prior. The mission marks a successful rotation and continued international cooperation in space.</p>

          <p>A strong personal bond has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. The two have connected over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and time spent at elite U.S. universities. Vance is currently visiting Lammy in the UK, a trip seen as part of a broader effort by the UK's Labour government to build relationships across the American political spectrum. This friendship highlights the importance of personal diplomacy, particularly as both men have previously made highly critical comments about Donald Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film “Shaman,” directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, offers a unique take on the demonic possession genre by grounding it in the ancestral traditions of the Ecuadorian Andes. The story follows two missionaries whose son appears to be possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual beliefs they had previously dismissed. Filmed on location near the Chimborazo volcano, the movie incorporates the Kichwa language and was made in close collaboration with the local Indigenous community. The film uses the Andean demon known as the Supay to provide a fresh, culturally specific perspective on exorcism and faith.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened a series of "warm-hearted convenience stores" as an innovative approach to fighting loneliness and social isolation, which have become significant issues in South Korea. These centers offer a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can get free food, such as ramen, and connect with social workers and other people. The initiative has been unexpectedly popular, attracting thousands of visitors, from unemployed young adults to isolated elderly individuals. The program aims to address the rising number of "lonely deaths" and the growing phenomenon of social withdrawal in a rapidly changing society.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to potentially allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to democratize retirement savings but introduces assets with higher risk profiles and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While these investments can offer higher returns, they also come with greater volatility and complexity, and it remains unclear how quickly employers will adopt them. Experts predict adoption will be slow due to concerns about cost, transparency, and fiduciary responsibilities under federal law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. Directed by Amy Berg, the film moves beyond the typical narrative of a doomed artist to explore the complexities of his personality, his creative process, and his struggles with sudden fame. Using archival material and interviews with close friends and family, the documentary paints a portrait of a turbulent but gifted artist. The article praises the film for dimensionalizing Buckley and resisting a simplistic story of inescapable fate.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, officially ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. U.S. President Donald Trump presided over the signing, which both foreign leaders credited to his diplomatic efforts. The agreement reportedly includes the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. This U.S.-brokered deal represents a major diplomatic development in the region and is seen as a sign of waning Russian influence in the South Caucasus.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell became a symbol of courage and calm leadership after an oxygen tank explosion crippled his spacecraft on its way to the moon in 1970, forcing a dramatic but ultimately safe return to Earth. He was also a crew member on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the moon. Lovell's life and career were praised by NASA for inspiring millions and turning a potential tragedy into a "successful failure" that provided invaluable lessons.</p>

          <p>Independent UK Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has issued an apology and a £1,000 charity donation after mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." The MP had posted a picture of the boat on social media, vowing to ensure the individuals were deported and alerting authorities. HM Coastguard confirmed the crew was, in fact, attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The rowers, which include a former Royal Marine, said they found the incident hilarious.</p>
