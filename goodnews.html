          <p>South Korea is poised to enter the global competition to develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). The technology KAI is showcasing, including 4.5-generation fighters and unmanned aerial vehicles, will become key elements in the transition. This move aligns South Korea with other nations like China and the United States, which are also pursuing sixth-generation fighter programs. KAI's display at the Paris Air Show included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, indicating a focus on crewed-uncrewed teaming.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing challenges in the Tokyo assembly election, a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Exit polls suggest that Tomin First no Kai, a regional party led by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to perform well among independent voters. The election is seen as a reflection of voter sentiment on national issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The LDP's performance in Tokyo often influences the national political landscape, signaling potential shifts in leadership and economic policy.</p>
