          <p>The UK, particularly South-east England and East Anglia, is expected to experience temperatures reaching 26-27C on the last day of spring. There's a possibility of temperatures rising to 29C in some areas, potentially surpassing the year's highest temperature recorded on May 1st. The weather will be warm and humid across England and Wales, with eastern counties of England likely to have the highest temperatures. Spring has already been confirmed as the sunniest on record, with temperature and rainfall levels near record-breaking levels as well, marking a notable end to the season.</p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2bn upgrade. Initially drawn up in 1990, the project aimed to improve travel times and bring prosperity to a deprived area. The upgrade involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including bridges and junctions, and planting 285,000 trees to offset environmental impact. The final stretch was financed using the Mutual Investment Model, with the Welsh government paying over ¬£40m annually for 30 years for maintenance until 2055; the project has faced criticism over its cost and delays.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that the United Nations may be undercounting the world's population by hundreds of millions, or even billions, due to incomplete census data in rural areas. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, others argue that these anxieties reflect power struggles over who is considered a burden or threat. The article discusses historical perspectives on population growth and control, including coercive policies in India and China. It concludes that managing consumption responsibly and developing sustainable technologies are crucial for avoiding environmental catastrophe, and that concerns about population are often rooted in biases about certain groups of people.</p>

These gatherings, which are relatively inexpensive to run, offer a sense of community and reduce social isolation.

As federal health funding faces potential cuts, organizers believe memory cafes will become even more critical in providing affordable care and support.</p>
