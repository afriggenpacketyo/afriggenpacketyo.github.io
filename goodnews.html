          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, his family is advocating for the preservation of George Floyd Square in Minneapolis as a historic site. The family envisions a pedestrian plaza with a memorial, shops, and a library to revitalize the area and honor Floyd's legacy. However, disagreements persist between city council members, the mayor, and business owners regarding the square's future, with debates focusing on restricting traffic versus reopening bus routes to support local businesses. The tension highlights the complex balance between commemoration and economic recovery in the aftermath of tragedy, as well as the need to address systemic violence.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert has developed a new framework called 'emotionally safe parenting,' which emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach encourages parents to accept their child's emotions without judgment, view challenging behavior as a signal for support, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control. Emotionally safe parenting also involves self-awareness and inner healing for the parents, creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing themselves authentically. By focusing on emotional safety, parents can help their children thrive and build healthy relationships.</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change military protocol regarding casualty notifications. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams sent to families during the Vietnam War, Moore advocated for in-person notifications by service members. Moore worked with the local Western Union office to receive calls about telegrams and would rush to comfort the widows. Her actions led to the Army adopting a new policy of personal notifications and support for grieving families, and she is honored at Ft. Moore, formerly Ft. Benning.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris won the Monaco Grand Prix, leading from pole position and managing both pit-stop periods effectively. The race, which began with uncertainty due to a new rule aimed at increasing jeopardy, turned out to be relatively straightforward for the front-runners. Verstappen, who started at a disadvantage, finished fourth after a late pit stop, as the race was only briefly interrupted by a virtual safety car on the first lap. Norris, Leclerc and Piastri all followed the same strategy of starting on the medium tyre followed by two stints on the hard.</p>
