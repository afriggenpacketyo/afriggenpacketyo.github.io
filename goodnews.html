          <h2>Chinese Exporters Utilize Letters of Credit to Target Domestic Market Amid Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has implemented measures to support Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One strategy involves promoting the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs), which serve as a guarantee to sellers that payments for goods or services will be made on time. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, offer payment security and enhance credit, addressing key concerns for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can be used for both physical goods and services.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's export restrictions, with experts suggesting it could become an alternative for partners like the U.S. The world has been grappling with a rare earths shortage due to China's curbs, affecting auto manufacturers in India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Indian officials are considering leveraging India Rare Earths to increase rare earth magnet production, and India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%.</p>

          <p>An expert with the World Gold Council stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, noted that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold and should not be marketed as "gold 2.0" due to their different characteristics. His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow alongside a fresh rally in gold prices.</p>

          <p>Google Cloud experienced significant global outages, disrupting services for OpenAI, Shopify, and other major internet platforms. The outages, which began in the morning, affected multiple GCP products across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, causing problems for 13 of Google's cloud services. While Google engineers worked to restore service, major customers like Shopify and OpenAI reported issues with their services. Cloudflare also reported intermittent failures, though its core services continued to operate normally. Google later confirmed that all services were fully restored and apologized for the disruption.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the United States has continued to increase, reaching nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the CDC. The report also indicated a rise in the average age of first-time mothers, climbing from 26.6 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2023. Experts attribute this trend to various factors, including changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the increasing cost of raising children. The report also highlighted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023.</p>
