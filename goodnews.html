        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack criticized what she views as left-wing fearmongering after hospital staff hesitated to administer necessary drugs during her ectopic pregnancy due to the state's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, had to show staff the state law to prove her treatment was legal. She believes pro-abortion groups have created unnecessary fear around medical procedures related to pregnancy. Cammack hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups, advocating for women's healthcare regardless of party affiliation.</p>
