          <p>As a U.S.-Russia summit is set to take place in Alaska, this article revisits the historical context of the territory's sale in 1867. Facing financial strain after its defeat in the Crimean War, the Russian Empire under Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million. At the time, the resource-depleted territory was seen as a liability, and the sale was a strategic move to gain cash and a new ally. The deal, initially mocked in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," was later vindicated by the discovery of gold and oil, turning it into one of history's greatest bargains and leaving a lasting Russian cultural footprint, such as Orthodox churches, in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer price inflation slowed for the ninth consecutive month, reaching 1.55% in July, a level not seen since June 2017 and below analysts' expectations. The decline was primarily driven by falling food prices, which provides the Reserve Bank of India with more flexibility for a looser monetary policy to support economic growth. This easing inflation comes as India faces significant trade pressures, including U.S. tariffs on its goods for purchasing Russian oil. The benign inflation outlook, supported by healthy crop sowing and food grain stocks, may help the Indian economy navigate these external challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Spain have dismantled a criminal organization that operated a "spiritual retreat" offering clients dangerous substances, including the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca and toxic frog venom known as Kambo. The group allegedly charged participants over $1,160 for multi-day stays at a villa, promising mystical experiences and health benefits. The investigation began after a victim filed a complaint, leading police to uncover a sophisticated online operation that attracted clients from around the world. Police arrested three suspected leaders and seized various substances, highlighting the risks associated with unregulated alternative therapies.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old springer spaniel named Maple is helping Michigan State University researchers combat a disease threatening honeybees. After retiring from a career detecting human remains, Maple was trained to identify American foulbrood, a deadly bacterial disease that kills honeybee larvae and can devastate entire colonies. Wearing a custom protective bee suit, Maple uses her detection skills to screen hives, providing a crucial tool for beekeepers. This innovative project aims to mitigate one of the many threats facing pollinators, such as disease and climate change, and has also given a high-energy working dog a new sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>This opinion article counters recent calls for Los Angeles to withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympic Games, arguing that the city's successful history with the event is too meaningful to abandon. The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent meeting with President Trump as a necessary political maneuver to ensure the event's success for the good of the city. Citing the profitable and celebrated 1932 and 1984 Games, the piece emphasizes that the Olympics transcend politics and become a celebration of athletic achievement. The author urges Angelenos to rise above political divisions and support what could be a third triumphant Olympic hosting for the city.</p>

          <p>The pop-punk band Good Charlotte has returned with a new album, "Motel Du Cap," following a four-year hiatus that ended with a high-profile performance at Sofia Richie's wedding in France. The event, a family affair as frontman Joel Madden is married to Richie's sister Nicole, re-energized the band and led to the new record. Brothers Joel and Benji Madden, now 46, reflect on their evolved perspective, balancing family life with their music careers amidst a broader pop-punk revival. The new album, released on a label run by Richie's husband, explores themes of family and devotion, blending their classic sound with mature introspection.</p>

          <p>The Netflix crime drama "Adolescence" is gaining Emmy buzz for its ambitious cinematography, which films each episode as a single, continuous shot to create a deeply immersive experience. The article details the technical complexity of the second episode, which follows detectives through a mazelike school as they investigate a murder. This required meticulous choreography, three weeks of rehearsal, and innovative use of a lightweight Ronin 4D camera. The continuous-shot technique aims to mirror the characters' real-time emotional journeys, making the audience feel as if they are living the events alongside them and preventing the story from feeling like a gimmick.</p>

          <p>This article presents a subjective list of standout television moments from the 2024-25 season that are unlikely to be recognized at the official Emmy Awards. Among the highlights are the clever use of Easter eggs in "The Gorge," which referenced its stars' previous hit projects, and the suspenseful use of a firearm in an elevator in "Squid Game." The piece also praises the Netflix series "Dept. Q" for its masterful use of misdirection, which twice shocked audiences in its pilot episode. These alternative "Envy Awards" celebrate the quirky, thrilling, and innovative scenes that made a lasting impression on viewers beyond traditional award categories.</p>

          <p>Several of this year's Emmy-nominated television shows successfully kept major plot twists under wraps, a significant achievement in the age of internet spoilers. Series like "Paradise" and "Only Murders in the Building" used careful planning, NDAs, and controlled script distribution to protect their biggest surprises, from revealing a secret underground bunker to the unexpected return of a murdered character. Producers and actors from shows including "Severance" and "The Diplomat" discuss the nerves and security measures involved in preserving these shocking moments. The article highlights how these efforts allowed audiences to experience the full impact of the narrative turns as intended by the creators.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Josephine Lee, the 33-year-old model and artist known by her online alias, Princess Gollum. Lee created the persona to merge the two sides of her identity: a princess-like sensibility and a darker, more complex nature. The name allows her to express a more extreme version of her personality, fueling her creative work as a model, DJ, and visual artist. Lee discusses how her style has evolved from experimental to more refined and how she uses fashion, particularly her signature oversize sunglasses, as a form of armor to navigate the world. Her story explores the bridge between online identity and real-life expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in their trade war. The move, announced just hours before the previous deadline, keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 10%. President Trump's executive order acknowledged that China was taking steps to address American concerns, setting the stage for further negotiations and a potential summit between the two leaders later this year. Analysts believe the extension provides stability for consumers and businesses while both sides work toward a more comprehensive trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Swiss bank UBS, global investors are increasingly allocating capital to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as they seek alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This trend is part of a broader de-dollarization movement, with institutional investors like central banks and pension funds driving the renewed interest. Foreign holdings in yuan-denominated bonds rebounded to $587 billion as of May, up from a low in 2023. Beijing has facilitated this shift by simplifying procedures for foreign investment, and major global bond indices have been incorporating Chinese bonds, further integrating the market into the global financial system.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he would be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested a deal could be made if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%, and mentioned an upcoming meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This development follows a deal where Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China for export licenses. The move could reshape U.S. tech policy, potentially allowing American firms to maintain a presence in the Chinese market with modified technology. (not investment advice)</p>
