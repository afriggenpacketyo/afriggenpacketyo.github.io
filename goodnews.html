        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their original trials were unfair, leading to the quashing of their sentences related to the major financial crisis-era scandal. Hayes, who served five and a half years of an 11-year sentence, described the ordeal as having "destroyed" his family and life. Following this ruling, which aligns with US courts that found no evidence of lawbreaking, other traders convicted in the UK are expected to seek similar exoneration.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector saw a massive influx of capital in the first half of the year, with startups raising $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major players like OpenAI and Anthropic secured historic funding rounds, indicating strong investor confidence in the technology's potential. However, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized in the same period. This disparity suggests that while vast sums are being invested into developing AI applications, investors are seeing limited returns so far, with most exits being smaller, strategic acquisitions.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 06:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has approved bipartisan legislation that could allow more people to access high-risk investments, such as private equity and hedge funds, by passing a test rather than meeting wealth thresholds. Currently, "accredited investor" status is generally limited to individuals with high incomes or a net worth over $1 million. The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to create an exam to qualify investors based on financial knowledge instead of wealth alone. While proponents argue this creates equal opportunity, some financial advisors express concern that it could expose less financially secure individuals to unsuitable risks.

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on a beach in Scotland's Orkney Islands has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied history. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being repurposed as an Arctic whaling vessel. Researchers used dendrochronology and archival evidence, supported by a significant community effort from the island's 500 residents, to uncover its identity. The 12-ton oak timbers, uncovered by a storm after 250 years, are now being preserved, highlighting a powerful collaboration between scientists and the local community.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having recently cut interest rates, savers are encouraged to find competitive rates for their funds, with money market accounts (MMAs) presented as a strong option. These accounts offer interest rates comparable to high-yield savings, with some paying over 4% APY, while also providing liquidity features like debit cards or check-writing. As further rate cuts are anticipated in 2025, the article suggests that now may be an opportune time to lock in the currently elevated rates. MMAs are highlighted as a safe, FDIC-insured option for short-term goals and emergency funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues for a shift in wildlife management from fear-driven lethal control to evidence-based coexistence with predators like wolves and bears. The author contends that while isolated incidents of livestock predation are emotionally charged, they are statistically rare and often sensationalized, skewing public perception and policy. The piece highlights the ecological importance of predators as keystone species and points to the high success rate of nonlethal deterrents, which reduce conflicts by an average of 91%. The author calls for greater investment in these proven nonlethal methods, suggesting the current focus on eradication is ecologically damaging.</p>

          <p>The FireAid benefit concert, which raised $100 million for Southern California wildfire relief, has proven to be a crucial lifeline for affected communities, yet the scale of the recovery remains immense. Six months after the disaster, organizations that received funds report that the aid has been vital for providing immediate cash, food, and shelter, as well as longer-term support for mental health and navigating bureaucracy. However, the deep needs of a scarred Los Angeles persist, with high living costs compounding the challenges for displaced residents. The funds have been thoughtfully dispersed, but all stress that recovery requires sustained investment.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a major trade deal that will lower U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods, including vehicles and auto parts, from 25% to 15%. President Trump hailed the agreement as potentially the "largest trade deal in history," while Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted it was the lowest tariff rate among countries with a trade surplus with the U.S. In return, Japan has reportedly agreed to a $550 billion investment in the U.S. and will open its markets to certain American products. However, U.S. automakers have criticized the deal, as it leaves tariffs on imports from their suppliers in Canada and Mexico at a higher rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling"—super-chilling a home during off-peak hours—is gaining attention, but its effectiveness is debated. The method involves lowering the thermostat significantly when energy is cheaper and letting the accumulated coolness ride out hotter, more expensive peak hours. While some utilities and researchers see potential benefits if a home is well-insulated, others warn it can lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. Experts agree that other measures, like keeping curtains closed and maintaining AC systems, are reliable ways to improve efficiency.</p>

This policy is a key component of China's "dual circulation" strategy to boost domestic consumption and could position Hainan as a buffer in the ongoing trade war. Goods with over 30% value-added processing in Hainan will also be permitted to be sold tariff-free to mainland China.</p>

          <p>New DNA analysis of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey provides strong evidence of a female-centered, or matrilineal, society. Researchers examining 131 skeletons buried under houses found that related individuals were often connected through their mother's side, indicating that men moved in with the woman's family. This confirms long-held archaeological hunches based on female figurines found at the site. Further evidence, such as female graves containing significantly more grave goods than male ones, points to women holding an elevated status in one of the world's oldest inhabited places.</p>
