          <p>The White House announced that the United States has reached a trade deal with China after two days of negotiations in Switzerland, though China has yet to comment. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated the deal would help resolve the national emergency related to the trade deficit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that substantial progress had been made but stopped short of touting a full deal. This follows President Trump's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, the first in a series of anticipated agreements.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo defended owner Evangelos Marinakis' post-match intervention following a draw against Leicester, attributing it to confusion over a substitution. The conversation was sparked by frustration over a player being unable to continue after a substitution was made. Nuno praised Marinakis' passion and commitment to growing the club, stating that his involvement pushes the team to improve. He highlighted the owner's desire to make Forest a big club, which is why the owner intervened in the first place.</p>

          <p>Washington struck an optimistic tone following two-day trade negotiations with China in Geneva, with US officials citing "progress." US President Donald Trump's top economic and trade advisors have taken to the airwaves to announce that everything is going according to plan and the president's unorthodox approach to trade negotiations is working. The talks come after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on China ‚Äî which Beijing responded to with 125% tariff on US goods ‚Äî amid a global onslaught designed to reset perceived US trade imbalances around the world.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar to be used as Air Force One, according to sources familiar with the planning. The lavish gift, a Boeing 747-8 jet valued at roughly $400 million, is likely to raise legal and ethical questions. The administration will retrofit the plane for Trump's official use, and it is set to be transferred to his presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second term. This move comes amid delays and budget overruns in modernizing existing Air Force One aircraft.</p>

          <p>Last night‚Äôs episode of Saturday Night Live offered up a sketch that doubled down on a stereotype, then tripled down, then quadrupled down. The show had an opportunity to push back against the stereotype that middle-aged women, and mothers in particular, are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves. What could have been a refreshingly expansive view of motherhood instead ended up feeling retrograde. The undeniable undercurrent was: Watch out for moms who think about sex‚Äîand be sure to shut them down.</p>
