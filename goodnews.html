          <h2>OpenAI Employees Face Obstacles in Donating Equity Amid Rising Valuation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly facing difficulties in donating their equity to charity despite the company's soaring valuation. Employees receive profit participation units (PPUs) that cannot be transferred without company approval, hindering their ability to make charitable donations. OpenAI has resisted loosening restrictions on equity transfers, citing the need to maintain control over the shareholder base. The company spokesperson stated that OpenAI is not singling out philanthropic donations, and is just practicing good governance. Equity donations via donor-advised funds (DAFs) are a major consideration at high-valued startups because salaries tend to be modest, and a significant portion of an employee's net worth is wrapped up in their options or stock holdings. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased from recent highs following President Trump's announcement of plans to escalate the trade war. Investors are worried about the potential impact of Trump's tax bill, which is expected to increase the fiscal deficit. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating has further amplified these concerns, raising questions about the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The Supreme Court's suggestion of greater protection for Federal Reserve board members provided some positive news, easing fears about the potential removal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. </p>

          <p>Hawaii has passed legislation to increase the state's tax on tourists by 0.75%, with the funds earmarked for climate change protection and natural disaster prevention. The governor intends to sign the bill, calling it a commitment to protecting the land. The new tax is partly a response to the devastating wildfires in Maui in 2023. The governor believes that the additional 0.75% will likely not deter tourists from vacationing in Hawaii, noting that the tax will go towards efforts like ‚Äúkeep[ing] the beaches perfect‚Äù and preserving many of the natural sites that tourists flock to. </p>

          <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first China-invented painkiller, Qamzova, designed as a non-opioid alternative. Developed by Delova, the medication offers 24-hour pain relief through a single daily injection. Clinical trials showed it was effective in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. By providing a safer, long-acting treatment for moderate-to-severe pain, Qamzova directly addresses the US overdose epidemic fuelled by addictive opioids, including fentanyl. </p>

          <p>Coinbase Global has become the first cryptocurrency company to join the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial Services. While crypto enthusiasts celebrate this inclusion, critics express concerns about the potential risk of adding crypto to the portfolios of everyday Americans. Some industry watchdogs are now warning that the mainstream adoption of crypto is "a disaster courting a catastrophe." However, Coinbase represents a safer, more regulated way for investors to get exposure to crypto without buying cryptocurrencies directly. (not investment advice)</p>
