          <h2>New UK Government Guidance Mandates Anti-Misogyny Education in Schools</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 06:01:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidance for relationships, sex, and health education, requiring schools in England to teach students how to recognize and combat misogyny. The curriculum will emphasize identifying positive male role models and understanding topics like incel culture, AI-generated sexual imagery, and the link between pornography and misogyny. Unlike previous proposals, the new rules will not impose strict age limits for specific topics, instead providing a framework for what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. The move aims to address harmful attitudes and behaviors among boys and young men.</p>

          <p>Amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and a potential shift in U.S. security commitments under President Trump, France is emerging as a potential leader in Europe's push for "strategic autonomy." President Macron has announced significant increases in defense spending, aiming to double the budget between 2017 and 2027. The country's robust defense industry, which has maintained a "war culture" and expertise since the 1960s, is seen as the backbone of the continent's rearmament. However, France faces challenges, including sourcing raw materials, training specialists, and managing high public debt while funding this expansion.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Launches Model Y in India with High Price Tag Amid Steep Import Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries like the U.S. The steep price is largely due to India's 70% tariff on EV imports and a luxury tax, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market competitors. Analysts suggest this is a "soft launch" for Tesla to "test the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market without committing to local manufacturing yet. The company's success may depend on future changes to India's EV policies and import duties.</p>

          <p>Left-arm spinner Liam Dawson has been called into the England squad for the fourth Test against India, marking a potential return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old replaces off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who is out for the rest of the series with a broken finger. Dawson's selection comes as a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion provides England with a like-for-like replacement and strengthens the lower-order batting, offering a crucial option as England leads the series 2-1.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new scheme offering grants of up to £3,750 to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs). The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move, critics and consumers point to the UK's insufficient charging infrastructure as a major barrier to widespread EV adoption. Many households without private driveways face significant challenges in charging their vehicles, a problem the grants alone do not solve.</p>

This development is part of a broader trend where mainland financial institutions with international operations are seeking licenses in Hong Kong. The city is positioning itself as a digital asset hub, responding to growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During an interview at the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, President Donald Trump humorously suggested he could issue an executive order to officially change the name of "soccer" to "football" in the United States. While the comment appeared lighthearted, it signals his recent engagement with the sport, which is predominantly called football outside of North America. Trump was present as the English club Chelsea won the tournament, appearing with the team as they lifted the trophy. The newly expanded tournament, hosted across the U.S., aims to increase the sport's profile in the country.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "The Dry Season," author Melissa Febos chronicles her decision to take a year-long break from sex and dating at age 35 to reset her relationship with intimacy. Initially planned for three months, the period of celibacy helped her realize how much energy she had devoted to romantic pursuits, which she was able to redirect toward her creative work, friendships, and self-discovery. Febos found that withdrawing from sex made other aspects of life more sensual and helped her develop a more authentic connection with herself. She credits the experience with enabling her to build the healthy, honest long-term partnership she is in today.</p>

Defensively, they have conceded more goals, primarily due to the tough opening match, but have since shown significant improvement.
