          <p>The ancient archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, dating back nearly 12,000 years, has become a focal point for conspiracy theories popularized on platforms like Joe Rogan's podcast. Theorists, such as Graham Hancock, speculate it was built by a lost advanced civilization, a claim lacking empirical evidence. Archaeologists leading the excavation, like Lee Clare, push back against accusations of hiding discoveries, explaining that their slow, methodical approach is essential to preserve the fragile site for future research. The article highlights the tension between scientific archaeological practice and the rapid, widespread dissemination of misinformation that risks obscuring the site's true historical significance.</p>

          <p>In Pasadena, a group of teachers, retirees, and other activists have formed a citizen brigade to protect day laborers from federal immigration raids at a local Home Depot. Volunteers patrol the parking lot, alert workers to the presence of agents, and hold rallies to pressure the store into refusing cooperation with ICE. The movement was sparked by recent raids at other locations, which critics argue violate a court order preventing agents from using racial profiling. This grassroots effort reflects a growing local resistance to the administration's immigration crackdown, with participants motivated by what they describe as the inhumane and unjust nature of the enforcement actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Korea has been observed dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea, according to Seoul's military. This action is viewed as a reciprocal gesture following South Korea's decision in June to halt its own broadcasts as part of President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to ease tensions and reopen dialogue. The loudspeakers have historically been a tool of psychological warfare, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news, and the North emitting noise. The move signals a potential de-escalation in inter-Korean relations, which had recently been at a low point.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has finalized the signing of 22-year-old striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig in a deal valued at £73.7 million. The Slovenia international has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major attacking acquisition this summer. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, is known for his impressive pace and goal-scoring record, having netted 39 goals in 87 games for Leipzig. His arrival at Old Trafford raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom the club is reportedly willing to sell.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed 2-mile single-span suspension bridge is projected to cost €13.5 billion and is slated for completion in 2032. Proponents, including the construction firm Webuild, tout the project's potential for economic prosperity and job creation. However, the plan faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone, concerns about wind and corrosion, and strong opposition from local residents who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>This article offers etiquette advice for being a considerate houseguest, emphasizing that even with close friends or family, respect for their space is paramount. Etiquette expert Elaine Swann suggests keeping visits to around four days, communicating plans in advance, and never assuming your host can provide transportation. Being told to "make yourself at home" is a cue for self-sufficiency, not a license to be messy or overly demanding. A thoughtful host gift, tidiness, and offering to help with chores are key to ensuring you get invited back, fostering the positive experience of staying with loved ones.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby. While an injury and coaching changes at the Jaguars were factors, his decision was also influenced by growing opportunities back in rugby, including a potential spot on the Wales national team and interest from a proposed rebel league. Experts suggest that despite his athleticism, the technical and tactical learning curve in the NFL was immense. Rees-Zammit is expected to return to rugby as a more mature player, with his experience praised as a brave chapter rather than a failure.</p>
