          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders shared the advice his father, Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders, gave him while battling bladder cancer this spring. Deion, who is now cancer-free after surgery to remove his bladder, urged his sons to focus on their own careers rather than worrying about him. Shedeur noted the challenging time, which included his own fall in the NFL draft, but emphasized his father's resilient mindset. He is currently focusing on his development at the Browns' training camp and wants to earn his place without distractions.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a defense deal valued at approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks Japan's first major warship export since before World War II and represents a significant tightening of the strategic partnership between the two nations. This purchase is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion in the Indo-Pacific. The first three frigates will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste in local landfills. The lawsuit followed a multi-year investigation that found corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from UPS facilities were being sent to landfills not equipped to handle them. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs to address the issue. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursements, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>Southern California residents are more likely to see tarantulas as the spiders' mating season, which runs from late summer into fall, is now underway. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows and can travel long distances in search of mates, making them more visible in areas like the Santa Monica Mountains, Joshua Tree, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Experts advise that while the spiders can be intimidating, they are generally harmless to humans unless provoked. Their primary defense mechanism is flicking irritant hairs from their bodies rather than biting.</p>

          <p>Wealthy businessman and first-time political candidate Stephen J. Cloobeck is launching a $1.4 million television advertising campaign for his bid in California's upcoming gubernatorial election. The significant ad buy will run across major California markets as well as in New York City and Washington, D.C., aiming to boost his name recognition in a crowded field. Cloobeck, a conservative Democrat and prolific party donor, made his fortune in the timeshare industry. The move represents one of the first major media pushes in a race that currently lacks a clear front-runner.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to join President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position on the council. The council is being re-established as part of a broader initiative that also brings back the Presidential Fitness Test for schools. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both President Trump and former President Barack Obama, has emphasized his respect for the office of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, in a cave system in the Yorkshire Dales region of England. The find was made as part of the Ingleborough Cave Archaeology Project, which also uncovered evidence of human burials from the Neolithic period. This discovery provides new insights into the prehistoric farming and rituals of people who lived in the area thousands of years ago. The project highlights the crucial role that recreational cavers play in uncovering archaeological evidence in hard-to-access underground locations.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45-49 is leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. The findings follow recommendations from 2018 and 2021 that lowered the suggested screening age from 50 to 45. One study showed a 62% increase in screenings for this age group between 2019 and 2023. While researchers called the trend promising, they noted that screening rates for younger adults remain suboptimal and that access to testing is not equitable across different education and insurance levels.</p>

Ambler stated that the changes, which were prompted by her family's tragedy and other fatal shootings, make her feel that her campaign has been heard.
