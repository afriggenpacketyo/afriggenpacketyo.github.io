        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a significant and sustained decrease in fatal drug overdoses in the United States, reaching the lowest point in five years. This trend, which began in mid-2023, contrasts sharply with the Trump administration's continued portrayal of the fentanyl situation as a worsening crisis. The administration has enacted policies such as mandatory minimum sentences based on this narrative. Public health experts have criticized these tactics, suggesting they are misguided in light of the actual data showing considerable improvement in overdose mortality rates across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Across Europe, countries are re-evaluating their policies on military conscription in response to heightened geopolitical tensions. Germany, which ended compulsory service in 2011, is introducing a new model that requires 18-year-old men to register for potential service, with the possibility of making it mandatory if volunteer numbers are insufficient. Other nations like Sweden and Latvia have already reinstated conscription, while countries such as France and the UK are focusing on expanding their reserve forces. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the varying approaches, from Finland's deeply embedded system to Poland's significant military expansion.</p>

          <p>Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is set to join German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan, a deal that includes an option for a permanent transfer. The German champions will pay an initial loan fee of £13 million for the 24-year-old Senegal international, with a future purchase option valued at £56.2 million. Jackson's playing time at Chelsea became limited following the arrival of new signings during the summer transfer window. The move offers him an opportunity for more consistent first-team football after he was an unused substitute in Chelsea's recent matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has delivered a significant legal blow to the Trump administration's trade policies. The court upheld a lower panel's decision, ruling that the president does not have the unilateral authority to modify the nation's tariff schedules without congressional approval. This judgment challenges the legal foundation of several tariffs imposed by the administration. The ruling creates a direct conflict over executive power in trade policy and is expected to be appealed, potentially setting up a major showdown at the Supreme Court to clarify the president's powers in this domain.</p>

          <p>A global regulatory push to protect children online is spurring the development and adoption of AI-driven safety technologies. Laws such as the UK's Online Safety Act and the proposed Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S. are compelling tech companies to implement more robust age verification and content moderation systems. This has created a new market for firms specializing in AI-based age estimation and digital ID solutions. While these advancements aim to shield minors from harmful material, they also raise significant privacy concerns regarding the collection and security of personal data used for verification purposes.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, where he signed a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons described the preceding contract stalemate with Dallas as the "hardest four months of my life" and expressed excitement for a fresh start with the historic Green Bay franchise. The Packers sent two first-round draft picks and a Pro Bowl defensive tackle to Dallas to secure the deal. The acquisition provides Green Bay with a dominant defensive player they have lacked for years.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most sanctioned nations, North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, becoming the second-largest market by volume in the first seven months of 2025. Imports have more than doubled compared to the same period last year, with the total value reaching over half a million US dollars. This trade is possible because alcohol is not included in the list of luxury goods banned from entering North Korea under United Nations sanctions. China has not imposed its own restrictions, allowing the wine trade to continue flourishing between the two allied countries.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match to reach the fourth round of the US Open, becoming the oldest man to do so since Jimmy Connors in 1991. The 38-year-old tennis star appeared to struggle with a lower back issue early in the match, requiring a medical timeout, but recovered to deliver his strongest performance of the tournament so far. Despite a strong effort from Norrie, who managed to win the second set in a tie-break, Djokovic's superior serving and relentless play secured his victory. The win ties him with Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued a temporary injunction blocking the Trump administration from expanding its "expedited removal" policy to migrants detained within the U.S. interior. This policy allows for the rapid deportation of certain undocumented individuals without a formal hearing before an immigration judge. In her ruling, Judge Jia Cobb argued that the government's plan raises serious due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment. The decision represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to broaden its authority to quickly deport migrants who are not apprehended near the border.</p>
