          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on a significant dramatic role, portraying real-life mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson reveals that he was nervous about the raw and demanding part, which required him to tap into personal childhood trauma to convey the character's struggles with addiction and depression. He explains that after years of focusing on box office success, he sought a more fulfilling and challenging role to "rip myself open" and explore a new dimension of his acting career, marking a new chapter for him.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl offers a commentary on the meaning of Rosh Hashanah, emphasizing its theme of communal atonement and self-reflection. She explains the concept of Teshuvah, or "return," as a hopeful process of returning to one's better self. Buchdahl extends this idea to a national scale, suggesting that the United States could collectively take responsibility for its shortcomings, such as normalizing violence and ignoring the vulnerable, to return to its core values of compassion and generosity.</p>

It defines concepts such as the digital wallet (e.g., Apple Pay), "buy now, pay later" services, and same-day fulfillment, which speeds up delivery from hours to days. The guide also covers social commerce, where purchases are made directly within social media apps, and dropshipping, a retail model where sellers don't hold inventory. Understanding these terms helps shoppers navigate the evolving digital marketplace more effectively and safely.</p>

          <p>A child development expert outlines nine key behaviors that parents can adopt early on to foster exceptional social skills in their children. Instead of focusing on rote memorization of manners, these practices emphasize creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. Key strategies include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, teaching conflict resolution, and validating a child's emotions. By listening more than lecturing and treating mistakes as learning opportunities, parents can help children develop the emotional intelligence necessary for healthy, resilient relationships.</p>

In contrast, Great Britain and Northern Ireland had a disappointing competition, failing to win a single gold medal for the first time since 2003 and finishing 21st in the table.

          <h2>Credit Expert Highlights Three Common Mistakes to Avoid with Rewards Credit Cards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize the value of rewards credit cards by avoiding three key errors. The first mistake is opting for no-fee cards, which often provide inferior rewards compared to cards with modest annual fees. Another common pitfall is hoarding points, which can be devalued by the issuer at any time, making it wiser to redeem them regularly. Finally, the expert suggests that cardholders should not hesitate to call their credit card company to negotiate the annual fee, as retention departments often offer discounts or bonus points to keep their business.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the historical significance of the 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which declared the "separate but equal" doctrine unconstitutional. It traces the legal battle led by the NAACP and attorney Thurgood Marshall, who systematically challenged racial segregation that had been law since the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision. The landmark unanimous ruling did not immediately end segregation but served as a critical turning point in the Civil Rights Movement, pushing the United States closer to its founding ideals of equality for all citizens.</p>

Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey explains that a full map could reveal undiscovered geological features and ecosystems, but also warns that it could accelerate resource exploitation and deep-sea mining.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully exited its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The firm began selling its stake in 2022 after its initial $230 million investment from 2008 had grown to a value of $9 billion. The investment was originally championed by the late Charlie Munger, who saw immense potential in the company. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader reevaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese and Taiwanese investments. (not investment advice)</p>
