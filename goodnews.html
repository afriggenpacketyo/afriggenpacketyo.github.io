          <p>Facing public discontent over soaring rice prices and an upcoming election, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is pushing to reform Japan's rice policy. Rice prices have doubled, prompting Ishiba to target the decades-old production adjustment system, aiming to counter opposition parties proposing consumption tax cuts. Ishiba seeks to boost rice production and has released reserve rice to lower prices, but faces challenges including potential oversupply and market turmoil. Critics urge him not to use rice policy as a political tool. </p>
