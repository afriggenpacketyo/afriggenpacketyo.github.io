          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 12:34:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals appears less threatening to drugmakers following a new deal with Pfizer. The agreement grants Pfizer a three-year exemption from such tariffs in exchange for voluntary price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and research. This development has reassured the industry, suggesting a repeatable model for other major pharmaceutical companies to avoid levies by negotiating similar pacts. The deal led to a significant rally in pharmaceutical stocks, as it provides a clearer path forward and shifts the administration's focus from punitive tariffs to negotiated pricing agreements.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue serving on the central bank's board until at least 2026, pending a full hearing in January. The court denied the Trump administration's request to remove her immediately over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This decision is a departure from previous cases involving the president's removal power over officials at independent agencies. The case stems from President Trump's attempt to fire Cook "for cause," a presidential power that has never before been used against a Fed board member in the institution's 112-year history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximately 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush purchases to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that expired in September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase, helping GM maintain its position as the top U.S. automaker by market share. Industry analysts expect overall EV sales for the quarter to set a new record, though some automakers anticipate a temporary slowdown in October now that the incentive program has ended.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a major initiative to reformulate its private-label food products, committing to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients like artificial sweeteners and certain preservatives by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 products across its store brands, including Great Value and Marketside. The retailer stated the move is a response to consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients and aligns with its goal of increased transparency. This decision follows similar actions by other major food manufacturers and comes amid growing federal scrutiny over the potential health effects of artificial food additives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 12:02:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a $600,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $3,648 per month. This represents a significant savings of about $360 per month compared to January 2025, when rates were over 7%. Over the life of the loan, the lower rate could save a homeowner nearly $130,000 in total interest payments, making homeownership more manageable amid rising inflation and offering a valuable opportunity for both new buyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance.

The move is part of a broader strategy by tech companies to monetize the growing interest in generative AI tools. The new bundle will provide higher usage limits and will soon include access to advanced AI agents previously available only to corporate customers.</p>

          <p>Private flood insurer Neptune Insurance Holdings began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with its IPO timing coinciding with the U.S. government shutdown. The shutdown has suspended the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), preventing it from accepting new applications or processing claims, which could delay real estate closings. Neptune's CEO highlighted that his company remains open for business, offering an alternative for homeowners who require flood insurance for their mortgages. The company, which uses AI to assess risk, is part of a growing trend of properties seeking coverage from private carriers rather than the government. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's pre-tax profit soared to £139 million, up from £67 million the previous year, driven by a 66% increase in revenue to £333 million. The brand's success is attributed to its immense popularity on social media platforms and a growing trend of adults purchasing the toys for themselves. The company's founder stated that the team has been working at an accelerated pace to meet the high demand for its products in 80 countries worldwide.</p>

          <p>Afghans are celebrating the restoration of internet and telecommunication services after a 48-hour nationwide blackout ordered by the Taliban government. The shutdown had provoked widespread international condemnation, disrupting businesses, flights, and access to emergency services. For many Afghan women and girls, who have been barred from education and most jobs, the internet serves as a crucial lifeline to the outside world. While the Taliban has not provided an official reason for the blackout, a provincial official had previously suggested it was to prevent 'vices,' aligning with the regime's strict interpretation of Islamic law.</p>
