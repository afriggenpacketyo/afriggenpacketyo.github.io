He also highlights concerns about President Trump's potential distrust of the National Security Council, possibly stemming from his first impeachment, and the influence of figures like Laura Loomer. McMaster also touches on the administration's stance on European politics, particularly regarding far-right parties and their views on immigration and Western civilization.</p>
