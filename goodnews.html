          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased, marking an all-time high for April. The company expects a significant drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. Other Japanese automakers experienced mixed results, with Honda benefiting from U.S. demand but facing sales declines in China and Japan, while Nissan's global sales fell due to restructuring efforts. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has halted most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign nations, ruling that the levies exceed his legal authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the 10% tariffs imposed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, stating that Congress must authorize such tariffs. The Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling, while global markets rallied on the news. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy.

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District has scrapped its controversial "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community. The proposal, which would have based grades primarily on final exams and de-emphasized homework, attendance, and traditional grading scales, faced criticism from the mayor, lawmakers, and parents. Critics argued that the changes would lower standards and fail to adequately prepare students for success. The superintendent stated that no changes to grading practices have been implemented and that the district remains committed to high standards and student success.</p>

Reform UK has gained momentum in recent local elections, challenging Britain's main parties. Reform defends its policies by proposing to fund them through measures like scrapping net-zero climate initiatives and cutting public sector diversity programs.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a major blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The lawsuit was filed by small businesses that import goods, and the court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, but global markets have responded positively.</p>

Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, said Trump might continue using tariffs but with more restraint, considering their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security. Optimism score is based on the potential for de-escalation and the consideration of more nuanced approaches.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. However, the negotiator also stated that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic and should not be mixed. Japan is seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum. The negotiator emphasized that Japan cannot compromise on its request to have all tariff measures reviewed.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a court ruling allowing it to continue distributing Sony Pictures Television's "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" while a lawsuit appeal proceeds. The ruling pauses a previous order that would have prevented CBS from distributing the shows. Sony filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit, alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and made unauthorized commission payments to itself. The two game shows are among the most-watched programs in television.</p>
