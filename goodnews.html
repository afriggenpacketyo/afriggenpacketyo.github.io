          <p>The parents of U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, who was held captive by Hamas for 584 days, shared their joy after his release, crediting the Trump administration with brokering the deal. After numerous false starts, they received a call from the White House announcing his release, leading to an emotional reunion in Israel. Edan, though weak, is receiving medical attention and is happy to be home with his family. His parents continue to advocate for the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, emphasizing the urgency of their situation and the need for the war to end.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer, it's important to understand the disease, its symptoms, screening methods, and treatment options. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, with early detection often occurring through regular exams rather than symptom occurrence. Screening involves PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, and treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer. While metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, it is treatable, with survival rates having increased significantly over the last three decades.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU agreement aims to "reset" relations post-Brexit, covering defense, fishing, food trade, and youth mobility. UK food exporters could benefit from fewer checks, though the UK must follow future EU food standards. The EU gains 12 more years of access to UK waters, disappointing UK fishermen. Young people may see increased mobility between the UK and EU, but concerns about net migration remain. British tourists may use eGates at EU airports, but implementation timing is unclear. The agreement's fine print will be crucial for its impact on businesses.</p>

          <p>Greggs is trialing a measure to move self-serve food and drinks behind the counter in a few stores to combat shoplifting, including locations in Whitechapel, Peckham, and Ilford. The company is responding to rising shoplifting offenses, which increased by 20% in 2024, although the number of thefts recorded by retailers was much higher. Greggs stated that the safety of colleagues and customers remains its top priority. The change is not expected to be implemented across all of Greggs' 2,600 bakeries, but may be rolled out to sites with high levels of theft.</p>

The amount the UK will pay for access to certain benefits, particularly reduced checks on food exports, is still unclear.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's efforts to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace, finding that the moves led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency were made by leaders who were illegally installed and lacked the legal authority to dismantle the organization. The judge criticized Trump and DOGE, writing they "used brute force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP's headquarters, despite being cautioned that this organization did not fall within the executive branch and its leadership was not subject to the president's unilateral executive branch removal power."</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga, and Cocoteros legally belong to Equatorial Guinea, settling a decades-long dispute with Gabon. The court dismissed Gabon's claim based on a 1974 treaty, ordering Gabon to acknowledge a 1900 treaty dividing colonial assets that handed the islands to Spain. As a result of the ruling, Gabonese troops will have to leave their base on Mbanie.</p>
