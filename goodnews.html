          <h2>Live Aid's 40th Anniversary Prompts Reflection on Its Legacy and Flaws</h2>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 benefit concert is being remembered for both its global impact and its significant shortcomings. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia and set a precedent for large-scale charity concerts. However, critics point to its lack of diversity, featuring no African performers on the main stages and reinforcing a 'white savior' narrative. Despite these criticisms, Geldof defends the event's positive impact, including influencing the cancellation of billions in debt for poor countries, and remains a proponent of collective action for social change.</p>

          <h2>Campaigners Urge for English Ingredient Labeling on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocates in the UK are calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English, arguing that the current system using Latin-based scientific names poses a significant risk to people with allergies. A Labour MP with a severe nut allergy is leading the campaign, highlighting the difficulty consumers face in identifying potential allergens like 'Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis' for sweet almond oil. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, it is not a legal requirement. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based nomenclature as a globally harmonized system, but families affected by allergic reactions argue for clearer, food-style labeling standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembélé has undergone a remarkable transformation, becoming a pivotal player under coach Luis Enrique by embracing a more central, high-pressing role. Previously known for his inconsistency and injuries, the 28-year-old has been lauded as the season's best player, contributing significantly with goals and assists while leading the team's aggressive defensive efforts. This evolution is credited to Luis Enrique's coaching philosophy, which has fostered a disciplined yet supportive environment. Dembélé's newfound commitment and performance have been crucial in PSG's successful season, silencing past criticisms and highlighting his development into a complete and influential forward.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that China's massive dam projects on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that were previously feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flow downstream significantly increased during the dry season. Specifically, low flows in February were up by more than 50%, suggesting the dams regulate water release, augmenting supply when it is naturally scarce. This scientific evidence provides a new perspective on the potential cross-border hydrological impact of China's mega-dam, which has been a source of geopolitical tension with downstream nations like India.</p>
