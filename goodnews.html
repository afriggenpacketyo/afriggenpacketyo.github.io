          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting the latter sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, while allowing the US and UK to continue operating a military base on one of the islands for 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. The deal had faced previous delays due to changes in government and concerns over Mauritius' relationship with China. The UK has faced increasing international pressure to hand over control of the archipelago, which it separated from Mauritius in 1965. The agreement aims to safeguard the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia, deemed vital to national security.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, driven by factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, a potential peak in U.S. bond yields, and expectations of China's economic recovery. Bank of America hailed emerging markets as "the next bull market," while JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities, citing attractive valuations and easing U.S.-China trade tensions.

          <p>US researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to clear their infection and prevent them from spreading the disease. Instead of focusing on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, the team at Harvard University found two drugs that can effectively rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail, offering a new method to combat insecticide resistance. Current efforts primarily aim to kill mosquitoes, but researchers suggest this approach is no longer sufficient.</p>
