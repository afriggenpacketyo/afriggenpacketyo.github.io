          <p>India is experiencing a significant rise in the world of chess, marked by major victories like the Chess Olympiad and the FIDE Women's World Cup. This success is largely attributed to a robust grassroots system, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu, where a culture of dedicated training and strong parental support has created a "factory of Indian chess." The article notes that chess is increasingly seen as a viable career path, with government jobs and professional leagues providing financial stability. This shift from a niche hobby to a professional sport is fueling the nation's growing dominance on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Pfizer raised its full-year profit guidance for 2025, citing the success of its cost-cutting initiatives and a strong second quarter that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was bolstered by better-than-expected sales of its Covid-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs like its bladder cancer treatment Padcev. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share for the year. The updated outlook also accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's tariff policies and calls for lower drug prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA is reportedly accelerating its plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by the year 2030, a key step toward establishing a permanent human base on the lunar surface. The move is seen as part of a new space race, with acting NASA head Sean Duffy highlighting similar ambitions from China and Russia. While many scientists agree that nuclear power is the most viable option for a continuous energy source on the Moon, concerns remain about the ambitious timeline, recent NASA budget cuts, and the geopolitical motivations driving the project. The plan calls for a reactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts of power.</p>

          <p>A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the Trump administration's termination of a $3 billion climate and environmental justice grant program. The lawsuit, the first of its kind to be filed as a class action, argues the cancellation was unconstitutional and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The program, created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was designed to fund community-led projects to address environmental hazards in disadvantaged areas. The plaintiffs are seeking immediate reinstatement of the program and the release of frozen funds for nearly 350 selected groups.</p>

          <p>The new Netflix series "The Hunting Wives" stars Malin Akerman as Margo Banks, a seductive and manipulative housewife in a wealthy East Texas social circle.

Akerman expressed her enthusiasm for the complex character, describing Margo as a "master manipulator" who is vibrant and sexy. The show explores the intricate and often dark relationships within a group of affluent housewives, pushing boundaries for the streaming service.</p>

          <p>China's highest court has showcased twelve legal rulings to demonstrate how the country's landmark private sector law is being enforced, aiming to boost business confidence. The selected cases are intended to guide the judiciary and reassure private entrepreneurs that they will receive equal treatment and legal protection. Most of the highlighted cases involve disputes between private companies and state-backed entities, such as a state hospital failing to pay a private medical device manufacturer. This move is part of a broader effort by Beijing to stabilize the economy and support the growth of private enterprises.</p>

A progressive political organization, Run for Something, reported its largest-ever organic recruitment spike, with over 10,000 potential candidates signing up after Mamdani's win. Aspiring candidates are inspired by his grassroots campaign, which focused on issues like cost of living and housing, and effectively used social media to connect with voters.

          <p>A GPS-guided robot named Turf Tank is revolutionizing the task of lining athletic fields, a job traditionally done by hand. The machine can accurately paint the boundaries for a soccer or football field in a fraction of the time it takes a human crew, making it a vital tool for large sports complexes and events. Developed by an Atlanta-based entrepreneur, the technology has been adopted by over 5,000 clients, including professional sports teams like the LA Galaxy, NFL teams, and numerous colleges. This innovation saves significant labor and time, allowing groundskeepers to focus on turf management rather than the tedious task of painting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released over $5 billion in federal funding for K-12 schools after a four-week freeze sparked significant backlash from educators and lawmakers from both parties. The administration had withheld the funds, which support programs for teacher training, English learners, and after-school activities, citing a need to review their use for a "radical left-wing agenda." The freeze prompted an alliance between rural and urban school districts, who warned of layoffs and budget crises. The reversal signals the political difficulty of dismantling the Department of Education, a stated goal of the president.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The state-owned oil giant posted an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still beat analyst forecasts despite marking the tenth consecutive quarter of declining profits. CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for the future, anticipating that oil demand will increase significantly in the second half of 2025. The company plans to increase capital expenditure and is on track to boost its gas production by over 60% by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's beleaguered property market may be approaching a turning point, with analysts pointing to a potential bottoming out of the multi-year slump. Credit has started flowing to developers again, and the inventory of unsold homes has decreased, leading Fitch Ratings to revise its forecast for new home sales from a 15% decline to a more moderate 7% drop. The consolidation of the market, with state-owned developers increasing their market share, has also been a key factor in stabilizing the sector. These developments offer a glimmer of hope for one of the main pillars of the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>
