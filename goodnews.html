          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>

          <p>Vanguard's global head of rates, Roger Hallam, advises long-term investors to increase their exposure to fixed income, anticipating a slowdown in economic growth, a cooling labor market, and rising inflation that may prompt Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later in the year. Meanwhile, BlackRock's U.S. head of equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs, recommends a "barbell approach" to hedge against economic slowdown risks, expecting a return of cash to equity markets. He highlights buffer ETFs, designed for downside protection, and strong macro themes like artificial intelligence and infrastructure as key investment areas. Both firms are adjusting their strategies to navigate a potentially weaker stock market in the second half of the year, offering varied insights for market participants. (not investment advice)</p>

The article provides a comprehensive list of organizations accepting donations to aid recovery efforts in affected communities like Hunt, Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, and Comfort. These include local funds, churches, emergency response nonprofits like TEXSAR and Texans on Mission, and larger entities such as the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Walmart, and Airbnb.org.

          <p>BNY Mellon, the nation's oldest bank, will serve as the primary custodian for Ripple's new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. This partnership aims to enhance regulatory compliance for Ripple and boost institutional credibility for both the company and the rapidly expanding stablecoin industry. The move signifies a growing interest from traditional financial institutions in stablecoins, dubbed "stablecoin summer," driven by the Trump administration's relaxation of crypto policies and progress in stablecoin legislation. Ripple's recent applications for a U.S. national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account further underscore its efforts to integrate with the traditional financial system.

          <p>New images of China's mysterious wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft, dubbed the "Bohai Monster," have emerged, prompting speculation about a revival of Soviet-era ekranoplan technology. The craft, featuring a boat-shaped fuselage, V-shape tail, and four engines, operates on the "ground effect" principle, which reduces drag and improves fuel efficiency and payload capacity at low altitudes. This design is reminiscent of the Soviet "Caspian Sea Monster" from the 1960s, once the world's largest aircraft. The article suggests that by leveraging this technology, China could develop highly efficient cargo transport vehicles for both civilian and military applications.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyer Demand Rises as Mortgage Rates Reach Three-Month Low</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent dip in mortgage interest rates has spurred a notable increase in homebuyer demand, with total mortgage application volume jumping 9.4% last week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.77%, its lowest level in three months. Both applications for refinancing and new home purchases saw a 9% rise, indicating a positive response from consumers. This surge is attributed to increasing housing inventory and moderating home-price growth. While rates have slightly rebounded, they remain at relatively lower levels compared to recent months, suggesting a potential shift in market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jofra Archer is set to make his long-awaited return to Test cricket for England against India at Lord's, marking his first appearance in over four years. The 30-year-old pace bowler, who has been plagued by back and elbow injuries since 2021, is the only change to the England squad for the crucial third Test. Despite his limited first-class match play recently, England has maintained faith in his talent through central contracts. Archer's comeback at Lord's holds symbolic significance, as it was the venue for his memorable performances in the 2019 World Cup final and his Test debut against Australia.</p>

          <p>Singaporean state investment company Temasek Holdings reported a record net portfolio value of S$434 billion ($324 billion) for its financial year ended March, an 11% year-on-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by strong performance from its listed Singapore-based companies and direct investments in China, the U.S., and India. The firm also undertook its largest divestment amount in over two decades, totaling S$42 billion, as part of an active portfolio rebalancing strategy to enhance resilience in a changing macroeconomic environment. Temasek remains constructive on investment opportunities, particularly in the U.S. for AI capabilities, despite geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's congestion pricing scheme, implemented six months ago, has shown remarkable success, significantly reducing Manhattan traffic delays by a quarter and improving air quality with a 2.5% drop in carbon pollution. Traffic speeds have increased by 15%, and noise complaints have decreased dramatically. Despite these tangible benefits and growing public support, the Trump administration continues its legal efforts to dismantle the program, with President Trump having prematurely declared its demise. The scheme also generates crucial revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, enabling vital upgrades to public transit infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A rodeo bull, known as "Sauce Boss" or "Twinkle Toes," became the latest animal escape artist in the U.S. after breaking free from handlers in Snowmass Village, Colorado, and remaining at large for four days. The bull evaded authorities and cowboys by hiding in dense brush, only to be finally caught when he became more visible. This lighthearted incident follows other recent high-profile animal escapes, including a terrier and nearly four dozen monkeys. The article highlights the public's fascination with such daring dashes for freedom, often involving elaborate recapture efforts and generating social media stardom for the animal fugitives.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a significant decline in homicides, with a more than 20% drop in the first half of the year, putting the city on pace for its lowest total since at least 1968. This mirrors a national trend of decreasing killings across major U.S. cities, a phenomenon experts attribute to complex factors beyond any single cause. Despite this positive development, President Trump and other officials have continued to paint a "dystopian image" of the city to justify federal interventions. The article notes that while police presence and targeted strategies play a role, sustained investment in communities is also crucial for long-term crime reduction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman, an independent, is credited with restoring "normalcy" to the office after his predecessor's contentious term, largely by repealing sweeping reformist policies. While he aims to "get politics out" of the office and focuses on public safety, Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement in L.A. is testing his neutrality. Hochman has avoided direct partisan disputes but his strained diplomacy on immigration raids has drawn criticism from advocates. The article notes that despite his campaign rhetoric, Hochman's felony charging rates remain similar to his predecessor's, and he faces challenges with resource allocation for alternative justice programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Nature Cities argues that beyond physical factors, societal elements like religion, politics, and war profoundly influence the evolution of urban wildlife. In Los Angeles, this means racial segregation and policing strategies can limit animal access to green spaces, while freeway construction contributes to genetic isolation in mountain lion populations. The article highlights how cultural values, such as aesthetic preferences for non-native birds, also shape urban ecosystems. Experts advocate for integrating ecological and social considerations into urban planning, emphasizing that understanding human-animal interactions and historical injustices is crucial for fostering coexistence and biodiversity in cities.</p>
