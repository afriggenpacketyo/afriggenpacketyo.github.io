          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refrained from endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a lack of personal acquaintance. While praising Mamdani's successful campaign focus on the cost of living, Jeffries emphasized the need for a substantive conversation about his vision for the city. Jeffries also stated that Mamdani would need to clarify his positions on Israel and antisemitism to gain broader support, particularly within the Jewish communities he represents. This cautious stance highlights the ideological divisions within the Democratic party following the progressive candidate's primary victory.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas and propelled figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to prominence. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party. The article also features commentary from Newt Gingrich, who sees echoes of Buckley's intellectual critique of elites in Donald Trump's political style.</p>

          <p>The upcoming film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, presents a new take on the iconic hero, portrayed by actor David Corenswet. Gunn explains his vision for a more vulnerable protagonist who is not indestructible and feels more grounded, while Corenswet discusses the challenge of embodying a character so famously played by Christopher Reeve. The film explores Superman's loneliness as an alien who desperately wants to connect with humanity. This interpretation aims to make the character more relatable and rebellious in a modern context by having him stand for goodness in a world filled with meanness.</p>

Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to U.S. tariffs, which are set to be reduced. The government emphasized its commitment to supporting the UK's automotive sector, and Lotus reiterated that the UK remains the heart of its brand.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to partner with supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits and combat obesity. Rather than imposing mandatory rules, the strategy will involve voluntary collaboration where retailers decide how to promote healthier options, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layouts. Major food retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed the policy as a collaborative effort to make healthy eating more accessible, in contrast to what critics from the opposition called a "nanny state" approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. The other two key indicators are whether a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require these elements for strong communication, emotional intimacy, and trust, and their absence can lead to resentment and distance over time.</p>

He described securing a majority in the upper house for his ruling coalition as a "must-attain" but difficult goal. The statement comes as a recent poll shows half of voters do not want the ruling camp to retain its majority. The election is seen as a public verdict on Ishiba's government amid voter concerns over inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty, giving him an opportunity to reshape his governing coalition.</p>

Having grown up amid the erosion of reproductive freedoms and online discourse, many young people are actively resisting traditional definitions of sex, gender, and relationships. They are pushing for a more inclusive and politically conscious approach to sexuality, challenging purity culture and patriarchal norms even as they navigate a landscape of increasing sexual conservatism.</p>

Jain explains that in a startup environment, employees do not have the luxury of being siloed into either thinking or doing; everyone must be capable of identifying a problem and getting into the details to solve it.
