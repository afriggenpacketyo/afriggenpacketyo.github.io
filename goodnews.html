        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that Clayton Kershaw has surpassed Sandy Koufax as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The author contends that while Koufax had a legendary peak, Kershaw's sustained excellence and longevity over 18 seasons give him the definitive edge. The piece highlights Kershaw's superior career statistics in several key areas, such as total strikeouts and wins, while contextualizing his less favorable postseason record. It concludes that Kershaw's enduring presence and professionalism have defined a golden era for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export restrictions on chip-design software to China, a move announced by major semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies are now working to restore access for their customers in China, following a ban implemented in May that required licenses for such exports. This reversal, which also affects other providers like Siemens EDA, caused a significant rise in the stock prices of the involved firms. The development comes amid reports of a broader trade truce and renewed exchanges of technology between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone by recording his 3,000th career strikeout, becoming just the 20th pitcher in MLB history to do so. The moment occurred in the sixth inning against the Chicago White Sox, after which Kershaw received a standing ovation and was congratulated by his teammates. He is only the fourth left-handed pitcher to reach this elite mark and the second in the last century to accomplish it with a single team. The achievement underscores a long and consistently dominant career spanning 18 seasons.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, as stated by its foreign minister during a visit to Beijing. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The move follows Armenia's disappointment with Russia's inaction during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war with Azerbaijan. The nation is now seeking new alliances and has signaled its readiness to enhance cooperation with China without limitations.</p>

          <p>With a slim Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote in the House of Representatives has become more relevant, as seen in a recent vote. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is lost. This procedure means that legislation or resolutions can be defeated without a majority voting against them, highlighting the challenges of governing with a narrow margin.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that broadly restricts migrants who cross the southern border from being able to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had suspended asylum access based on the declaration of an "invasion." The judge stayed the decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. This article explores the potential reasons for this rightward shift within a demographic often misunderstood by political parties. Experts suggest the trend reflects a move towards economic populism rather than social conservatism, driven by disillusionment with the Democratic Party's messaging and policies on the economy and immigration. The results are seen as a wake-up call for Democrats who have historically relied on strong support from the Latino community.</p>
