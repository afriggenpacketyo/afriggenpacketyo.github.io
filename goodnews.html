          <p>With his father, LeBron James, offering advice from a courtside seat, Bronny James delivered a notable performance for the Lakers in an NBA Summer League game against the New Orleans Pelicans. The rookie guard scored 14 points on efficient shooting, adding three assists and two steals in the Lakers' 94-81 victory. Throughout the game, LeBron was seen actively coaching his son, encouraging him to be more aggressive and make decisive plays. Bronny responded positively to the guidance, showcasing his defensive skills and ability to make key plays, including a crucial three-pointer in the fourth quarter, reinforcing his potential as a developing talent.</p>

          <p>A summary of UK Sunday newspapers highlights several key stories, including a forthcoming government report expected to conclude that antisemitism has become normalized in middle-class British society. Other major topics include ongoing negotiations for a migrant return deal with Iraq and criticism of the existing agreement with France, with some arguing it is ineffective. The papers also report on government plans for digital ID cards for immigrants and a financial boost for the electric vehicle industry. The Princess of Wales's well-received appearance at the Wimbledon women's final also featured prominently on many front pages.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams in Tibet May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to fears that China's dam construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet could cause droughts in India, a new study indicates the opposite may be true. Researchers analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, found that downstream water flows to India have significantly increased during the dry season. The measurements, taken since 2014, show that low flows in February rose by over 50 percent, suggesting that the dams may actually be augmenting water supply during drier periods. This finding provides a new perspective on the potential environmental impact of China's extensive hydroelectric projects in the region.</p>

          <p>As the global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, China is rapidly developing its own commercial aerospace industry, with Hong Kong poised to become a significant hub. The sector is no longer dominated by state missions, with private investment in China's aerospace industry expected to grow substantially. Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace have already achieved major milestones, such as launching the first private rocket into orbit. Hong Kong's financial and international standing could provide crucial support for these burgeoning private enterprises as they compete in the global tech race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is aggressively pursuing a new growth model centered on technological advancement by championing what it calls "future industries." First introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this strategy targets emerging sectors with immense potential, even if their foundational technologies are still in early stages. The government has identified key areas for development, including humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. This push for industrial upgrades and self-reliance in core technologies is a central element of China's strategy to compete in the global technology race and secure its economic future.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-up companies like Britain's Better Dairy are on the verge of bringing lab-grown cheese, made using precision fermentation, to consumer markets within the next few years. This technology uses genetically modified yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese without any animal involvement. While proponents tout environmental and health benefits, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high initial costs and a recent decline in plant-based food sales. Overcoming consumer skepticism about taste, texture, and the "ultra-processed" label will be crucial for these novel food products to succeed.</p>
