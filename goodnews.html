          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed investor concerns about the company's significant capital expenditure plans, which range from $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, during an interview with CNBC. Intrator emphasized that the increased spending is driven by the company's success in meeting high demand from major clients for its AI server infrastructure. He also reassured investors that CoreWeave's financing remains strong, and lenders continue to support the company's growth due to its robust contracts. The company has secured deals with major technology players, including Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI, reflecting strong market confidence in its business model.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, cautioned that consumers may soon see higher prices due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is beyond what retailers and suppliers can absorb, leading to concerns about the impact on consumers. The retailer beat quarterly earnings expectations but fell slightly short on sales estimates, and it maintained its full-year forecast. Walmart also reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in both the U.S. and globally.</p>

The author suggests that this event marks a milestone for China's defense industry, showcasing the reliability and lethal power of its state-of-the-art weapons. This aerial engagement, though between Pakistan and India, is viewed as a duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems, underscoring China's progress in modernizing its military capabilities since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods plans to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and tap into Foot Locker's urban consumer base and sneaker culture. Dick's, the largest sports retail chain in the U.S., seeks to extend its footprint beyond the country, while Foot Locker, a mall-based chain, has been struggling with declining sales and store closures. The acquisition faces challenges such as new tariffs on imports and competition from big brands selling directly to consumers. Despite investor concerns about Foot Locker's performance, Dick's intends to keep Foot Locker as a separate chain under its own name.</p>

The agreement ensures that the U.A.E. implements stringent measures to prevent technology diversion and ensure controlled access to the AI technology.

          <p>Disneyland's new "World of Color Happiness!" show, part of the park's 70th-anniversary celebration, has sparked mixed reactions with its focus on all things "happiness." While the show begins with a nostalgic tribute to Disney classics, it quickly shifts to an energetic, music-driven production led by Joy from "Inside Out." Some critics find the show's relentless emphasis on happiness to be somewhat oppressive and disconnected from the broader range of emotions explored in Disney's films. However, the pre-show featuring the Muppets, which brings comedic chaos and charm, has been widely praised.</p>

Despite the positive results, Cava maintained its same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the year, citing slower growth expectations in the latter half of fiscal 2025.
