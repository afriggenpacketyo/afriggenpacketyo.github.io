          <h2>CATL Stock Surges in Hong Kong Debut Amid US-China Financial Decoupling</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CATL, the world‚Äôs largest electric car battery maker, experienced a 16% surge during their Hong Kong stock market debut, though U.S. onshore investors were barred from participating due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. The New York Times article highlights how CATL has become a focal point in the ongoing financial decoupling between the two nations, facing sanctions and scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers, despite its strategic importance and global expansion plans. CATL's Hong Kong listing, raising $4.6 billion, marks a significant shift from past instances like Alibaba's NYSE debut, signaling a growing trend of Chinese companies being excluded from U.S. markets due to national security concerns. This move is expected to impact other Chinese hardware and software producers, limiting U.S. investors' access to potentially profitable opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut. According to the CNBC article, the IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, CATL's core strategy remains focused on markets such as Europe and emerging regions.</p>

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for running across Australia in 35 days, as reported by the BBC. He ran 3,800km (2,361 miles) from Cottesloe Beach in Perth to Bondi Beach, averaging about 100km daily. Goodge began running marathons after his mother died from cancer and used this journey to raise money for cancer charities. The record is yet to be verified by Guinness World Records, and Goodge faced challenges such as dust storms, injuries, and hallucinations during the run.</p>

          <p>China is leveraging President Donald Trump's negative agenda in Latin America by offering financial support, investments, and visa exemptions to several countries in the region, according to this Los Angeles Times article. President Xi Jinping's announcement of a $9.1 billion credit line and infrastructure investments during the CELAC summit positions China as a more reliable partner compared to the U.S. under Trump. While China's economy is growing less rapidly than before, these initiatives allow it to project a positive image in contrast to Trump's focus on tariffs, immigration, and perceived disrespect for agreements.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI to address labor shortages and maintain its global market position, despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement. The DW article explains that Japan's copyright laws are permissive regarding the use of copyrighted material for AI training, attracting AI investors. With a global anime boom and a shortage of skilled animators due to unattractive working conditions, AI is seen as a solution to fill the gap. While artists worry about job losses, some studios emphasize that AI plays a supporting role and cannot replace human creativity.</p>

However, Red Bull remains strong in high-speed corners, making tracks like Suzuka and Imola favorable for them. McLaren excels when rear-tyre degradation is a significant issue or when the corners are slower. The article highlights that these relative performances can change due to upgrades and track conditions, with Red Bull having introduced recent upgrades to improve their performance.</p>
