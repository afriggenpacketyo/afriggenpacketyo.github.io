          <h2>California Enacts Major Housing Reform by Overhauling Environmental Quality Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:37:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to accelerate housing construction. The new legislation largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use, eliminating lengthy environmental reviews and the threat of related lawsuits that often delay development. The move, pushed through as part of the state budget, aims to address California's severe housing shortage by removing what supporters call a major barrier to building. This change marks a significant shift in the state's approach to development.</p>

          <p>According to a financial filing, Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos has sold more than 3.3 million shares of his company, valued at approximately $736.7 million. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that was adopted in March, under which Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains Amazon's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock in recent years to fund other ventures, including his space exploration company Blue Origin and his nonprofit preschool initiative, Day 1 Academies.</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has officially entered the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight rankings at number 14, making him eligible to compete for a world title. The ranking came just two days after his unanimous decision victory over veteran boxer Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. This development makes a potential title fight against current WBA champion Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ram√≠rez a possibility. While a significant milestone for Paul, the WBA's decision is seen by many as reflecting his immense financial drawing power more than his traditional boxing resume.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory challenges.

In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field stated the company would "take big swings," including potential future acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As scientific collaboration between the United States and China decreases, Beijing is significantly increasing its science and technology outreach to countries in the Global South. According to analysts, China has signed numerous bilateral science and technology agreements, marking a strategic shift from its previous focus on the U.S. This development comes as the U.S. State Department is reportedly closing its Office of Science and Technology Cooperation. Experts suggest this trend reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in global scientific research and development partnerships, with China actively building new networks.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a strict new anti-smoking law that bans smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and bus shelters. The measure aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and reduce the 75,000 tobacco-related deaths that occur in the country each year. Violators of the new law could face fines up to 700 euros. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public venues since 2008, this law significantly expands restrictions to outdoor areas, leaving caf√© terraces as one of the last remaining public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek reelection in 2026 has set off a scramble in what is expected to be a highly competitive race in North Carolina. On the Republican side, potential candidates being discussed include the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and RNC Chairman Michael Whatley. For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a run, and his entry would make him a formidable candidate. Tillis's departure from the ticket creates an open-seat battle that will be crucial for both parties as they look to control the Senate.</p>
