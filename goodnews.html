          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at alleviating tensions arising from the existing trade war. The talks carry significant implications for the global economy, which has been destabilized by tariffs imposed by both nations, disrupting supply chains and pressuring businesses to increase prices. While President Trump has expressed openness to lowering tariffs, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick resolution, even with potential tariff reductions, as the overall effective tariff rate would still be significantly higher than before Trump's election. This article highlights the ongoing complexities and potential impacts of the U.S.-China trade dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has ignited widespread anger and unified Iranians across political and ideological divides. The name Persian Gulf has historical roots dating back to ancient Persia, and Iranians view it as integral to their national and cultural identity. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names currently mandates the use of the Persian Gulf for official U.S. business, but Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names as they are used in the United States. This article examines the history and cultural significance of the Persian Gulf and the reactions to Trump's suggestion.</p>

          <p>European officials are emphasizing that food safety standards are non-negotiable as the Trump administration criticizes regulations that restrict the import of American beef and other meats. The European Union prioritizes hormone-free, grass-fed products, reflecting a preference for smaller family operations and traditional farming methods. While trade officials are willing to make concessions to avert a trade war, they are steadfast in maintaining strict health and safety standards, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and acid-washed chicken.

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed a novel algorithm that allows first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in demanding flight missions. This breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, leverages nature's aerial acrobatics, seen in species like sparrowhawks and ravens, to redefine traditional drone flight paradigms. The algorithm enables drones to rapidly adjust speed and direction, performing vertical or inverted flights to navigate obstacles and enhance performance. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasized that this biological wisdom transforms high-risk maneuvers into high-survival rewards, unlocking the full potential of drone flight.</p>

          <p>At a town hall in Pennsylvania, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona urged the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party, emphasizing the need to be more inclusive and less ideologically rigid. Gallego cited the example of Joe Rogan, suggesting that the party's tendency to "kick people out of the tent" has hindered its ability to win elections. He highlighted his own success in Arizona, a battleground state, as an example of how Democrats can win by forming alliances with those they may not agree with on every issue.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly important suppliers, supported by investment and cooperative farming.

The province's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology. This article highlights the strategic importance of Yunnan in China's food security strategy.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee, two major coffee chains in China, are finding renewed success by focusing on expanding into lower-tier cities. While facing challenges like sluggish consumption and intense price competition, Starbucks reported stable same-store sales and increased transaction volume due to its expansion into over 1,000 county-level markets. Similarly, much of the growth in coffee shop openings across China has been concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities."

          <p>Despite efforts to promote a cashless society, Japan's adoption of app-based digital salary payments remains limited, with only a small fraction of workers opting for this method. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment option, only 2.8% of surveyed individuals use it, citing a lack of perceived benefits and increased administrative work for companies. The survey also indicates that about a third of people do not want to receive their salaries on one of the apps.
