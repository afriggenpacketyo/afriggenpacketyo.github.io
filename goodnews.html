          <p>This excerpt from Kathy Wang's new novel, "The Satisfaction Café," introduces the protagonist, Joan Liang, whose life in America begins with a brief, tumultuous marriage that ends after she stabs her husband. The narrative delves into her past in Taiwan, exploring the melancholy of the married women she knew, including her own mother's dramatic unhappiness over her father's infidelity. These formative experiences, contrasted with her parents' pressure for her to succeed financially after moving to California for her master's degree, provide deep context for her journey. Her path ultimately leads her to create a unique safe space, a café where people can find what they truly want: to be heard.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are expressing strong confidence in Uber, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, highlighting their long-term potential beyond short-term market challenges. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney sees Uber's growth in gross bookings and the rollout of robotaxi partnerships as key drivers, maintaining it as a top pick. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet, citing solid fundamentals, AI-fueled growth, and the strength of its non-ad businesses like Cloud. Anmuth is also bullish on Meta, justifying its premium valuation with its vast user network, strong advertising value, and disciplined investment in major tech waves like AI and the Metaverse.

          <h2>Analysis Explores Superman's Leftist Origins Amidst Political Commentary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to conservative pundits criticizing the new Superman film's director for calling the character an "immigrant," this article delves into the superhero's leftist origins. It features an interview with Grant Morrison, author of "All-Star Superman," who explains that the character's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, were the sons of Jewish immigrants. The earliest 1930s comics portrayed Superman not just as a hero, but as a "socialist figure" and "The Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt capitalists and tore down slums to force the construction of low-rent housing. The article traces how his image evolved through the decades, from a patriotic figure in WWII to a family man in the 1950s, reflecting America's changing culture.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Suggest China Can Counter US Tech Curbs by Cooperating with the Global South on AI</h2>

          <p>According to policy analysts, China could effectively respond to U.S. technology restrictions, such as the "small yard, high fence" strategy, by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South. Jiang Yuhao, a researcher at the Institute of Public Policy, suggests that this approach would move beyond the direct rivalry with the United States. He argues that by promoting collaborative technology creation, inclusive AI infrastructure, and shared ethical frameworks that address diverse regional concerns, China can build alternative partnerships. This strategy would focus on the equitable sharing of advanced technologies rather than direct confrontation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers' wide receiver group is adjusting to the unexpected retirement of veteran Mike Williams just before the start of training camp. His departure puts more pressure on an already scrutinized unit, particularly former first-round pick Quentin Johnston, who is expected to step into a larger role after a much-improved second season. The team will also rely heavily on standout Ladd McConkey and rookie Tre’ Harris to fill the void left by Williams, who was known for his veteran presence and elite skill in winning contested catches. Johnston expressed confidence, stating he has what it takes and must now prove it daily.</p>

          <p>Amid growing public dissatisfaction with the Democratic and Republican parties, this article explores the systemic barriers that prevent third parties from succeeding in the United States. Political expert Lee Drutman explains that the "single-winner" electoral system inherently disadvantages third parties, often relegating them to "spoiler" roles and discouraging ambitious politicians from joining them. He argues that a move towards proportional representation, specifically through multi-member districts where parties win seats proportional to their vote share, could create a more viable path for multiple parties. This reform would make elections more competitive and allow for a government that better reflects the country's diverse political views.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Australian Rugby Team's 'Desperation' May Not Be Enough to Overcome Lions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' first Test victory over Australia, much of the post-game analysis has focused on the "desperation" of the Australian Wallabies to win the next match and keep the series alive. However, this article questions whether desperation alone can overcome the Lions' superior performance, noting that such emotion only lasts for a short period in a match. While Australia may be bolstered by the return of key players, the Lions demonstrated a higher level of physical and creative play for most of the game. The author suggests that the Lions' own uncharacteristic errors in the latter part of the match gave Australia hope, a scenario unlikely to be repeated.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has announced a government plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030. Describing the water sector as "broken" and the regulator Ofwat as "clearly failing," Reed promised a "water revolution" that includes tougher treatment for water company executives if standards are not met, potentially including prison sentences. This marks the first time a clear target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following public outcry over the state of the nation's rivers. The plan also includes a ban on wet wipes containing plastic, but Reed ruled out nationalizing the water companies due to cost.</p>

The drills will be held in China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, which borders Vietnam, and will be themed around "joint border patrol training." This development comes as the two countries mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties and occurs against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has previously called for cooperation to counter what he termed "unilateral bullying."</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in northern Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The bear's fate became the subject of intense legal battles and protests after an initial order for its euthanasia was challenged and ultimately reversed by animal rights groups. The bear arrived safely at the Alternative Wolf and Bear Park, where it will live in a secure, specially constructed enclosure. The incident has highlighted the growing issue of human-wildlife conflict in the Trentino region, where an EU-funded bear reintroduction project has led to a surging population.</p>

          <p>A rare fossil of a Sinopterus pterosaur discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this type of flying reptile, challenging previous assumptions about its diet. Researchers found phytoliths, which are microscopic plant minerals, and small quartz crystals inside the creature's stomach. The presence of these materials, particularly the quartz which likely acted as gastroliths or "stomach stones" to help grind tough food, strongly suggests that this species was herbivorous. This finding provides new insight into the diverse ecosystems of the dinosaur era and the dietary habits of the creatures that once ruled the skies.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have captured the first direct evidence of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's protoplanetary disk, which are the essential building blocks for planets like Earth. This observation provides an unprecedented look at a process that occurred in our own solar system over 4.5 billion years ago. The discovery suggests that the initial steps of planet formation may be a common process, offering new insights into the potential for Earth-like worlds elsewhere in the universe.</p>

Mead discussed the need to be ready to contribute in any capacity, including playing in unfamiliar positions, for the good of the team.

The goal is to move beyond basic commodities to include higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals, automotive products, and green energy technologies.
