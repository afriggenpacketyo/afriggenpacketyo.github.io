          <p>In the second Test match at Edgbaston, India has taken firm control over England, largely thanks to a monumental innings from captain Shubman Gill. Gill scored an epic 269 runs, the highest score ever by an Indian batter in England, helping his team amass a total of 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled, leaving the team at 77-3 by the end of the day's play. This performance puts India in a commanding position to level the series.</p>

          <p>This article provides a financial comparison for homeowners considering borrowing $150,000 against their home equity. It breaks down the differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). While initial monthly payments may be similar, the key distinction is stability versus flexibility; a loan offers a predictable payment, whereas a HELOC's payments can change with market interest rates over the life of the credit line.
