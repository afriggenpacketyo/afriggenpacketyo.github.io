          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the individual accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. Over the trial, the prosecution presented evidence of Routh's extensive planning, including surveillance, purchasing a military-grade weapon, and conducting internet searches related to the attack. The final witness, an FBI agent, detailed how Routh lived at a gas station for a month while stalking Trump. Routh, who is representing himself, is expected to call three witnesses for his defense on Monday.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St James's Park in London. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his desire to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of the late monarch. The final design for the statue and the memorial, which will also feature a new bridge and gardens, is set to be revealed in 2026. Jennings stated he will consult with the Royal Family and listen to public sentiment to ensure the representation is fitting for a monarch so widely admired for her devotion to duty.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multibillion-pound investments in the UK by American tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is fueling optimism about Britain's potential as an "AI superpower." The deals, highlighted during President Trump's state visit, signal a strong "tech bromance" and a belief in the UK's scientific research capabilities, particularly in the Oxford-Cambridge-London "Golden Triangle." However, the influx of US capital has also drawn criticism, with figures like Sir Nick Clegg suggesting Britain is merely "clinging on to the coattails of Uncle Sam." The long-term consequences could see the UK become a key tech laboratory for US firms in the global AI race against China.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has reflected on his defining role as the "psychopathic gangster" Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," emphasizing that he is nothing like the violent character he portrayed for six seasons. As he promotes his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" movie is coming to Netflix, though the plot remains a closely guarded secret. He described playing Shelby for nearly a quarter of his life as a "gift and a privilege," allowing him to grow with a character in a way that is unique to long-form television. The show's enduring success, he believes, is a kind of "magic" rooted in its excellent writing.</p>

The marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, aimed to unite a movement to hold leaders accountable amid concerns over recent actions by the Trump administration. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children. Organizers emphasized that the walk was also intended to build a sense of community, which they see as essential for sustaining long-term, nonviolent political action.</p>

          <p>Looking ahead to the next week on Wall Street, investors are advised to monitor key earnings reports from companies like Micron and Costco, as well as new home sales data. The week will also see the release of the latest personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a crucial inflation metric for the Federal Reserve. Market analyst Jim Cramer suggested that while some investors are skeptical of recent market gains, many sectors could continue to rally. Developments from President Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping concerning a potential TikTok deal are also expected to influence stock movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fate of TikTok in the United States may depend on a potential licensing agreement for its powerful and closely guarded recommendation algorithm. As the U.S. and China negotiate a deal to avoid a ban, one proposed solution involves a new U.S.-based entity licensing the algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. However, experts caution that a licensing deal, rather than an outright sale, might not fully sever ties and could still allow ByteDance to access metrics or influence content ranking.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the lengthy filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for being filled with political rhetoric and self-praise rather than focused legal arguments. While tossing the suit, the judge is allowing Trump's legal team to refile a shorter, more conventional complaint within 28 days. When questioned about the dismissal, Trump deflected, stating "I'm winning the cases," before criticizing the reporting of ABC News, demonstrating his continued adversarial stance toward the media.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call on Friday and made "significant progress" toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., according to a White House official. However, a final agreement has not yet been reached. In a social media post, Trump described the call as "very productive" and stated he appreciated the "TikTok approval." This development comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly delayed a federally mandated ban that would require TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has announced a new policy proposal to open police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this "police desk promise" would make law enforcement more accessible, making it easier for the public to report crimes and share information, thereby boosting confidence in policing. To fund the initiative, the Liberal Democrats suggest scrapping the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) positions, which they claim would free up the necessary cash. The announcement comes at the start of the party's annual conference as it seeks to define its platform.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA superstar Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his bitcoin account on the cryptocurrency exchange after being locked out for years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, highlighting the difficulties they faced with the platform's account recovery process. Durant, an early investor in both Coinbase and bitcoin, purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was a small fraction of today's price. The high-profile case has amplified a wider discussion among users about the quality and effectiveness of Coinbase's customer support services.</p>
