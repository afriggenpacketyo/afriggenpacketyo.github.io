          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, indicating that wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainties. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, although sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. While Richemont faces headwinds like rising gold prices and foreign exchange fluctuations, analysts believe the company's pricing power could offset these challenges. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would continue to require strong agility and discipline.</p>

The Gulf states are showcasing their wealth and willingness to invest in deepening ties with the U.S., with deals including a $1.2 trillion economic exchange with Qatar and Saudi Arabia promising $600 billion in U.S. investments.

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to strengthen its domestic market to reduce vulnerability to external tariff shocks, even with a temporary truce in the trade war with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized bolstering "domestic circulation" to enhance economic self-reliance and offset global uncertainties. This strategy involves creating a robust, unified domestic market to ensure China's development remains steady.

          <p>A comprehensive genetic analysis by an international team has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, revealing that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. The study, led by researchers at the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. This work could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows since 1996. This trend was driven by institutional investors seeking haven assets amid concerns about the U.S. economy and trade tensions. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the appeal of Japanese assets.</p>
