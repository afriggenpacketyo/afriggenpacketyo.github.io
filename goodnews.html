The lightsaber, believed to be the only screen-used hero prop of its kind ever publicly auctioned, is valued at up to $3 million. The three-day event, hosted by Propstore, features over 1,000 lots of silver screen history, from Batman's suit to the "Men in Black" neuralyzer.

          <p>The NBA is considering another major change to its All-Star Game format in an effort to increase player effort and fan excitement. For the 2026 game in Los Angeles, the league is proposing a round-robin tournament featuring three eight-player teams: two composed of U.S.-born players and one of international players. This move comes after years of declining competitiveness, culminating in a widely criticized 211-186 score in the 2024 game. The proposed format aims to solve the numerical imbalance between American and international stars while creating a more engaging and competitive event.</p>

          <p>CEOs of major sportsbooks like DraftKings and BetMGM are forecasting unprecedented levels of betting activity as the NFL season kicks off, signaling robust consumer engagement despite broader economic concerns. The American Gaming Association projects that legal betting on the NFL will grow by 8.5% to reach $30 billion this season. Executives report that pre-season betting volumes are already up significantly and that there is no sign of a slowdown in customer spending or activity.

          <p>Scientists studying two tiny grains from the asteroid Ryugu have discovered a rare phosphide mineral that does not naturally occur on Earth. The samples, delivered by Japan's Hayabusa2 mission, are pristine relics from the early solar system, offering insights into the chemical reactions that formed our planets. Using non-damaging X-ray analysis, researchers identified a diversity of elements and compounds within the grains. The discovery of this unique mineral, similar to biologically-linked struvite found on Earth, continues to fuel theories about the role of extraterrestrial matter in the origin of life.</p>
