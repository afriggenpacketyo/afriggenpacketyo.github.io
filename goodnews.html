        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the 'Hillsborough Law,' a landmark bill compelling public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a legal "duty of candour," with criminal sanctions for breaches, and aims to prevent cover-ups like those seen after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which killed 97 football fans. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the decades-long fight by victims' families, stating the law will serve thousands by changing the balance of power and ensuring the state cannot hide from the people it serves.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered what are believed to be the world's oldest mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, in Southeast Asia. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that hunter-gatherer communities in the region practiced smoke-drying their dead over fires. This process, identified through heat exposure marks on ancient bones, predates the previously known oldest mummies from the Chinchorro people of South America by thousands of years. The practice likely allowed relatives to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, a tradition still seen in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to reveal its most advanced smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect event, marking a strategic shift from virtual reality headsets to a more mass-market device. The new glasses will feature a small display and neural-based wristband controls, building on its partnership with EssilorLuxottica. This move comes as Meta's Reality Labs division continues to post massive financial losses, totaling nearly $70 billion since late 2020. Investors are watching closely to see if the AI-integrated glasses can generate consumer buzz and provide a potential return on the company's substantial metaverse investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, historian Fara Dabhoiwala discusses the history of free speech, arguing it has never been a simple or coherent ideal. Using the recent killing of Charlie Kirk as a backdrop, the article explores how free speech is not merely the absence of censorship but is shaped by power, context, and the ability to be heard. Dabhoiwala explains that speech is a form of action with real-world consequences, a fact that absolutist interpretations often ignore. The discussion traces the concept from 18th-century England to the modern digital age, highlighting the challenges posed by online platforms that amplify certain voices for profit.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the legendary "Thrilla in Manila," this article revisits the epic third boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, a brutal contest that tested the limits of human endurance. Held on October 1, 1975, the fight was the culmination of a bitter rivalry that had soured from friendship into deep animosity, reflecting broader societal tensions. Staged in the Philippines under the autocratic Marcos regime, the event was a global spectacle that showcased both the beauty and the ugliness of boxing. The narrative explores the fighters' intertwined histories and the fight's lasting legacy as a mirror to society and the human spirit.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan High Court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national suspected of murdering 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru in 2012. Wanjiru's body was discovered in a hotel's septic tank in Nanyuki, near a British army base, nearly three months after she was last seen with British soldiers. The ruling, which protects the suspect's identity, allows for extradition proceedings to begin from the UK. The family's lawyer welcomed the decision as a step toward justice, while the UK government stated its commitment to helping the family secure a resolution in the long-unsolved case.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a blow to the administration. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in this week's policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had attempted to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denied, but the case has raised significant questions about the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference. The law permits a president to remove a governor only "for cause," a term legally untested until this case. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of UK pensioners receiving winter fuel payments plummeted from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year, according to new government figures. This sharp decline was the result of a controversial Treasury decision to means-test the payment, restricting it to low-income individuals on specific benefits. Following widespread public and political backlash, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a U-turn in June. The policy has now been revised, making pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less eligible, which will restore the payment for over three-quarters of pensioners this winter.

          <p>Researchers have scientifically confirmed the source of a vibrant blue color in Jackson Pollock's iconic 1948 painting, "Number 1A, 1948." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, scientists created a chemical fingerprint that identified the pigment as manganese blue, a synthetic color phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment in his work. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides new insight into the materials used by the abstract expressionist and aids in art conservation and authentication.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the government's "triple lock" policy, the pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. This increase would raise the new state pension by over £500 a year, but it also brings pensioners closer to paying income tax, as the personal tax allowance remains frozen. Experts predict that individuals relying solely on the new state pension will become taxpayers by April 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

The club explained that while it ended third-party agreements four years ago, this particular arrangement from a decade ago persisted without a formal contract.

          <p>Today's date, 9/16/25, is being celebrated by mathematicians as a rare and special occasion that occurs only once a century. The date is unique because each number is a perfect square (3², 4², and 5²). Furthermore, the base numbers (3, 4, and 5) form a Pythagorean triple, meaning they satisfy the famous theorem a² + b² = c² (9 + 16 = 25). Mathematicians describe the date as revealing a "hidden mathematical poetry" and a beautiful coincidence that connects a simple calendar date to one of the most fundamental theorems in mathematics.</p>

At these institutions, students typically recoup their investment in under two months, thanks to low net costs and programs aligned with workforce needs.
