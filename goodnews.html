        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, this market analysis argues that several positive factors are buoying the stock market. Strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone, and proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's latest bill are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. The article also points to massive investment in data centers, energy infrastructure, and a potential lending boom from relaxed bank stress tests as key drivers of economic strength. These elements combined suggest a robust environment for stocks, countering fears of a market downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is relaunching the Pensions Commission to address warnings that future pensioners will be worse off than today's retirees without intervention. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) highlighted that nearly half of working-age adults, especially the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. This savings gap is projected to leave those retiring in 2050 with £800 less per year. The revived commission will bring together experts, unions, and employers to build a national consensus on how to encourage greater private pension savings, particularly among underrepresented groups.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ predicts that quantum computing technology will cross a significant threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. The CEO, Xiang Jingen, compared the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that substantial development is still required for broad application. SpinQ has already sold its quantum computing products and software to customers in over 50 countries, positioning itself as a key player in the emerging field.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush with a dominant four-stroke victory. The 29-year-old world number one finished the tournament at 17-under-par, marking his second major championship win of 2025 and his 11th PGA tour victory since 2024. This win puts him in an elite group with Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. Scheffler now needs only a U.S. Open victory to complete the coveted career Grand Slam in professional golf.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to over 100 injuries and the arrest of 95 miners on riot charges. The criminal case against the miners later collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to answer questions that have remained for 40 years, fulfilling a Labour manifesto promise to uncover the truth about the event and its aftermath.</p>

          <p>Khan Academy is piloting an AI-powered tutor called Khanmigo in over 260 U.S. school districts to provide personalized academic support for students and assist teachers with lesson planning. The platform is designed to guide students toward answers by asking them questions, rather than simply providing solutions. A unique feature, added at the request of educators, allows the AI to detect when a student expresses thoughts of self-harm or emotional distress in their writing or chats. It then flags this content for teachers and administrators, creating a safety net that has already been used to intervene and provide mental health support.</p>

          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, the artisanal Mexican spirit mezcal is experiencing a global surge in popularity, transforming it into a half-billion-dollar-a-year industry. The vast majority of mezcal is produced in Oaxaca by family-owned distilleries using traditional, labor-intensive methods passed down through generations. This boom has revitalized communities like Santiago Matatlán, allowing families who once struggled to make a living to grow their businesses and create local jobs. The spirit's rise from a locally consumed beverage to a premium product in international markets highlights a growing appreciation for handcrafted, authentic liquors.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's performance is drawing widespread comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods in his prime. In the last four seasons, Scheffler has won four major championships and secured 13 PGA Tour victories, establishing himself as the undisputed world number one. His peers and commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like." While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his calm demeanor, combined with a recently improved putting game, has transformed him into the most formidable force in men's golf today.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Advocates for Teaching 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Life Skill for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their own feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach is said to build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are crucial for lifelong mental health.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit founded by tech billionaire Adam Miller, called Better Angels, is aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. The organization is bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to finance them with private equity and conventional loans, which it claims will reduce costs and construction time significantly compared to traditional tax-credit models. By creating a profitable model, Miller hopes to attract more private, for-profit developers to the affordable housing sector to address the homelessness crisis. The initiative is already backing two smaller projects nearing completion.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaky pipes, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This new consumer champion, which will have legal powers to resolve disputes, is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry following public outrage over rising bills and pollution. The move aims to bring the water sector in line with other utilities that have a single watchdog for consumer issues. The announcement comes as the Environment Secretary described the sector as "broken" and pledged to set clear targets for reducing sewage spills.</p>
