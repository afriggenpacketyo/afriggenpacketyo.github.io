          <h2>Strategies for Managing High-Interest Credit Card Debt Before July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 13:50:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs and average debt loads around $8,000, consumers are advised to take immediate action to manage their debt. Experts recommend checking current interest rates and exploring options to reduce them, such as balance transfer cards. Calculating a repayment timeline is crucial to determine if current payments are sufficient or if more extensive debt relief options are needed. Various debt relief solutions exist, including credit counseling, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans, tailored to individual circumstances. Taking these steps before July can help consumers regain financial independence. (not investment advice)</p>

Circle's Chief Policy Officer believes the GENIUS Act will provide regulatory clarity and stimulate investment in the stablecoin sector.

          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen disagrees with the team's vote to ban the 'tush push' play, arguing that if a team can't stop it, they should keep running it. Allen believes that the play's effectiveness varies depending on a team's practice and personnel. The Green Bay Packers initiated the proposal to ban the play, citing safety concerns, but the NFL has not reported any injuries from it. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie brought Jason Kelce to a meeting to argue against the ban, ultimately swaying owners to forgo its approval. Allen's stance highlights a division in opinion regarding the controversial play. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate GOP's tax package proposes a tax break on auto loan interest, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 annually, but it appears to exclude used cars. Qualifying vehicles must be U.S.-assembled cars, minivans, SUVs, pickup trucks, or motorcycles for personal use, with loans secured after December 31, 2024. Tax experts note the Senate bill limits the deduction to new cars, potentially reducing its benefit for low- and middle-income taxpayers who often purchase used vehicles. The House version included all-terrain vehicles, trailers, and campers, which the Senate legislation excludes. This tax break, part of a broader bill, aims to cut taxes by slashing spending on health programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bogong moths in Australia undertake an annual 600-mile migration, using the Earth's magnetic field and the starry sky to navigate. Researchers discovered that these moths rely on visual cues from the stars, specifically the Milky Way, to orient and navigate. This is the first time an invertebrate has been found using stars for navigation, with neurons in the moth's brain specifically responding to the starry sky. The moths migrate to cooler caves in the Australian Alps to enter a dormant phase, returning to their breeding grounds in the fall. The findings could aid in the conservation of these endangered insects by reducing light pollution. </p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing $50,000 can explore home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or home equity loans, both offering potentially lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans. While current rates are similar (around 8.2%), HELOC rates are variable and can change, while home equity loan rates are fixed. HELOCs offer interest-only payments during the draw period, providing flexibility, while home equity loans require immediate full payments. Borrowers should consider their financial circumstances and speak with a lending expert to determine the most suitable option. Understanding the rate structures and repayment terms is crucial for long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Labour peer's proposal to use cats for pest control in the Houses of Parliament has been rejected. Senior Deputy Speaker Lord Gardiner cited risks from construction activity, self-closing doors, and lack of care arrangements. Larry the cat remains the chief mouser at 10 Downing Street.
