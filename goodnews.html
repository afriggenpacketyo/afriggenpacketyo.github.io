          <p>The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, lauded the Trump administration's new TrumpRx platform, calling it a "major step" towards making prescription drugs affordable for Americans. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts, up to 85% on some medications, through the direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform, in line with the lower prices paid by Europeans. While experts like Stacie Dusetzina express skepticism about the program's broad impact on most Americans' out-of-pocket costs, suggesting it may only benefit a smaller group who pay cash, Makary believes it will effectively address the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, expecting more drugmakers to join the initiative when the website launches next year.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce publicly criticized Philadelphia Eagles receiver A.J. Brown for expressing his frustrations online about his role, despite the team's undefeated 4-0 start. Brown had posted a cryptic message after a low-yardage game, indicating his displeasure, prompting a discussion among sports commentators about team dynamics versus individual grievances. While Kelce acknowledged players' right to frustration, he emphasized the importance of prioritizing team success over personal statistics, particularly when the team is winning. Brown later took accountability for his emotions, clarifying his post was not directed at anyone within the Eagles organization, and team management downplayed any concerns about his commitment, suggesting the issue is now resolved.</p>

          <p>As autumn brings a rise in respiratory illnesses, Dr. Oscar Duke provides expert guidance on differentiating symptoms of colds, flu, and COVID-19, noting their overlapping nature but highlighting key distinctions. Colds typically develop gradually with nasal and throat issues, flu adds aches, fevers, and muscle weakness, while COVID-19 might include loss of smell/taste or a "razor-sharp" sore throat. The article explains how colder weather, increased indoor gatherings, and school environments contribute to virus spread, advising self-isolation for recovery and seeking medical advice if symptoms persist or worsen. Dr. Duke offers practical tips for self-care, including paracetamol, vitamin D supplementation, and hydration, while cautioning against overuse of decongestant sprays.</p>

This significant surge is driven by benchmark coffee futures hitting a 50-year high, which has boosted raw bean prices and local growers' profits, creating a windfall for the region. The increased overseas demand is also spurring industrial reforms, with factories upgrading equipment and technology to meet evolving consumer needs and quality standards. In 2024, Yunnan's coffee exports soared by 358% year-on-year, showcasing its growing prominence and strategic position in the global coffee market.</p>

          <p>The PGA of America president, Don Rea Jr., issued a belated apology for "disrespectful, inappropriate" fan behavior at the Ryder Cup, where European players faced vitriolic abuse. This apology comes after Rea initially downplayed the incidents in a BBC interview, comparing them to a "youth soccer game" and suggesting such behavior was common. European players, including Rory McIlroy, whose wife was reportedly hit by a beer, and Matt Fitzpatrick, expressed outrage at the abuse and Rea's initial comments, deeming them offensive. CEO Derek Sprague also apologized personally to the McIlroys, acknowledging the behavior "crossed the line" and the need for accountability.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth increased by 8% in extended trading after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in "close communication" with the White House regarding potential partnerships. This follows recent Trump administration investments in other rare earth miners, including a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and a 15% stake in MP Materials, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China. Humpton supports these investments, stating it will take many players to build out the rare earth supply chain and emphasizing her company's transparency with the administration. USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, aligning with national security and manufacturing goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese investors hold $21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), significantly benefiting from gold's nearly 50% rise this year, marking a world-beating rally. Swiss banks Julius Baer and Lombard Odier predict gold prices could reach $4,000 and $3,900 an ounce respectively in the next 12 months, with JPMorgan Private Bank even more bullish. Gold is increasingly seen as an effective portfolio diversifier and hedge against political and economic risks, supported by a weaker dollar, robust central bank demand, and investor concerns about government debt. This trend contrasts sharply with the declining US dollar index, highlighting gold's role as a stable asset amidst broader global uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission released an updated "planetary health diet" report, advocating for a diet rich in nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy, and sugar. This diet aims to cut global greenhouse gas emissions from food systems by over half and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually, according to new research from over 35 countries. The report, widely accepted by global health and environmental experts, faces a "coordinated campaign" of misinformation, particularly from the meat and dairy industries, that has successfully riled up public opinion in the past. Researchers highlight the weakening of fact-checking on social media and the rise of AI tools as factors fueling disinformation, underscoring the challenge in promoting sustainable eating.</p>

          <p>California has introduced a new design for its driver’s licenses and identification cards, featuring enhanced security measures including a first-in-the-nation digital signature on one of the barcodes. The new cards replace previous designs with updated imagery showcasing California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, while retaining the REAL ID symbol, a golden bear with a star. The magnetic strip on the back of the old licenses has been removed in this redesign, which is part of periodic updates to improve security and prevent counterfeiting, following the last major update in 2010. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so motorists are not required to immediately update their cards.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance and President Trump, falsely claimed Democrats were demanding billions for "free healthcare for illegal aliens." A BBC Verify fact-check debunks this, clarifying that Democrats are pushing to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, not to expand coverage to undocumented immigrants. Federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded healthcare for undocumented individuals, and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries explicitly denied any intent to change this long-standing policy. The Republican claim misrepresents Democratic efforts to restore healthcare access for "lawfully present" immigrants, such as refugees, who would lose benefits under recent policy changes, thereby fueling political misinformation.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs in the U.S. to match prices in other developed countries and participate in the TrumpRx platform, marking a significant win for President Trump's long-standing efforts to reduce prescription drug prices. This deal, reportedly influenced by threats of 100% tariffs on drug companies not manufacturing in the U.S., signifies a collapse of the pharmaceutical industry's previously united front against such policies. While the immediate practical impact on most patients' out-of-pocket costs remains ambiguous, as many would still pay cash, the agreement sets a precedent. Trump expects similar deals from other major drugmakers, suggesting tariffs are a powerful tool to motivate industry concessions.</p>

          <p>College rankings, now a cultural staple influencing perceptions of higher education, began as a highly controversial experiment, as explored in this article. Edwin Embree's informal 1934 list of "greatest universities" sparked widespread outrage and threats, revealing the deep anxieties institutions held about their status. Early attempts at ranking, like Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were quickly suppressed due to intense controversy and political intervention. The modern U.S. News & World Report rankings, emerging in the 1980s, capitalized on consumer demand and institutional competition as higher education became a mass-consumer good, leading to evolving methodologies and some institutions gaming the system.</p>

Many hail from provinces known for strong business cultures and blend past experiences of scarcity with current market opportunities and technological advancements.
