          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 19:54:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever." The agreement reportedly includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports to the U.S. and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. Key provisions of the deal involve Japan opening its markets to American cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products. The announcement follows a period of tense negotiations and comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in a recent election, potentially weakening Japan's negotiating stance.

          <p>Capital One's stock price increased in after-hours trading despite reporting complex quarterly results heavily influenced by its recent acquisition of Discover. While GAAP figures showed a net loss due to accounting treatments for the merger, adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the transformative potential of owning a payments network, a rarity in the banking industry. Although integration costs are expected to be higher than initially projected, investors appear to be focusing on the long-term strategic benefits and synergy opportunities from the deal.

          <p>Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, is traveling to Europe to continue diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with a recent Israeli proposal for IDF withdrawal zones being a key point of discussion. The U.S. administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. The diplomatic push continues as Israel expands its military operations into new areas of Gaza, increasing pressure on the civilian population.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Primary Home Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering eliminating the federal capital gains tax on profits from the sale of a primary residence. The proposal aligns with a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aimed at easing what she calls an "unfair burden" in a market with high home values. Currently, individuals can exclude up to $250,000 of such gains from their taxable income, with a $500,000 exclusion for joint filers. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax locks older homeowners in place, while critics contend that eliminating it would primarily benefit the wealthy.

          <p>Researchers with the shark-tracking group OCEARCH have detected a massive great white shark, nicknamed "Contender," swimming approximately 50 miles off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Weighing an estimated 1,653 pounds and measuring nearly 14 feet long, Contender is believed to be the largest white shark ever tagged in the western North Atlantic. The adult male was first tagged off the coast of Georgia in January and has since been tracked along the U.S. East Coast. The data collected from his tag over the next five years will provide valuable insights into the species' migration patterns.</p>

Massive funding rounds for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have driven this investment boom. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion generated through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This trend suggests that while investors are pouring vast sums into developing AI applications, the opportunities for realizing returns through sales or public offerings remain comparatively limited.
