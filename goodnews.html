          <p>A new documentary, "Shenzhou 13," offers an unprecedented 8K ultra-high-definition view of life aboard China's Tiangong space station, filmed entirely by the astronaut crew. The production follows astronauts Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu during their six-month mission and has captivated audiences, including acclaimed science fiction author Liu Cixin. Liu, known for "The Three-Body Problem," expressed excitement at the premiere, stating that such achievements bring science fiction visions to life. He anticipates that China's planned 2030 lunar landing will showcase even more awe-inspiring feats.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, becoming the second most studied foreign language after English. This growing demand is driven by young Turks seeking better higher education and career prospects in Germany due to Turkey's challenging economic situation and stressful working conditions. Elite Turkish high schools now see a significant percentage of graduates pursuing studies in Germany, and universities report fully booked German courses. For many, learning German is seen as a crucial step toward accessing academic freedom and a more stable job market abroad.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck early Saturday off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was located about 70 miles east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of approximately 24 miles. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the seismic event. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat advisory but later canceled it, while Japan's meteorological agency noted the possibility of only slight changes in sea levels with minimal risk of damage.</p>

          <p>Colleges like Roanoke College in Virginia are adding or reviving football programs in hopes of increasing overall enrollment, particularly among men, whose college attendance rates have been declining. Administrators believe the sport, along with marching bands and cheerleading, fosters a sense of belonging and school spirit that attracts more students. However, research indicates that while adding football can cause an initial one-year spike in male enrollment, these gains typically fade within a few years. Despite the data, schools continue to invest in football as a strategy to create a livelier campus and generate tuition revenue in a competitive higher education market.</p>

          <p>As teenagers increasingly use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts urge parents to engage in early and open conversations about the technology. They recommend that parents learn about AI themselves and explore its capabilities alongside their children, teaching them to fact-check AI-generated information and use it as a learning aid rather than a shortcut. While AI can be a helpful tool, there are significant risks, as some chatbots have been found to provide unsafe responses related to mental health crises. Setting clear household rules and prioritizing real-world interactions are key to responsible usage.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez when it deleted her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed the account "without a clear and transparent justification" and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. Meta had argued Gómez violated its rules, but the court stated that social media posts are constitutionally protected. The ruling orders Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided ahead of the highly anticipated bout between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Those favoring Crawford point to his superior technical skill, adaptability, and reach advantage, believing he can outbox the aging Álvarez, similar to how Floyd Mayweather Jr. did. Conversely, supporters of Canelo emphasize his significant size and power advantage, as Crawford is moving up two weight classes for the fight. They argue that while Crawford is a master boxer, Canelo's ability to control distance and deliver powerful blows will ultimately be the deciding factor in the manufactured but intriguing contest.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly, youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed its first female prime minister. Sushila Karki, a former Supreme Court Chief Justice known for her strong anti-graft stance, took the oath of office as the interim leader. The "GenZ" protests, which were initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into a broader movement against the country's economic woes. With Karki's appointment, calm has begun to return to the capital, Kathmandu, and new elections have been scheduled for March 5.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to bolster its scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers in science to help them transition back to their careers after childbirth. The program, initially launching at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is aimed at highly qualified researchers under 40 who have recently given birth. While the initial scope is limited, it is being viewed as a significant step in supporting women in STEM fields.</p>
