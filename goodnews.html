          <p>An Indian man was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle dozens of rare reptiles, including venomous vipers, into the country. Customs officials discovered three spider-tailed horned vipers, five Asian leaf turtles, and 44 Indonesian pit vipers concealed in the man's luggage. While importing animals is not illegal, India's wildlife protection law prohibits importing certain species, especially those classified as endangered or protected. The passenger did not have the required permits and licenses for importing the wildlife, leading to his arrest.</p>
