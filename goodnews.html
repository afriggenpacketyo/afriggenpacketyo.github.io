          <p>San Diego Padres star reliever Mason Miller made MLB postseason history during a crucial Game 2 victory against the Chicago Cubs, helping his team avoid elimination. Miller's ninth pitch of the night, a scorching 104.5 mph fastball, became the fastest recorded in postseason history since pitching track began in 2008, impressively striking out Cubs catcher Carson Kelly. He dominated the Cubs lineup, striking out all five batters he faced over 1.2 innings, showcasing the strength of the Padres' bullpen. This stellar performance, coupled with Manny Machado's two-run homer, secured a 3-0 win and forced a decisive Game 3 in the Wild Card series, underscoring the team's resilience and determination.</p>

          <p>China's three most economically significant cities have implemented new policies to alleviate property sector weakness, aiming to stabilize the industry and boost consumer sentiment. Analysts suggest these efforts, seen as a crucial defense for the real estate market, might lead to short-term regional rebounds but won't quickly end the broader slump. The property sector's decline significantly impacts over a dozen related industries and consumer confidence, contributing to the economy's current challenges. Despite maintaining around 5% growth, China faces persistent household deleveraging and trade tensions, making property stabilization vital for sustained economic health.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged significantly after announcing a partnership with OpenAI as part of its 'Stargate' initiative. This collaboration focuses on increasing the supply of advanced memory chips, essential for next-generation AI, and expanding data center capacity in Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean leaders and company executives to solidify plans for scaling up HBM chip production, critical for powering AI models like Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. The announcement further solidifies SK Hynix's leading position in the AI value chain, while Samsung works to certify its HBM4 chips with Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, with his fortune briefly reaching $500.1 billion. This unprecedented wealth accumulation is attributed to the rising valuations of Tesla, his artificial intelligence startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. The milestone firmly establishes Musk as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of other tech billionaires. His wealth is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have seen a sharp increase this year as investors welcome Musk's renewed focus on his companies rather than political engagements.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that while third-quarter market winners might continue to see modest gains, the most significant upward movements for the year may have already occurred. He advised investors to examine Q3's top performers as a guide, noting that fund managers often buy these stocks in Q4 to showcase strong portfolios. Companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, and Warner Bros. Discovery saw massive surges, driven by AI demand, balance sheet improvements, and takeover speculation. Cramer highlighted Intel's turnaround under its new CEO as another notable performer, attributing its near 50% gain to strategic capital moves and government funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC article debunks common myths about cooking oils, clarifying which ones are best for different culinary uses and their health impacts. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge explains that sunflower and vegetable oils, despite bad press, are beneficial due to their low saturated fat content and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats. The article also rehabilitates margarine, noting modern versions contain minimal trans fats and can help reduce bad cholesterol. Crucially, it clarifies that basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, while vegetable or sunflower oil is superior for deep frying due to higher smoke points, contrary to popular belief.</p>
