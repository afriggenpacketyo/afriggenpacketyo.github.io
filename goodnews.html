          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones following a car crash in New Hampshire. His vehicle was struck from behind at high speed on Interstate 93, resulting in fractured vertebrae, lacerations, and injuries to his arm and leg. Giuliani's spokesperson confirmed the crash was not a targeted attack. Prior to the incident, Giuliani had stopped to assist a domestic violence victim. All three individuals involved, including the 19-year-old driver who hit Giuliani's car, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

          <p>Despite current US-China tensions, American mercenaries known as the 'Flying Tigers' from World War II remain revered in China for their pivotal role in defending the nation against Imperial Japan. These American pilots, who operated under a lucrative contract, destroyed nearly 500 Japanese planes while suffering minimal losses. The enduring bond is highlighted by the invitation of the founder's relatives to a military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of WWII. This article explores the formation, combat tactics, and lasting legacy of the Flying Tigers, showcasing a unique historical alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has notably transformed the Oval Office decor, applying what he calls 'Trump touches' with extensive gold accents. This 'goldening' includes gold trimming on the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, with even cherubim sculptures painted gold. The changes, reportedly paid for personally by Trump and inspired by Versailles, have sparked mixed reactions, from being hailed as a symbol of a 'golden age' to being criticized as 'vulgar' and 'gaudy'. This article highlights how Trump's aesthetic choices depart significantly from his predecessors, reflecting his real estate background.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is commemorating the 80th anniversary of its declaration of independence from French colonial rule, marked by a military parade in Hanoi. Despite ending a century of French dominance in 1945, French cultural influence, particularly in architecture and gastronomy, remains widespread though often unrecognized by younger generations. Iconic colonial buildings now house government offices, and French-inspired foods like baguettes (banh mi) and pate are staples. While French language fluency is declining, the lasting cultural imprints reflect a complex historical relationship that has evolved into congenial diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion has begun, offering 30 hours of free term-time care for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a 'landmark moment' for working families, nurseries report long waiting lists and staff shortages. The sector needs an estimated 35,000 more staff, and low pay continues to be a barrier. Parents also face confusion over 'free' care, with many nurseries increasing charges for extras due to insufficient government funding rates, raising concerns about regional inequalities and accessibility.</p>
