          <p>According to an analyst from Soochow Securities, the global bull market is fundamentally supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, allowing Chinese stocks to remain resilient. Market concerns persist regarding U.S. fiscal policy, the global economic outlook, and political instability under President Trump. However, the analyst argues that while trade tensions have caused market corrections, they are unlikely to have a significant long-term impact as investors have grown accustomed to the threat of higher duties.

          <p>A ceasefire agreement in Gaza, brokered by the U.S., has entered its first phase, involving the release of all living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The initial stage saw a halt in fighting and an increase in humanitarian aid entering the Strip. Subsequent phases of the plan will address the demilitarization of Gaza, the destruction of military infrastructure, and the establishment of a transitional governing body, though significant points of contention remain for future negotiations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff publicly praised the "tireless efforts" of UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell in securing the Gaza ceasefire, highlighting the UK's vital coordinating role. This commendation contrasts with criticism from the U.S. ambassador in Israel, who downplayed the UK's involvement. The praise provides a political boost for Powell, who has been facing pressure over an unrelated domestic issue, and underscores his close working relationship with American diplomats on international conflicts.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel from his ABC show, following pressure from the FCC over comments about Trump supporters, sparked a significant public backlash that ultimately led to his reinstatement. This article argues that the incident, and the subsequent high ratings for his return, proved that late-night television remains a relevant and influential cultural force. The solidarity shown by fellow hosts like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers demonstrated a united front, suggesting that the genre's future may depend on its hosts collectively defending their right to speak truth to power.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. Their research spans economic history and theoretical models, notably advancing the understanding of "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace older ones. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences praised the laureates for showing that sustained growth is not guaranteed and requires an understanding of the scientific and economic conditions that foster continuous innovation.</p>
