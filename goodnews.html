          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Dalian, China, Premier Li Qiang urged countries to collaborate on trade, despite rising tariffs and barriers, emphasizing that globalization is irreversible. He called on all parties not to turn trade into a political or security issue, asserting that engaging in the international economy is a means of reshaping global rules and order. Li Qiang avoided specific comments on U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, focusing instead on the importance of economic cooperation. The event was attended by political leaders from Singapore, Vietnam, and Ecuador, as well as prominent figures from Chinese tech and business sectors.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani after Mamdani secured a strong lead with 44% of the vote. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign, which resonated with younger voters, and hinted at a possible independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal led by Senator Mike Lee to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, including California, was halted after being deemed extraneous to the budget under the Byrd Rule. The plan aimed to address housing needs by selling up to 3.3 million acres managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Despite the setback, Lee is attempting to revise the proposal by removing Forest Service land and limiting eligible Bureau of Land Management land to areas near population centers. Environmentalists and public land advocates are celebrating the decision, but are preparing for further debate on the matter.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral Democratic primary is a battle between left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, reflecting the party's internal divisions. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has gained momentum with a focus on affordability and progressive policies, while Cuomo seeks a comeback after resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's platform includes free public buses, universal childcare, and rent freezes, but critics question the feasibility of these promises. The race utilizes ranked ballots, making it difficult to predict the outcome, but it is being closely watched as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is increasing, but needs further acceleration to meet net-zero targets. The CCC emphasizes the importance of lowering household bills to incentivize the transition to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump installations remain below target despite government grants. The CCC also advocates for making electricity cheaper by removing charges related to older renewable energy projects from household bills, which could save households approximately ¬£200 annually, but at a significant cost to the Exchequer.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, offering insights into how new stars are born. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study the Milky Way's evolution.</p>
