          <p>Utility workers excavating in Lima, Peru, have discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old mummy. The remains, believed to be of a woman from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, were found just 20 inches underground and remarkably still had intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists note that such discoveries are common in Lima, which is home to hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate that naturally mummifies remains. This finding offers another glimpse into the ancient civilizations that inhabited the area long before the Spanish colonization.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit modest, return to boxing by stopping Tyrrell Herndon in the seventh round. This was Wilder's first win since 2022, following a series of high-profile losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight was a stripped-back affair, lacking the spectacle of his previous bouts, as the 39-year-old works to rebuild his confidence and skills. While the victory was dominant, Wilder's performance indicated he is still on a path to regaining his former fearsome form.</p>

This generation, which grew up with smartphones, has significant spending power, much of it directed towards online services and social media purchases. To counter the abstract nature of digital transactions, experts suggest using tangible methods like giving physical cash as pocket money. Another proposed technique is "pizza budgeting," a visual exercise to help children understand household expenses and the value of money.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A chief economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. The reasoning is that the country's mature third-party payment platforms, like WeChat and Alipay, already function similarly to stablecoins and are supported by a well-established regulatory framework. According to the research note, this existing infrastructure, which pegs digital money to fiat currency with strong safeguards, positions China favorably. The analysis suggests policymakers should leverage this existing strength as digital currencies become more prominent globally. (not investment advice)</p>

In the trial, a stent electrode was inserted into the brain's vasculature of a paralyzed patient, who was then able to regain some limb movement.
