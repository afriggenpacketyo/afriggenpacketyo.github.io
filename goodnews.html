          <h2>Fitbit Data and Google Geolocation Help Exonerate Man and Convict Real Killer in Wisconsin Murder Case</h2>

          <p>In a Wisconsin murder case, advanced technology played a crucial role in both clearing an initial suspect and convicting the actual perpetrator for the 2016 killing of Nicole Vander Heyden. Her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was first arrested but later exonerated when his Fitbit data showed minimal activity during the time of the murder, corroborating his alibi. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify another man, George Burch, whose location data from his phone's Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene, where the body was found, and near where her belongings were discarded. Burch was subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after a six-month tenure. Fulcher stated the departure was his own decision and amicable, aligning with his original plan to serve for half a year. During his time, he advised on personnel and policy, contributed to major acquisition program reviews, and supported efforts to redirect funds toward military readiness. His departure is part of a broader personnel shuffle within Hegseth's office, though defense officials have characterized the recent exits as standard transitions.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the US Eagles with a six-try performance in a match characterized by high humidity and two lengthy delays due to lightning in Washington D.C. Despite the challenging conditions, the mostly young English squad demonstrated precision, with captain George Ford guiding the team effectively. The match ended with a final score of 38-5 after a late consolation try from the Eagles. The event also set a US record for attendance at a women's rugby game, which was played prior, as World Rugby aims to build audiences ahead of future World Cups in the US.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass killings, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. This move comes in response to attacks like the one in Southport, where the perpetrator was fixated on violence but not motivated by a defined political or religious cause. The proposed law would mirror existing counter-terrorism legislation, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, such as researching a target. The goal is to close a legal gap and ensure that planning for mass violence is treated with the same seriousness as terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday to address issues like learning loss and the high cost of childcare for working parents. Proponents argue that a shorter break, with holidays spread more evenly throughout the year, could help mitigate the widening learning gap between children from different economic backgrounds. However, the proposal is divisive, with many teachers opposing the idea, valuing the long break for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers the impact on holiday pricing and the challenges of increasingly hot summers due to climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for savers to move their money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares, suggesting the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The government plans new ad campaigns and targeted messages to encourage this shift, and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize investment ISAs. This has sparked debate, with experts noting a gender gap in investing and warning that a forced approach could backfire. Critics argue for better financial education before pushing inexperienced individuals toward higher-risk options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, private members-only clubs is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creative professionals. Unlike the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas reserved for old money and establishment figures, these new clubs, like Soho House, offer a more relaxed and contemporary environment. They provide spaces for networking, collaboration, and leisure, with membership based on personal accomplishment rather than family legacy. This trend reflects India's economic transformation and the demand from a new elite for exclusive spaces that align with their modern values and professional needs.</p>
