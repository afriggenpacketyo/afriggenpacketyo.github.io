          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 19:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order that doubled steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50% for other countries. While the new order increases import taxes for US firms buying from other nations, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, has yet to take effect, meaning UK steel exporters will continue to face tariffs until then. A UK government spokesperson reiterated the commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, though Conservatives have expressed concern over the ongoing tariffs. The UK's exemption provides temporary relief as the two countries work towards implementing the full tariff agreement.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, 2025, after a nine-year absence, a move announced by McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger. The Snack Wrap, consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce, and cheese, was removed in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities. The company has created a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, featuring fan content and a Change.org petition with nearly 19,000 signatures advocating for its return. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a simplified recipe to ensure faster service, though pricing will vary by location.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed an interim measure in the Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This proposal aims to create a temporary arrangement while a broader agreement is developed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The interim step seeks to provide a foundation for future negotiations and reduce immediate tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program. This approach signifies a potential shift in strategy towards a more gradual and phased approach to resolving the nuclear issue.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that President Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, create market instability and encourage short selling. He suggests that investors are overly cautious due to Trump's unpredictable statements on trade and specific companies. Cramer believes Wall Street underestimates the need for AI infrastructure, citing Nvidia's fluctuating stock performance as an example of market skepticism. He claims Trump has revived short selling, with hedge funds betting against stocks like Nvidia, but that these short sellers can suffer losses when businesses perform well.

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the company behind Oreo, has filed a lawsuit in the US against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks. The lawsuit claims that Aldi's similar packaging is likely to deceive consumers and benefit from Oreo's reputation. Mondelƒìz also accuses Aldi of copying packaging for other products like Wheat Thins, Nutter Butter, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. Aldi UK stated that it is not involved in the lawsuit, as it operates as a separate business from Aldi US.</p>
