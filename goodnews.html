          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. According to Trump, this partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with the bulk of the investment occurring within the next 14 months. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel was previously blocked by former President Joe Biden over national security concerns. Trump has also said he'll hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH is caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain, leading to difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems, and is estimated to affect hundreds of thousands of older Americans. The singer is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during his recovery, as early diagnosis and treatment with surgery can often reverse symptoms. Experts emphasize that the condition is likely underdiagnosed because its symptoms can easily be dismissed as normal effects of aging.</p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally after President Trump signed executive orders aimed at overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and accelerating the deployment of new reactors in the U.S. The orders force the NRC to make decisions on nuclear license applications within 18 months and create a regulatory framework for building reactors on federal land, with the goal of jump-starting uranium mining and expanding domestic enrichment capacity. Advanced reactor companies Oklo and NuScale saw significant gains, while Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp. also rose. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez and Oklo head Jacob DeWitte were present at the signing ceremony.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge said the executive order is violative of the Constitution and found that the order infringes on the First, Fifth and Sixth amendments. The order against Jenner & Block instructed officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearances, identify any goods, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal jobs.</p>
