          <p>Travel bookings from China to South Korea have significantly increased in recent months. This surge is attributed to the receding political instability in Seoul and the improved bilateral relations between the two nations, shortly before visa exemptions take effect.

          <p>The US is reviewing its role in the Aukus security pact with Australia and the UK, raising questions about the future of the agreement.  While the review's purpose is to align with the president's "America First" agenda, analysts suggest the US is unlikely to completely abandon the pact due to its strategic importance in the Indo-Pacific region.

          <p>President Trump approved the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel, but only under a national security agreement that includes significant new investments and a golden share for the U.S. government.  The deal, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker, has been highly politicized due to national security concerns and the role of U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania.

          <p>A study reveals that radiologists, due to their training in medical image interpretation, are less susceptible to certain optical illusions than non-experts.  This finding challenges previous theories about the universality of perceptual experiences and suggests the brain's ability to adapt and improve visual accuracy through training.  The article explores the implications of this research for medical imaging and our understanding of perception.</p>
