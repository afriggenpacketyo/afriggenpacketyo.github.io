          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post interpreted by Trump administration officials as an assassination threat against President Trump. Comey posted a photo of seashells forming the numbers "86 47," a phrase used by Trump's critics to mean dismiss or remove Trump. The homeland security secretary and director of national intelligence publicly commented on the post, with the former saying the Secret Service was investigating it. Comey deleted the post and said he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence, while Trump claimed Comey knew exactly what it meant and was calling for his assassination.</p>

          <p>Theresa Fortune, a Bay Area mother, has turned her personal struggle with postpartum depression into art, creating a piece that is now permanently displayed at Kaiser in Oakland. Ten years ago, Fortune contemplated suicide while facing poverty and pregnancy, but she found solace in storytelling through a documentary and a collage depicting a Black mother mid-birth. Her art caught the attention of a Kaiser Permanente executive, leading to a partnership and a message of hope for those experiencing mental health issues.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release audio recordings of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified information. Republicans have demanded the release of the audio, arguing it might reveal a decline in Biden's mental acuity, which was mentioned in Hur's report. The decision comes as Democrats grapple with new revelations about Biden's health while in office. The Biden administration had previously asserted executive privilege and argued that releasing the audio could hinder future investigations, but the Trump administration disagreed.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Council members proceeded with a vote to increase the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from city lawyers that the vote could violate the state's open meeting law. The city attorney's office advised delaying the vote due to insufficient notice under the Ralph M. Brown Act, but the council voted in favor of the wage increase. A do-over vote was later conducted at a special meeting, yielding the same result. Critics questioned the timing of the vote and suggested it was politically motivated to benefit a hotel workers union.</p>

          <p>A man in Belfast spotted a 4ft starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River at Victoria Park, a rare occurrence in an urban environment. The shark, a species known to inhabit areas like the River Thames and the River Mersey estuary, was observed for about 30 minutes. Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins suggested the shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river. This incident is not entirely unusual, as smooth-hounds have been recorded in cities in recent years.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took senior Treasury Department officials by surprise. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, causing officials to scramble to understand the implications. The decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief. Some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979. Turkey and Saudi Arabia support normalizing relations with Syria's new government, which is facing challenges paying civil service salaries and rebuilding the war-ravaged country.</p>

          <p>Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers have agreed to a five-year, $265m contract extension. The deal includes $181m in guaranteed money, solidifying Purdy‚Äôs role as the franchise quarterback moving forward. Purdy was the final pick of the 2022 NFL draft but quickly defied expectations, leading the 49ers to back-to-back playoff appearances, including a Super Bowl trip.

          <p>An angler fishing in Lake Michigan discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank over a century ago. The Wisconsin Historical Society confirmed the discovery, noting that the J.C. Ames was built in 1881 and scuttled in 1923. The ship had been buried in the sand for decades before recent storms exposed it. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks before invasive quagga mussels destroy them. The discovery is considered exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface.</p>
