        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily ease tariffs imposed over the last couple of months, according to a joint statement shared by the White House. Both sides committed to a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since early April, with the understanding that ongoing discussions have the potential to address each side's economic and trade concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. This news has buoyed commodities and currency markets in Asia and beyond, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (P.K.K.), a Kurdish group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades, announced it would lay down its arms and end the conflict. This decision comes months after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, urged the group to disarm, stating that the armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The P.K.K. began as a secessionist group seeking an independent state for Turkey‚Äôs Kurdish minority but more recently sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey. This move could end one of Turkey's most enduring security problems and deliver a significant political victory to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, potentially influencing other Kurdish militias in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to use executive powers to significantly cut prescription drug prices in America, aiming for reductions between 30% and 80%. He intends to introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest price worldwide. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks, reflecting concerns about potential profit losses for drug companies. Trump's previous attempts to cap drug prices faced legal challenges, and the impact of this new executive order on government health programs remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. This new law expands on a 2010 initiative that created an animal abuse registry, now adding penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine for those who violate the ownership ban. The expanded legislation was signed after dozens of dead cats were found in a Long Island home, highlighting the need for stronger protections for animals. The law aims to close a loophole, ensuring that those who disregard the ban on pet ownership will face consequences.</p>

The US has imposed tariffs on global imports and proposed fees targeting Chinese vessels, aiming to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security. These fees, set to take effect in mid-October, will charge vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau when docking at US ports. Despite these challenges, the shipping industry is expected to remain resilient and adjust to market changes.</p>

          <p>Landmark China-US trade talks are likely to carry economic and political significance, kick-starting a long process towards substantive deals that should address tariffs and other trade barriers. The apparent upbeat move in Geneva stands to give both powers interim political relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war battlefront. The talks resulted in an agreement to establish a ‚Äútrade consultation mechanism‚Äù. Analysts suggest this is part of a strategic process to manage bilateral competition, economic resilience, and long-term development goals.</p>

          <h2>India-Pakistan Top Military Officials to Speak as Ceasefire Holds</h2>

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are due to speak to discuss finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them. President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire, saying "it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much". The US-brokered ceasefire between the nuclear-armed neighbours appears to have held overnight after nearly four days of intense shelling and aerial incursions from both sides. India announced it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns.</p>

          <h2>A Look at US Presidential Gifts and the Rules Governing Them</h2>

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is preparing to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have set off a storm of criticism, as ethics experts say such a gift would violate rules within the constitution that seek to guard against bribery and corruption. There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. Under US law, foreign gifts valued at less than $480 can be retained by federal employees. Anything over that amount is considered a gift to the ‚Äúpeople of the United States‚Äù and must be logged and then disposed of by the White House Gift Unit.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are planning to bring back elk to the East Midlands - and to the UK - for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to begin feasibility studies into their return. The animals are regarded as "keystone" species which can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. One of the major challenges is getting the public used to the idea that elk "should be here".</p>

          <p>Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack, 59 remain in the enclave, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.</p>
