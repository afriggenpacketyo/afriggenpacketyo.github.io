        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have refuted claims that she played a role in a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, dismissing the allegations as a ploy for "tabloid clickbait." The summons to court stemmed from accusations that Swift encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for the film 'It Ends With Us,' which is at the center of a sexual harassment case. Baldoni alleges that Lively, along with her husband Ryan Reynolds and Swift, acted as her "dragons" during script discussions. Swift's representatives maintain that she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions related to the film and never reviewed or provided notes on the project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances, potentially enabling more clinical research on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to align with the increasing cannabis consumption in the U.S. The EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that currently hinder federal funding for research on schedule I substances. While some experts believe the bill has bipartisan potential, others are less optimistic about its near-term prospects due to the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Americans, particularly Democrats, are increasingly seeking refuge in the Cotswolds, England, due to concerns over President Trump's policies. Applications for UK citizenship have surged, and the Cotswolds, with its idyllic villages and luxury amenities, is becoming a popular destination. The influx is driven by fears of Trump's authoritarian clampdown, attacks on academia, and political opponents, leading many to seek a plan B outside the United States. The area is experiencing a boom in luxury brands and lifestyle businesses catering to the new American residents, drawn by the safe environment and access to Europe.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth's orbit. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which successfully landed several probes on Venus. The re-entry highlights the increasing amount of space debris and the challenges of managing objects in orbit, though the risk of damage on Earth remains minimal.</p>
