          <p>Syria is scheduled to hold its first parliamentary elections in mid-September following the collapse of the Assad regime, a moment seen as a potential new beginning for the war-torn nation. The new 210-member parliament will serve for a three-year transitional period, but the process is fraught with challenges. While the new electoral system offers hope, there is significant skepticism among minority groups and others regarding the transparency and legitimacy of the vote, particularly as interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint 70 of the seats himself.</p>

          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected a request from the Trump administration to lift a federal injunction that restricts the methods of immigration enforcement agents in Southern California. The ruling maintains limitations that prohibit agents from targeting individuals based solely on factors like ethnicity, language, or being in certain locations known for hiring immigrant labor. This decision is seen as a victory for immigrant advocates and the City of Los Angeles, which argued that the raids involved unconstitutional racial profiling amid the administration's aggressive enforcement actions.</p>

The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who became the Premier League's most expensive Asian player upon his arrival in 2015, leaves as a club legend with 173 goals in 454 appearances. His departure comes just months after he led Spurs to a Europa League victory, ending their 17-year trophy drought, and he is now reportedly in negotiations with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has cast doubt on English batter Joe Root's ability to perform in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Speaking ahead of his debut in The Hundred tournament, Warner pointed out Root's historical struggles in Australia, where he has never scored a century, and noted his vulnerability to bowler Josh Hazlewood. Warner's comments add a layer of competitive banter to the long-standing rivalry as England prepares to challenge for the urn for the first time in a decade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new comic from NPR's Life Kit delves into the common awkwardness people feel when receiving compliments and what this reaction reveals about self-perception. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao explain the science behind why praise can be difficult to accept. The piece argues that gracefully accepting kind remarks is not only beneficial for one's own self-esteem but also positively affects the person giving the compliment, making a case for embracing these positive social interactions instead of dismissing them.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has commented on the "complex" and "far from ideal" transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak. The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool, reportedly valuing the Swedish international closer to £150 million. Isak was left out of the team's pre-season tour due to a minor injury and has been training alone at his former club, a development Howe learned about through the media. Howe expressed his desire for Isak to remain with Newcastle but acknowledged the uncertainty of the situation.</p>

          <p>Two state-owned Chinese firms, SinoHydro Group and Citic, have signed deals to invest a combined $350 million in large-scale agricultural development in Angola. The investment will develop tens of thousands of hectares for grain, soybean, and corn production, with a significant portion of the output, around 60 percent from one project, to be shipped directly to China. This move is part of China's broader strategy to enhance its food security by investing in agricultural production abroad, while also establishing research centers in Angola to improve crop yields.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. In a podcast interview, Badenoch, who was born in the UK, explained that she considers herself British by identity and has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s. She said her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political views, and she returned to the UK at age 16 because her parents saw no future for her there due to the worsening political and economic climate.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Genetic Link Between the Potato and a Tomato Ancestor</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pioneering study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary history of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event about nine million years ago between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuberous, potato-like plant. This discovery, published in the journal Cell, suggests that this ancient cross-breeding was the key driver for the development of tubers, the trait that makes the potato a global staple food today.</p>

The game saw early goals from LAFC's Dennis Bouanga and Pachuca's Elías Montiel, as well as red cards for both teams. Despite earning two points for the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the quarterfinals are slim, as they needed an outright victory to stay competitive in the standings.

          <p>In response to growing user fatigue and a decline in usage, dating apps are introducing new features to keep the search for love online. Companies are experimenting with concepts like no-chat-before-the-date models, group dates, and premium, high-cost tiers to reignite interest in a market where users are tired of generic profiles and ghosting. This evolution reflects a broader sense that the established "swipe-and-chat" model is becoming stale, pushing platforms to find novel ways to facilitate genuine connections and counter the feeling of online dating as a chore.</p>
