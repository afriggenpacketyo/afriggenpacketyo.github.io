          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a forthcoming "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country" but did not disclose which country he was referring to. Several US media outlets have speculated that the deal is with the UK, citing sources familiar with the plans. Trump's announcement comes after he imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, followed by a 90-day pause on those levies. The US is also reportedly in trade deal discussions with India and Israel, and continuing talks with Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, which would be the first such deal since imposing tariffs last month. Specifics remain unclear, and there is no official confirmation from either the White House or the British embassy. The US has been in talks with the UK for weeks, discussing lowering tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as taxes on US technology companies. The UK is also prioritizing a separate trade agreement with the EU, which is likely to align British standards with European ones.</p>

          <p>A digital avatar of Agatha Christie is teaching an online writing course using A.I. to create her likeness. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses scripts written by academic researchers based on Christie's writings and archival interviews, with a real actor's performance overlaid with an A.I.-generated "digital prosthetic." While Christie's family estate has approved the project, some ethicists raise concerns about the ethics of reanimating deceased artists without their consent, even when using their own words.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to search for water ice at the moon‚Äôs south pole. The study estimates that ice comprises no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil. The findings could inform the selection of landing sites for future lunar missions and the design of China's proposed research base on the moon. The research also adds new evidence that water ice exists on the moon.</p>

The key takeaways were that vibe coding relies more on prompt engineering than traditional coding, and that AI is making it easier for non-technical individuals to create apps. The author also suggests that AI may decrease the need for hiring expensive software engineers for startups.</p>
