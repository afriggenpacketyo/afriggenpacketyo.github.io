          <h2>Latin American Women's Network Transformed Safe Abortion Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how a network of women in Latin America revolutionized access to safe, self-managed abortions. Beginning in the 1990s, activists shared information about misoprostol, a drug initially used for stomach ulcers but found effective for abortions. They established hotlines and accompaniment groups to support women through the process, navigating legal restrictions and societal stigmas. The movement gained momentum, leading to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, though self-managed abortions with accompaniment remain a preferred option for many, even where legal services are available, due to its warmth and commitment. The success of these networks highlights the power of grassroots activism and information sharing in reproductive healthcare. The work of these activists is now being seen as a cultural, social, political, and medical revolution.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in Ames v. Ohio, authored by Justice Jackson, which addresses the question of how much the law should treat a person as an individual versus as a member of a group. The case involved a heterosexual woman who sued after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a lesbian. The court's decision highlights that justice demands an end to malicious discrimination, but also raises questions about whether institutions should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination. The ruling underscores the ongoing complexities of the debate surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

          <p>Bret Taylor, chairman of OpenAI, advises against letting pride hinder success, recalling Eric Schmidt's advice to Sheryl Sandberg: "If someone offers you a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat, just get on." Flexibility and perspective are crucial in career advancement. Sandberg took a role at Google when it was much smaller. Taylor emphasizes the importance of recognizing unique opportunities and being willing to change plans, both personally and professionally. Most unhappy people rigidly follow plans, missing opportunities and personal fulfillment.</p>

          <p>Shares of UPS are down 24% over the past six months, increasing the dividend yield to record highs. The company is focusing on higher-margin business and trimming low-profit contracts, especially with Amazon. UPS is taking smart steps to position itself for the next economic upswing. The move will let UPS close 73 shipping centers and reduce its annual operating time by 25 million hours. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nebraska Republican Congressman Don Bacon is publicly dissenting from Donald Trump and his party, stating he will not follow them "off the cliff." This stance makes him a rare figure in the GOP, signaling a potential departure from the party. Bacon's decision highlights the internal divisions within the Republican Party and the challenges faced by those who oppose Trump's influence. His dissent suggests a possible shift in the political landscape and a willingness to prioritize principles over party loyalty.</p>
