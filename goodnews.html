          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges related to conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and due process. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties, asserting that he has no criminal history in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration had previously alleged that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. The Supreme Court had previously ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.</p>

Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for the murder of James Appleton and a 50-year sentence for the sexual assault of Amy Harrison, with DNA evidence linking him to the unsolved sexual assault case from 1997.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, despite gains in recent local elections, is struggling to find partners to share power in hung councils. The party isn't involved in any formal coalitions, pacts, or deals in areas with local elections this year, despite speculation about potential Reform-Conservative collaborations. Other parties have viewed Reform UK's policies with suspicion, particularly their focus on national issues like immigration. In some areas, Reform UK's lack of local policy proposals has hindered coalition talks, as established parties seek more comprehensive local agendas.</p>

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a popular Welsh dish of toasted bread with cheese sauce, has varied origin stories. Some believe it originated as a joke by the English, mocking the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves says the dish is associated with Welsh culture and cheese, a vital part of European diets. The name "Welsh rarebit" appeared later in English cookbooks, with no historical evidence linking it to actual rabbits, though some think it was a poor person's substitute for meat.</p>
