          <p>Amid a silver price rally, understanding which silver investments offer the best liquidity is crucial for investors looking to capitalize on gains. This article outlines the easiest forms of silver to sell quickly, with government-minted coins like American Silver Eagles and Canadian Maple Leafs topping the list due to their universal recognition and guaranteed purity. Silver bars from reputable mints are also highly liquid, offering a straightforward way to trade larger quantities. While privately minted rounds and pre-1965 U.S. "junk silver" are also easy to sell for their melt value, silver-backed ETFs provide the most immediate liquidity through brokerage accounts.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, may conclude in the coming months. Speaking at a conference, Powell stated the Fed is nearing its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks but offered no specific guidance on the future direction of interest rates. He acknowledged a softening labor market but noted that the overall economic outlook has not significantly changed, maintaining a cautious stance on future policy moves. This signals a potential shift in one aspect of the Fed's monetary policy, though uncertainty about interest rates remains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Generational Divide in Workplace Values Between Gen Z and Hiring Managers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 12:28:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research highlights a significant values gap between Gen Z employees and the managers who hire them, creating friction in the modern workplace. A study found that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, whereas hiring managers seek candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This disconnect, with only 2% of Gen Z sharing their bosses' top priorities, has led to frustration on both sides and claims that the younger generation is "unemployable." The article advises Gen Z workers to honestly assess their financial goals to determine whether they should adapt to traditional workplace expectations or seek careers that align more closely with their personal values.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Options for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>

          <p>For consumers overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt forgiveness can be an option, though it comes with significant drawbacks. The article explains that while there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs, consumers can negotiate with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a reduced lump sum. However, this process can severely damage one's credit score and may have tax implications. Other potential avenues for relief include bankruptcy, which can offer a complete discharge of debt but has long-term credit consequences, as well as debt consolidation loans and financial hardship programs offered directly by credit card companies.</p>

          <p>Brandon Dawson, an engineer from Santa Rosa, California, won the 52nd World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay with a massive gourd weighing 2,346 pounds. Dawson, who has been growing giant pumpkins for five years, credited the precision skills from his engineering job with helping him manage the pumpkin's growth, which can reach up to 70 pounds per day. He was awarded a $20,000 prize for his victory. The win was particularly sweet for Dawson, who had finished as the runner-up in the previous year's contest by a narrow margin of just six pounds.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported third-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by record-breaking revenue in every one of its business divisions. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, with total revenues up 9% to $22.09 billion, beating analyst forecasts. CEO Jane Fraser attributed the strong performance to the successful execution of the company's strategy and investments in new products, digital assets, and AI. Despite a 9% increase in expenses related to the sale of its Mexico business, Banamex, the bank's shares rose over 3% following the positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, upholding the nearly $1.5 billion he was ordered to pay for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones had falsely claimed the 2012 massacre was a hoax, leading to years of harassment against the families. His lawyers argued for First Amendment protections and claimed the judgment amounted to a "financial death penalty," but the high court declined to hear the case without comment. Jones has yet to pay any of the damages and had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in an attempt to shield his assets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Interior has rejected a bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton. The bid of $186,000 was deemed not to meet the fair market value requirement under the Mineral Leasing Act. This failed sale, which would have been the largest of its kind in over a decade, highlights the declining demand for coal as utilities increasingly shift to cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources. The decision comes despite the Trump administration's efforts to revive the coal industry, which faces strong economic headwinds.</p>

The update also prevents teens from following or interacting with accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, but it raises questions about ownership. The homeowner retains the legal title and ownership of the house; the lender only places a lien on the property to secure the loan. The loan balance, including interest and fees, grows over time and becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or passes away. At that point, the borrower's heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the home or sell the property, pay off the mortgage, and retain any remaining equity.</p>

The manufacturer's production is stabilizing, and CEO Kelly Ortberg expects to increase the 737 Max production rate to 42 per month by the end of the year, pending FAA approval.
