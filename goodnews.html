          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, offering a fresh approach to addressing demographic challenges in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), argued that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the need for innovative solutions increasingly urgent. The findings highlight the importance of addressing traditional expectations that place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties.</p>
