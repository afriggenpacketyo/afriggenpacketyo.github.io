        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that surpassed analyst predictions, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. The Swiss luxury group's revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, reaching 5.17 billion euros, despite a decline in sales within its specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. While full-year sales rose by 4% to 21.4 billion euros, the company acknowledged ongoing global uncertainties that require agility and discipline. BofA Global Research noted that Richemont faces challenges from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, though its pricing power may offset some of these headwinds.</p>

          <p>In a medical first, a 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder known as CPS1 deficiency has been successfully treated with a custom gene-editing therapy. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to correct the specific mutation causing the disorder, which affects only one in 1.3 million babies and often leads to severe developmental delays and liver transplants. The treatment, which was developed rapidly through collaboration between multiple institutions and with the FDA's support, offers a potential new path for developing personalized therapies for other rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare by making such treatments more accessible and affordable. The baby is now well enough for the team to start planning to discharge him from the hospital and live at home, and he is meeting developmental milestones.</p>

          <p>Facing lawsuits and criticism over its potential harm to users' mental health, particularly among children, TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features. The company said it began testing the new meditation exercises with select teens earlier this year and will now make them available to users of all ages. The meditation feature, aimed at improving sleep quality, is triggered during "sleep hours" and will be turned on by default for users under the age of 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to young users, posing risks such as depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. This work could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced major population declines.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is advocating for legislation to regulate artificial intelligence, citing concerns about companies using her likeness and voice without permission. She recounted an incident where OpenAI's Chatbot, named "Sky," sounded eerily similar to her voice, despite her declining an offer to voice the AI. Johansson's legal team took action against an AI image-generating app for using her voice and likeness in an ad. She emphasizes the need for boundaries to prevent AI from being detrimental and for public figures to support this cause.</p>

          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets due to trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since 1996. This shift was attributed to concerns about the U.S. economy and asset performance following the announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs, leading investors to diversify into other major markets, including Japan. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact the appeal of Japanese assets.</p>

The government aims to be fully operational with the measures by 2027.
