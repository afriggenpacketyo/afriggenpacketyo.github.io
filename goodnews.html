          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to consider a face-to-face meeting in June, coinciding with the Group of Seven summit in Canada, to discuss trade tariffs. Both leaders expressed optimism for productive ministerial-level tariff negotiations beforehand, aiming for mutually beneficial bilateral relations. Japan is particularly concerned about the U.S.'s 25 percent import duty on cars and other tariffs impacting its export-driven economy. The leaders also discussed broader bilateral cooperation, including economic security, with Trump sharing insights from his recent diplomatic trip to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>BYD, a Chinese carmaker, has outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking a significant shift in the European car market. BYD's BEV sales surged by 169% year-on-year to 7,231 units, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units during the same period. This milestone comes despite the European Union's imposition of hefty tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. The overall demand for BEVs in Europe continues to rise, accounting for 17% of new car registrations in April, with Chinese firms driving much of this growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gaby Hinsliff discusses the increasing use of the term "DEI hire" as a derogatory label, particularly in online spaces, and its implications for equality and inclusion. The article highlights how this taunt, fueled by Donald Trump's rhetoric against "woke" policies, undermines the achievements of individuals from non-traditional backgrounds. It also touches on the concept of "impostor syndrome," where successful women and minorities fear being exposed as frauds, exacerbated by constant online harassment. The author argues that Britain must actively resist the spread of such prejudices to maintain a fair and inclusive society.</p>

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially halted on-site classes, citing cost-cutting measures, but has now deemed certain courses "effective training." This reversal marks a victory for Emmitsburg, a town heavily reliant on the academy, and for firefighters who argued that the training is essential for emergency management.
