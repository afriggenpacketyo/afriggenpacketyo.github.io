          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 17:10:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in "It Ends With Us," after Lively accused him of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni and his production company failed to adequately allege that Lively's threats constituted wrongful extortion and did not prove defamation. Lively's lawyers hailed the opinion as a complete victory, while Baldoni has the option to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference. This legal battle has been ongoing for several months, stemming from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on set and Baldoni's subsequent defamation suits against Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. The judge also determined that the New York Times did not act with malice in publishing their story. The article highlights the complexities of legal disputes in the entertainment industry and the importance of substantiating claims of defamation. </p>

          <p>A mother discovered that bedding she purchased from Pottery Barn Teen, advertised as "crafted in the USA," was actually made in China, prompting her to report the findings to Truth in Advertising.

The Federal Trade Commission requires that products advertised as "Made in the USA" be all or virtually all manufactured domestically, including ingredients and components.

          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt, and neodymium, which are essential for technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors.

The US is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, leading to efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies.
