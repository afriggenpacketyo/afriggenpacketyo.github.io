        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has announced plans to meet NATO's 2% defence spending target within a year, significantly boosting its military budget. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated this action is necessary to counter threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals. The plan includes investments in soldiers, equipment, military capability expansion, domestic defence industry strengthening, and defence partnership diversification. Carney also noted Canada's reliance on the United States for defence and accused Washington of seeking to "monetise its hegemony" by increasing market access costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to provide $1,000 for so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching the government's contribution if the savings program for newborns becomes law. CEO Michael Dell vowed to match the government's seed money "dollar for dollar" during a White House roundtable with President Trump. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan, which is part of the Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress. The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved Merck‚Äôs RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. The shot aims to protect infants during their first RSV season, with orders expected to begin in July and shipments before the season starts. Enflonsia reduces RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreases hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared to a placebo. This approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year, increasing prospects for infant health.</p>

The key to becoming a millionaire is consistent saving and investing, taking advantage of compounding interest. Investing a small amount of money each month, such as $100, can accumulate to over a million dollars by retirement age. The article emphasizes that financial discipline and long-term investing are more critical than a high income. (not investment advice)</p>
