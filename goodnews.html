          <p>Australians are voting in a national election where President Trump's policies are a significant factor. The center-right coalition's support has declined since Trump took office, while the Labor Party has gained ground, even as leader Anthony Albanese refrains from direct criticism of Trump. The U.S.'s trade relationship with Australia and the AUKUS security pact also play a role, with concerns about Trump's tariffs and China's influence impacting voters' decisions. The level of distrust in the U.S. among Australians has reached a new high, influencing the election dynamics.</p>
