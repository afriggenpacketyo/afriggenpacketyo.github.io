          <p>Indonesia's sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, is set to sign an $8 billion contract with American engineering firm KBR Inc. to construct 17 modular refineries. This significant deal is reportedly part of a broader trade pact between Indonesia and the United States, which also resulted in a reduction of threatened U.S. tariffs. The plan was revealed in a private briefing by Indonesian Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto. This previously unreported contract highlights deepening energy and economic cooperation between the two nations as part of a strategic agreement.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics, a leading Chinese manufacturer of humanoid robots, has announced plans for a share placement in Hong Kong to raise approximately $307 million. The company intends to use the proceeds to support its business operations, including working capital, investments, and loan repayments. This fundraising effort follows several others since its public listing in late 2023, as the company continues to expand its financial base. The announcement coincided with a more than 5% drop in UBTech's share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. This new strategy will freeze the assets of gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of small boat equipment, while also banning them from entering the UK. The move is a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to disrupt the criminal networks facilitating illegal immigration. The announcement comes amid rising numbers of Channel crossings and increasing political pressure to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of US and UK publishers to favor stories from the Balkans that focus on war, trauma, and historical tragedy. She recounts being advised to write about themes specific to her culture's problematic history, revealing an expectation that Balkan literature should serve an explanatory or didactic purpose for Western audiences. Schnabl argues this pattern overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories from the region that explore universal themes without a self-exoticizing lens. She calls for publishers to engage with a wider variety of voices beyond those that reinforce preconceived notions.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The reforms come after a critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues remain subject to further consultation.</p>

The photos show the jets with clear naval markings, including a "Flying Shark" insignia, and official serial numbers, indicating they are part of an initial production run for deployment on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian. A military analyst noted that these details provide the strongest evidence to date that the J-35 has been formally integrated into the People's Liberation Army Navy's carrier aviation force, marking a significant military advancement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a positive side effect by exposing and pressuring other countries to dismantle their own protectionist trade barriers. Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing internal regulations and standards that hinder their own economic potential. The external pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred movement toward creating more unified domestic markets in China and Canada. The piece suggests this forced self-reflection could lead to greater global economic freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the competitive minivan market, the 2025 Toyota Sienna holds a distinct advantage over its rival, the Honda Odyssey, in terms of affordability and fuel economy. The Sienna, a hybrid, starts at a lower price point and offers a combined 36 mpg, significantly higher than the Odyssey's 22 mpg from its V6 engine. While the Odyssey offers more cargo space, the Sienna matches its towing capacity. Both vehicles provide comparable technology and safety features, but the Sienna's efficiency and lower entry cost make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious families.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have accounted for the vast majority of the more than 160 people reported missing after the devastating July Fourth floods, with only three individuals remaining unfound. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, mostly in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. The initial high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists and campers leaving the area without checking in, a common occurrence in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters. Authorities undertook an exhaustive effort to verify each report and locate the individuals.</p>
