          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 14:51:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at a new high, homeowners are considering borrowing through home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have nearly identical interest rates. This article analyzes which option might be cheaper over the summer, suggesting that HELOCs could become the less expensive choice due to their variable rates. If the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated interest rate cuts, HELOC borrowers would benefit quickly. However, the article cautions that this is not guaranteed, as fixed-rate home equity loans offer stability against potential rate increases in an unpredictable economic climate.

          <p>This opinion article frames a hypothetical military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," as a successful strike that destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities under President Trump's command. The author argues that this fictional decisive action contrasts with the approaches of previous presidents who were drawn into prolonged conflicts. The piece posits that Trump's dealmaking abilities are now essential to maintain a fragile ceasefire and prevent a larger war in the Middle East. It concludes by expressing confidence that Trump can secure peace without entangling the U.S. in another quagmire.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, rising 44% and hitting its highest level since its 2021 IPO. The surge is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, citing its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is that legislative clarity could fuel further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are set to begin their Australian tour with a match against the Western Force, with a crowd of over 40,000 expected in Perth.

This tour is considered a crucial, legacy-defining opportunity for Russell, who has had unfulfilling experiences on previous Lions tours. The Western Force, who finished low in the Super Rugby season and are missing key players, are not expected to pose a major challenge to the talented Lions squad.</p>

Conversely, targets were increased for Capital One, CrowdStrike, GE Vernova, Goldman Sachs, and Meta Platforms.

Investors were encouraged by promising updates on new product launches, a renewed focus on female shoppers, and a new partnership to sell on Amazon for the first time since 2019.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that new tariffs would trigger a surge in inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, a practice known as front-loading. Businesses are also absorbing some costs and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments while waiting for more clarity on trade policy. While these short-term strategies have buffered consumers from immediate price shocks, experts warn that inflation could still rise in the latter half of the year if tariffs remain elevated.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of depositing $10,000 into either a high-yield savings account or a money market account. With top rates currently around 4.30% for high-yield savings and 4.32% for money markets, the difference in earnings is minimal. Over one year, a money market account would earn approximately $2 more than a high-yield savings account, assuming rates remain stable. Since both account types have variable rates that could change, the article concludes that savers cannot make a wrong choice between the two for maximizing returns on their cash.

          <p>With many Americans facing significant debt, this article outlines five types of debt that are often eligible for forgiveness or settlement negotiations. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are the most common candidates, as creditors are often willing to accept a lower lump-sum payment rather than risk a total default. Medical bills are also frequently negotiable, with hospitals and providers often offering assistance programs or reduced payment options. While more complex, buy now, pay later plans and high-interest payday loans can also sometimes be settled, though they present greater challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her youth, set against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan. The album explores themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-discovery in her late 20s, but the reviewer finds the result is diluted by a self-consciousness that verges on self-obsession. While praising moments of sonic magic and her skillful vocal delivery, the article critiques the production as feeling like a compromise and the lyrical focus as overly insular. It suggests this once-exciting introspective pop approach may be growing redundant.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace agreement in Washington, D.C., aimed at ending decades of conflict and disarming armed groups in eastern DR Congo. The deal was signed by the two nations' foreign ministers amid a recent escalation in fighting by M23 rebels, who have seized significant territory. The agreement follows a reported offer from the Congolese government to grant the U.S. access to critical minerals in exchange for security assistance. However, details remain scarce, and it is unclear if the deal mandates the withdrawal of thousands of Rwandan troops from Congolese soil.</p>

          <p>Three years after USC and UCLA's departure triggered a mass exodus, the Pac-12 conference has invited Texas State University to become its eighth football-playing member, a move expected to be accepted soon. The addition of Texas State, currently in the Sun Belt Conference, is crucial for the Pac-12 to maintain its status as an NCAA conference. This follows the additions of five Mountain West schools and Gonzaga. The move was encouraged by the Pac-12's new media rights deal with CBS, which will provide a much-needed television and streaming presence for the rebuilt conference starting in 2026.</p>
