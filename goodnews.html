          <p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower, caused by debris from Halley's Comet, is peaking, offering viewers a chance to see meteors streaking across the sky. The shower is best viewed around 2 a.m. local time, away from city lights, with the moon setting around 3 a.m. Although the shower is visible in both hemispheres, conditions are more favorable in the Southern Hemisphere. NASA advises allowing eyes to adjust to the dark for about 30 minutes to fully appreciate the celestial event, which is active until May 21.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has passed a first-of-its-kind bill that increases the state's lodging tax to fund environmental protection and strengthen defenses against natural disasters. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to the existing tax on hotel rooms, timeshares, and vacation rentals, and imposes an 11% tax on cruise ship bills. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects like beach replenishment and clearing flammable grasses. The governor is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>

          <p>Alpine is reportedly preparing to replace driver Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races into the season. This decision comes despite Doohan recently out-qualifying his teammate for the first time this season, but follows a series of incidents including two heavy crashes. Colapinto's potential graduation to the team has been facilitated by financial backing from Latin American sponsors. Doohan is expected to remain involved with Alpine in some capacity.</p>
