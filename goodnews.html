          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits in Hokkaido detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman in her 60s, leading to successful surgery, and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas were also detected among six people. This non-invasive method could be vital in areas with sparse medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have utilized mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct but interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine, known as xiang sheng xiang ke. This approach provides a new understanding of the molecular life mechanisms within this single-celled eukaryote.</p>

These platforms, both online and offline, aim to make homebuying more transparent and efficient. Cities like Chengdu and Suzhou have already rolled out similar initiatives, offering a centralized and vetted source of housing information. The model could improve transaction efficiency by consolidating information and bundling services, such as mortgage applications and property registration.</p>
