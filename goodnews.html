          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares rose significantly after it reported a 53% increase in second-quarter revenue, reaching $658.1 million, driven by robust growth in its USDC stablecoin. Despite a net loss due to one-time charges related to its recent public offering, the company saw USDC circulation grow 90% year-over-year. The strong performance and positive market sentiment are also attributed to a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins. Circle also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain, Arc, to further enhance its financial services platform.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed that headline inflation held steady at 2.7% year-over-year, as falling gas and grocery prices offset other increases. However, economists point to concerning signs beneath the surface, with core inflation rising to a 3.1% annual pace. Experts suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to put upward pressure on the prices of certain goods and services, a trend that is expected to become more pronounced.

Jolie has previously expressed that the divorce proceedings were the primary reason for her remaining in L.A., a city she reportedly never intended to live in full-time, as she seeks more privacy for her family.</p>

          <p>In a bold move, AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Google's Chrome browser, a figure that surpasses Perplexity's own valuation. This bid follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in its antitrust case, where the company was found to hold an illegal search monopoly. Perplexity, which recently launched its own AI-powered browser, stated that it has secured backing from several investors for the potential acquisition.</p>

          <p>As stock market performance remains unpredictable, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure alternative for savers seeking stable returns. This article calculates that with current interest rates, a $100,000 deposit in a CD could earn from over $1,000 on a 3-month term to more than $22,000 on a 5-year term. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed, guaranteed interest rate, which protects the principal investment from market volatility while providing predictable growth over the chosen term.
