This marks Red Bull's first venture into rugby union, adding the club to its extensive global sports portfolio that includes football and Formula 1 teams. The acquisition secures the long-term financial future for the club, which has finished last in the league for three consecutive seasons, and aims to restore its competitive potential.

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to allow Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. The potential deal would require a significant performance reduction, with Trump suggesting a 30% to 50% decrease in capability. This move follows an agreement where Nvidia and AMD pay the U.S. government a 15% share of revenue from Chinese chip sales for export licenses. The strategy aims to keep China dependent on American technology while preventing it from accessing cutting-edge hardware for AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the concept of "abroad" is obsolete in an age of hypersonic missiles, making President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin critically important. It frames the world's geopolitical structure around four superpowers: the U.S. and Israel versus China and Russia. The author praises Trump's realism and toughness, suggesting he is well-equipped to negotiate with Putin without succumbing to illusions. The piece posits that a successful outcome in Ukraine, building on Trump's other foreign policy achievements, is vital for Western security and that hoping for his failure is unpatriotic.</p>

          <p>The UFC has secured a $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, moving away from a pure pay-per-view model to broaden its audience. This strategic shift occurs as an analysis questions whether UFC President Dana White's strong public alliance with Donald Trump could be a liability for the globally diverse brand. The article notes that the UFC's fanbase and roster are more international and politically varied than often stereotyped. With Trump's approval ratings fluctuating and younger demographics being politically independent, the close association with a polarizing figure might alienate as many fans as it attracts.</p>

The service, which will cease on September 30, was pivotal in bringing the internet to many American homes through its ubiquitous free-trial CDs. Dial-up worked by converting computer data into audio signals over phone lines, a process that was slow and prevented simultaneous phone use. While largely replaced by broadband, a small percentage of households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on the service for internet access.</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, has had charges against him dropped after being detained on a remote Antarctic island since June. The 19-year-old was accused by Chilean authorities of illegally landing his plane in their territory by providing a false flight plan. A judge ordered him to leave the area, pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation, and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo was on a mission to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has affirmed the company's commitment to its expansion plans despite receiving a shortened two-year casino license renewal. Singapore's gambling authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance for the reduced term, but RWS is proceeding with its SG$6.8 billion investment. The CEO stated the focus is on transforming RWS into a premium lifestyle destination centered on "experiences" rather than shopping. New attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium have already opened, with more hotels and a Super Nintendo World planned for the coming years.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, pausing the escalation of tariffs for another 90 days until November 10. The move keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, avoiding a significant hike. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and what it calls unfair trade practices. Despite the pause, trade flows between the two economic giants have been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. imports from China down nearly 50% in June compared to the previous year.

The bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially since its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply closer to balance. The decision comes amid a reshaped global trade environment and softer-than-expected domestic economic growth in the first quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mystery surrounding a missing cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend. After her new boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he took her to the remote burial site in Argyll, Scotland. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly dropped a can of Red Bull as a marker and later alerted the police, leading them directly to Parsons' body. McKellar and his twin brother had hit Parsons during a charity ride in 2017 and buried him instead of seeking help.</p>
