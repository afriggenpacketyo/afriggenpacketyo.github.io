          <p>Following Angela Rayner's departure, the contest for the UK Labour Party's next deputy leader is underway, with several prominent figures announcing their candidacy. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, senior MP Emily Thornberry, and the recently dismissed Lucy Powell have all joined the race. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from fellow MPs, a process some critics within the party have called unfair. The competition highlights different ideological wings of the party, with candidates discussing key issues like the war in Gaza, welfare cuts, and the party's overall direction under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, which is central to its economic development goals. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasized that the dam is a source of prosperity and electrification for the region and poses no threat to downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan. Despite these assurances, both countries have long expressed concerns that the dam could jeopardize their water supply from the Nile River. The $5 billion project, funded almost entirely by Ethiopia, is seen as a major national achievement and a symbol of self-reliance.</p>

The new combined entity, to be named Anglo Teck, will become one of the world's top five copper producers and will be headquartered in Canada. The deal is structured to give Anglo American shareholders a 62.4% stake in the new company. The announcement provided a significant boost to European stock markets, which were also monitoring political instability in France.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, following the sudden dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, arrived at Forest's training ground for talks. Nuno's departure after 21 months surprised many of the club's players, especially since he had guided the team to its highest league finish in decades. Postecoglou's potential appointment marks another managerial change under owner Evangelos Marinakis, as the club seeks a new direction.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) has announced an aggressive expansion strategy, aiming to increase its electric car sales in Europe 17-fold over the next two years. The company targets sales of at least 50,000 units by 2027, signaling a significant challenge to established European automakers like BMW and Mercedes. This move will intensify competition in the European EV market, where Chinese brands have already been rapidly gaining market share. To mitigate potential EU tariffs, GAC is also exploring the possibility of establishing local manufacturing facilities in Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better loan terms. Financial experts recommend focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Another key strategy is to increase the down payment, with a 20% down payment not only reducing the rate but also eliminating the need for private mortgage insurance. Finally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial rate.

          <p>India is currently engaged in a strategic rebalancing of its foreign policy, strengthening ties with China and Russia while simultaneously managing trade frictions with the United States. This approach, described by experts as 'multi-alignment' and 'strategic autonomy,' allows New Delhi to navigate an increasingly volatile global landscape without committing to a single bloc. While recent high-level meetings with Chinese and Russian leaders signal a diplomatic outreach, analysts maintain that India is not abandoning its long-term partnership with the U.S. Instead, it is hedging its bets and asserting its right to pursue independent policies.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to reveal its next iPhone lineup, with widespread speculation that the company may announce price increases for the first time in five years. The potential price hike is attributed to the ongoing trade war and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods manufactured in China. The new models are not expected to feature significant technological leaps, which has led to concerns about Apple's pace of innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence. This launch places CEO Tim Cook in a difficult position, balancing consumer pricing, profit margins, and political pressure to move manufacturing to the U.S.</p>

          <p>In his new book, researcher Elliot Haspel argues that to achieve a robust federal child-care system, advocates must reframe the issue as a moral right and a fundamental American value, akin to public schooling. He contends that the prevailing economic argument—that child care is primarily a tool to help parents work—is 'morally impoverished' and fails to build the broad-based coalition needed for transformative change. Instead, the focus should be on the wider societal benefits, such as strengthening families, communities, and even national security, to create a more compelling case for public investment.</p>

The book moves beyond religious iconography to explore the cutting edge of brain science, focusing on noetics and the radical concept of nonlocal consciousness—the idea that the brain acts as a receiver for a consciousness that exists externally. Brown spent eight years researching the topic to craft a thriller where this scientific frontier becomes a potential tool for world domination, blending complex factual research with his signature high-stakes, puzzle-solving narrative style.</p>
