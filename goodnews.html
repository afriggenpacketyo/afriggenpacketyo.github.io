          <p>England's national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match held in Washington, D.C. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning in the area, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of the Americas with a perfect three-win record. Several players also made their England debuts during the heavily rotated match.</p>

          <p>Richard Jefferson, a former teammate of LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers, recently described the intense challenges of playing alongside the basketball superstar. Speaking on a podcast, Jefferson explained that James's extreme competitiveness and demand for excellence could make the experience difficult, comparing it to the high standards of other legends like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. However, he clarified that these "cons" were a natural part of striving for championships at the highest level of the sport.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass casualty attacks, even if they lack a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who research targets or plan violence, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This initiative follows the Southport attack, where the perpetrator's lack of a clear ideology prevented earlier intervention despite his preparatory actions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental and mechanical reset. Betts has been struggling through a career-worst slump, with his batting average falling significantly below his usual standards. The decision was made after just one game following the All-Star break, signaling the team's urgency in helping their key player rediscover his form. Roberts hopes that watching a game from the dugout will provide a beneficial change of perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A discussion is underway in the UK regarding the merits of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help combat "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, believe the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and shortening it could concentrate holiday demand, potentially driving up travel costs further.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage savers to invest in stocks and shares, suggesting the focus on risk has overshadowed potential benefits. The government plans to send information about investment opportunities to people with money in low-interest accounts and is considering changes to the popular tax-free cash ISA accounts. This article explores the challenges of this goal, including the gender gap in investing and the need for better financial education to avoid putting off new, risk-averse investors.
