          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication, orforglipron, demonstrated superior effectiveness in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss in Type 2 diabetes patients compared to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide, Rybelsus. The late-stage study showed Eli Lilly's drug achieved a more significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels and greater average weight loss after 52 weeks. However, experts note the comparison was against a lower dose of the Novo Nordisk drug, suggesting more data is needed to determine a clear winner in the competitive oral GLP-1 market.</p>

          <p>The European Union has unveiled a new strategic agenda aimed at elevating its relationship with India, positioning the nation as a key partner and counterweight to China. This approach, which focuses on enhancing trade and defense-industrial cooperation, contrasts with recent U.S. actions that imposed heavy tariffs on India for purchasing Russian fuel. EU officials believe that fostering a stronger partnership is a more effective way to draw India away from Russia's sphere of influence, emphasizing shared interests in a rules-based global order.</p>

Despite a strong batting performance from Ireland, including half-centuries from Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, England reached the target with more than two overs to spare.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service is expected to announce its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 federal income tax brackets this fall, a move that could provide tax relief for many American households. Projections based on recent inflation data suggest that the income thresholds for each tax bracket will rise, meaning taxpayers will need to earn more to be pushed into a higher tax bracket. This annual process is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay increases result in a higher tax burden without an actual increase in purchasing power.

          <p>Scotland's Parliament has approved a major justice reform bill that will eliminate the country's unique and controversial "not proven" verdict from criminal trials. The reforms will leave only "guilty" and "not guilty" as possible outcomes and will also raise the requirement for a conviction to a two-thirds jury majority. Supporters of the change argue the "not proven" verdict was confusing and failed to provide closure for victims, while critics have expressed concern that its removal could increase the risk of wrongful convictions.</p>
