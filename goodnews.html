          <p>President Trump has reversed his decision to deploy federal forces to San Francisco after holding conversations with prominent tech executives, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump acknowledged the city's reported progress on crime under Mayor Daniel Lurie and cited calls from influential business leaders as the reason for holding off on the deployment. This move is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has favored a less confrontational approach with the administration while welcoming partnerships with existing federal agencies.</p>

This denial followed a media report that caused the stocks of several quantum companies to rise. The administration has recently taken equity in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, arguing the government should benefit from the success of federally funded companies, but it is not currently pursuing this strategy in the quantum space.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill designed to make IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes easier for taxpayers to understand and address. The legislation, now heading to the President's desk, responds to criticism that the current "math error" notices are often unclear about the specific mistake made and the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. Lawmakers supporting the bill argued that ordinary citizens should not have to struggle or hire professionals to decipher basic correction notices from the tax agency.</p>

          <p>This article outlines several aggressive financial strategies for individuals aiming to pay off a substantial $30,000 credit card balance within a single year. Since making minimum payments would take decades, more drastic measures are required. The options discussed include negotiating a debt settlement for a lower amount, transferring the balance to a 0% APR card to eliminate interest, consolidating the debt into a lower-rate personal loan, or, in cases of severe financial hardship, considering Chapter 7 bankruptcy to discharge the debt entirely.

The technology works by detecting an image's subject and background, isolating them into separate layers that move independently as the phone is tilted, creating a subtle depth effect. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to activate this feature within the Photos app and how to set these 3D images as a motion-enabled wallpaper on the lock screen for compatible iPhone models.</p>

          <p>According to reports, Apple is significantly cutting back production of its ultra-thin iPhone Air model due to unexpectedly slow sales since its launch. Sources indicate that customer demand is overwhelmingly favoring the standard iPhone 17 and the more feature-rich iPhone 17 Pro models, leaving the slim Air with virtually no demand. This situation mirrors the lack of consumer interest that led to the discontinuation of previous niche models like the iPhone Mini and suggests a broader market trend away from super-slim smartphones.</p>

          <p>Water companies in England and Wales have been ordered by the regulator Ofwat to refund more than £260 million to customers due to poor performance on issues like pollution and leaks. This penalty comes as the Environment Agency gave the industry its worst-ever collective score for environmental performance in 2024. Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, faces the biggest penalty of £75.2 million. The refunds will be applied as credits on customer bills, though overall water prices are still expected to rise significantly to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>
