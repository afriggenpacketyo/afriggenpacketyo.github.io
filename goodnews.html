          <p>Quantum computing company IonQ has appointed Marco Pistoia, the former head of applied research at JPMorgan Chase, as its new senior vice president of industry relations. Pistoia will focus on helping corporate clients adopt quantum computing and transition to quantum-safe cryptography to protect against future security threats. His hiring reflects the growing race to commercialize quantum technology, which has the potential to break current encryption methods. Pistoia expressed his belief that usable quantum computers are only two to three years away, highlighting the urgency for industries to adapt.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with over a decade of experience shares 15 surprising things homebuyers can negotiate beyond the sale price to save money and reduce stress. These tactics include securing seller credits for closing costs, negotiating a lower mortgage rate through a buydown, and requesting personal property like furniture be included in the sale. The article also advises negotiating for specific repairs, such as a new septic system, which could save a buyer up to $50,000, and outlining clear terms for the home's condition at closing.

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the European Union during meetings in Scotland, narrowly avoiding a looming deadline for new tariffs. The agreement reportedly sets a 15% tariff on most EU imports and includes commitments for the EU to invest $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised the deal for bringing stability and predictability to transatlantic trade, though the framework must still be approved by EU member states and lawmakers.

          <p>Investor Mark Cuban reflects on one of his first entrepreneurial ventures at age 24: selling powdered milk, a business that failed within a month. Despite the setback, he learned a valuable lesson about failure, stating, "You only have to be right one time." For entrepreneurs starting with no money, Cuban advises focusing on sweat equity and providing a service based on their skills. He suggests that if he were starting over today, he would immerse himself in artificial intelligence, learning to use free tools and then teaching small businesses how to leverage the technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for gaining influence and likeability at work. The tactic involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This approach not only shows respect and empathy but also subtly showcases one's competence and helps build trust with colleagues and superiors. Research co-authored by Brooks indicates that the simple act of asking questions makes individuals more likeable, which can positively impact career progression.</p>

Observers suggest the outcome strengthens the coalition's position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.
