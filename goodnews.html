        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steve Tandy, formerly Scotland's defence coach, has been appointed as the new head coach for the Wales men's national rugby team. He will assume the role on September 1st, taking charge until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy's appointment comes at a critical time for Welsh rugby, as the team has struggled recently, briefly dropping to a record-low 14th in world rankings. He expressed excitement about leading the rebuilding phase and helping a group of young, talented players compete at the highest level. His first match will be against Argentina in November.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Federal Law Change Could Lower Manufactured Home Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decades-old federal regulation requiring manufactured homes to be built on a permanent steel chassis may soon be eliminated, potentially making housing more affordable. This obscure rule has long been criticized for increasing costs, limiting design flexibility, and providing a pretext for exclusionary zoning. Housing advocates and industry leaders argue that removing the five-word mandate could scale up production and provide relief for the housing crisis, especially for first-time buyers. After years of legislative inertia, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to consider a bill that would give states flexibility on the chassis requirement, signaling a potential breakthrough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is relaunching the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) revealed that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private pension savings, addressing significant gaps among women and certain ethnic groups. The move follows the success of the original commission, which led to the auto-enrolment system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top Chinese government bodies have called on the nation's automakers to halt the intense price war that has gripped the new energy vehicle (NEV) market. At a symposium with industry leaders, officials emphasized the "extreme urgency" of curbing what they termed "irrational competition." They urged leading companies like BYD to set an example by engaging in lawful and rational market practices. The intervention aims to promote healthy industrial development through better cost oversight and price monitoring, reflecting Beijing's concern that the fierce price-cutting could destabilize the rapidly growing sector.</p>

          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay Amid Discrepancies in League's Financial Picture</h2>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding higher pay, highlighting a significant discrepancy between their compensation and the league's growing financial success. While reports have cited annual losses for the WNBA, other metrics like soaring broadcast rights, increased attendance, and skyrocketing team valuations suggest a much healthier financial reality. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far below their counterparts in other professional sports. The players argue that their salaries, with a rookie minimum of just $66,000, and small roster sizes do not reflect their value or the league's rapid growth.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at regulating toxic ingredients in personal care products sold in the U.S. Currently, federal oversight is minimal, allowing chemicals linked to cancer and reproductive harm to be included in everyday items. The proposed legislation would ban entire classes of hazardous chemicals like phthalates and formaldehyde, require greater supply chain transparency, and fund research into safer alternatives for salon workers and women of color, who are disproportionately exposed. The move seeks to align U.S. standards more closely with stricter regulations in the European Union.</p>

          <p>A long-awaited east-west thoroughfare in Monroe County, Indiana, connecting West Gordon and West Fullerton Pike, is set to be largely completed by early August. The project, which includes a new 500-foot bridge and a roundabout, aims to ease traffic and provide a more direct route to Interstate 69. The total cost has risen to $19.5 million, partly due to unexpected expenses from extensive rock removal, which the county is covering. Local officials are thrilled to see the project, which has been discussed for over 30 years, finally come to fruition before the new school year begins.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," the leader of the violent "Los Choneros" gang, to the United States. Macías, who was recaptured in June after a prison escape, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His gang is known for using hitmen, bribery, and military-grade weapons to control key trafficking routes. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees regarding the respect of his rights. This marks a significant step in the joint efforts between the two countries to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal tests. The bio-inspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and relapse, by mimicking their unique properties. Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the findings detail a method that could lead to the development of personalized cancer vaccines. This breakthrough offers a potential new strategy in the fight against cancer by addressing the root cause of tumor persistence and spread.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on the "power law" principle when deciding which startups to fund, according to European VC Peter Specht. This concept dictates that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, meaning one or two massive successes can outweigh all other losses combined. Consequently, VCs seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential" that can become category-defining companies like Spotify or Klarna. Founders are advised to pitch a compelling vision, demonstrate excellence in a key area, and tell a bold story to convince investors their company can be one of these outliers.</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade agreement that eased some of Beijing's export controls. China, which dominates over 90% of the market for these critical components used in EVs, wind turbines, and other advanced tech, had previously placed restrictions on their export. The sharp increase in shipments reflects a scramble by U.S. firms to secure their supply chains. The situation highlights America's heavy reliance on China for these materials and the strategic leverage Beijing holds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms since privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. The report by Sir Jon Cunliffe makes 88 recommendations to address systemic issues like sewage spills, leaks, and underinvestment. Key proposals include setting minimum capital levels to ensure company resilience and granting powers to block ownership changes not in the public interest. The reforms aim to ensure continuous infrastructure investment and prevent the dramatic bill spikes now required to compensate for past neglect.</p>

          <p>Investors in China are flocking to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing assets under management past $50 billion as of June. This surge, up from just $10 billion at the start of last year, is driven by a search for low-risk, fixed-income assets in an economic environment marked by deflation and weak consumption. These ETFs offer lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity than direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, as investors seek higher yields while hedging against an uncertain economic outlook and an already crowded government debt market.
