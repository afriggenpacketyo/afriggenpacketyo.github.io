        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, though it will not be a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 seats will be chosen by district-level electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president, due to difficulties in creating an accurate voter registry amid mass displacement. The process is being watched as an indicator of the interim government's commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities, especially as elections in some minority-majority regions have been postponed. This parliament will serve a 30-month term to pave the way for future popular elections.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual rather than immediate. The club has heavily invested in its training facilities, which were previously below Premier League standards, and has seen on-field success, including a Carabao Cup victory and Champions League qualifications. However, growth has been constrained by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing the owners from spending limitlessly and forcing a more strategic approach to player development and signings. The club has also expanded off the field, more than doubling its staff and revenue.</p>

          <p>Beijing is shifting its public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers to tour China and create positive content for younger audiences. For the second year, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has funded a trip for popular content creators to showcase the country's culture, scenery, and history, moving away from traditional state-led media campaigns. This soft power initiative aims to connect directly with Gen Z and Millennial Africans and present a side of China not typically seen in news reports. Experts view this as a significant and overdue step to refine China's image on the continent.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir "Truly," music legend Lionel Richie reveals that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before a pivotal moment changed his career path. As a shy young man, he considered the priesthood a viable future until he performed with his college band, The Commodores. During one show, a woman in the audience enthusiastically shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which gave him the validation he needed to pursue music instead. He recalls promptly contacting his priest to inform him he would not be continuing his seminary plans, realizing that his songs would become his true sermons.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is launching a major "Modernization Agenda" to integrate artificial intelligence across public services, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucracy. The plan includes using AI to expedite visa processing, streamline export regulations, and offer more government services online, with an AI avatar of the culture minister already deployed. While officials frame the push as essential for future growth, some experts and researchers express concern over the reliance on US tech companies like OpenAI and the need for scientific guidance and ethical oversight. The initiative highlights a national effort to avoid falling behind in a key technological race.</p>

          <p>The White House is sending envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to Egypt to finalize a Gaza ceasefire deal, following Hamas's acceptance of key parts of a US-led peace proposal. President Trump stated that an agreement is "very close" and that Israel has agreed to an initial withdrawal line, with a ceasefire to begin immediately upon Hamas's confirmation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope of returning all hostages within days but insisted Hamas would be disarmed either diplomatically or militarily. Despite the diplomatic progress, Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, resulting in dozens of Palestinian casualties.</p>
