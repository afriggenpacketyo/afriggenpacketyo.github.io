          <p>Small colleges across the U.S., like Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reviving football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men. Administrators hope the sport will foster a sense of belonging and school spirit, attracting students at a time when male college attendance is declining. While Roanoke saw an immediate influx of nearly 100 student-athletes, research suggests that such enrollment spikes are often temporary and do not produce long-term gains. The trend reflects a broader strategy by smaller institutions to remain competitive and financially viable amid a shrinking pool of potential students.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in conversations about responsible usage. They recommend starting discussions early, exploring the technology together, and teaching critical thinking skills to fact-check AI-generated information. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, there are significant risks, as some chatbots have provided unsafe responses regarding mental health crises. The guidance emphasizes setting reasonable household rules and balancing screen time with real-world interactions to mitigate potential negative impacts on child development.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck early Saturday off the eastern coast of Russia's Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a potential tsunami threat, but this was later rescinded. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the seismic event, and Japanese authorities noted only the possibility of slight sea-level changes.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of adult film actress Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed the account without clear justification and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. While recognizing the need for content moderation, the ruling stated that it must be done proportionately and with transparency. The court has ordered Meta to review and clarify its policies, particularly regarding how it defines and moderates implicit sexual content.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team faces a formidable challenge against England in the World Cup quarter-final, a team they have not defeated in over 25 years. The historical gap between the two teams is attributed to England's early investment, larger player pool, and more developed professional pathways. Despite the lopsided record, Scotland has shown significant improvement in recent years, rising to sixth in the world rankings. The match represents a critical moment for Scottish women's rugby, with hopes that a strong performance can secure better contracts and continued investment in the sport's future.</p>

          <p>The upcoming fight between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford is generating significant debate, with experts divided on the outcome. Crawford's supporters point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and speed, believing he can expose a perceived decline in Álvarez's performance, similar to how Floyd Mayweather Jr. did. Conversely, those backing Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage, as Crawford is moving up two weight classes. They argue that while Crawford is a master boxer, Álvarez's ability to control distance and deliver powerful blows will ultimately be too much for the smaller fighter to handle.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 04:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Münster in Germany have developed a new mechanical method to recycle electric vehicle battery materials without using hazardous chemical solvents. The process uses mills to grind up production scraps and separate valuable cathode materials from their metal backing, preserving them for immediate reuse. This breakthrough targets batteries made with a dry process using a plastic binder, a newer manufacturing technique. The innovation could significantly lower production costs, reduce environmental harm from waste, and ultimately make electric vehicles and energy storage systems more affordable for consumers.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, calm is returning to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been sworn in as the interim prime minister, becoming the first woman to hold the office in the nation's history. The "GenZ" protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations. In response to the political shift, the president has dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5, marking a significant transition for the country.</p>

          <p>This article speculates on the significance of Cristiano Ronaldo's potential return to play in the United States for the first time in over a decade. A friendly match between Portugal and the US is reportedly in discussion, which would mark Ronaldo's first appearance in the country since facing sexual assault allegations in 2017, which he has always denied and which did not result in charges. The author suggests his long absence has been a calculated move to avoid negative publicity and potential legal issues. A return now, especially ahead of the World Cup, could signal a change in circumstances, possibly influenced by the current political climate.</p>
