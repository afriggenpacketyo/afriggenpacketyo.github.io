          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime insider of the Trump administration, has resigned from her position as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Sources indicate she is the highest-ranking official to leave voluntarily during the president's second term. Mailman, who served throughout the first term, was considered a key figure in establishing the operational framework of the second White House. She plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue as a special government employee to finalize some of her policy work, including negotiations with Harvard University over research funding.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey retreat. The aircraft was one of five unauthorized incursions over the weekend, with flares used in this instance to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the area. NORAD officials emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and burn out completely, posing no danger to people on the ground. Pilots are being strongly urged to check all FAA notices before flying.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a new AI model, Genie 2, that can generate playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. During a 60 Minutes report, researchers showed how a photograph of a waterfall was transformed into a first-person game world that an AI agent could explore. This technology represents a significant leap in generative AI, with implications for entertainment, gaming, and robotics. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that the primary goal is to build a "world model" that can train AI agents and robots in a vast array of simulated environments before they operate in the real world.</p>

          <p>The practice of elective egg freezing is rapidly increasing among American women, with many viewing it as a revolutionary way to manage their reproductive timelines, similar to the advent of the birth control pill. A 60 Minutes report explores how the procedure allows women to delay childbirth for personal or professional reasons without the immediate pressure of a "biological clock." While proponents celebrate this as empowerment, bioethicists caution that it is not a guaranteed path to motherhood and raises concerns about high costs, medical risks, and societal pressures on women to delay having children.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicts that artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within five to ten years. In a 60 Minutes interview, the Nobel laureate suggested that AI could revolutionize human health, potentially curing all diseases within a decade by dramatically accelerating drug development. Hassabis also envisions AI leading to "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity, but he cautions about the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of keeping powerful, autonomous systems aligned with human values.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred about 10 kilometers below the surface. While there were no reports of damage or injuries, residents described a loud boom and a shaking sensation that felt like an impact. The event follows a much larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April 2024, but officials noted that a quake of this smaller magnitude is not expected to cause significant issues.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced a left engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, prompting the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787 was ascending when the crew reported the failure to air traffic control and requested to return to the airport. The aircraft landed safely without incident, and there were no injuries among the 219 passengers and 11 crew members on board. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline arranged for alternative travel for all affected customers.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a plume of ash and gas miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake shook the region. While officials state there is no immediate threat to the sparsely populated area, an aviation alert was issued. Seismologists suggest the events are likely related, theorizing that while the quake did not directly cause the eruption, its seismic waves could have destabilized a volcanic system that was already close to erupting.</p>

          <p>Electronics manufacturer Amphenol is reportedly in the final stages of a deal to acquire the connectivity and cable solutions unit of CommScope Holding. The transaction is valued at approximately $10 billion, including debt, and could be announced as soon as Monday. This potential acquisition follows CommScope's previously reported exploration of a sale for this division, which is its largest by sales and operating income. This move would significantly expand Amphenol's footprint in the communication network infrastructure market, building on its 2024 purchase of CommScope's wireless network businesses.

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office but experienced a steep 66% drop in its second weekend, earning $40 million. This decline is notably larger than that of Marvel's previous film, "Thunderbolts." The superhero movie's global total has reached $369 million. New releases, including the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the parody "The Naked Gun," took the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Analysts note that while the summer box office started strong, its overall success will depend on the longevity of upcoming films.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly become a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year. This growth is driven primarily by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on streamlined regulations and favorable economics, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas. However, the state's momentum faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and emerging grid constraints. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which maintained power through Hurricane Ian, demonstrates the resilience and potential of localized, renewable energy systems.
