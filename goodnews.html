        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Blake Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and others in a legal feud that began in December 2024. The judge dismissed Baldoni's defamation claim against The New York Times, stating the Times reviewed available evidence and reported what it believed happened, lacking obvious motive to favor Lively. Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a victory and plan to seek attorneys' fees, treble damages, and punitive damages against Baldoni. The initial complaint filed by Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of their film, which Baldoni denied, leading to the countersuit alleging a false narrative and smear campaign. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing demand for critical minerals like lithium, copper, and cobalt is vital for clean energy technologies, including solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. A UN Secretary-General highlighted the opportunity for developing countries to create jobs and diversify economies through these minerals if managed properly. The US is a major consumer but not a significant producer, leading to government efforts to increase domestic production and build a strategic mineral stockpile. As the demand for clean energy expands, scientists are exploring alternative materials and more efficient mining methods to mitigate supply constraints and environmental burdens, as lithium use is projected to increase drastically by 2040. </p>

Ian Bryant, a pensioner earning over ¬£35,000, supports the government's decision to reinstate the payment for lower-income individuals.
