          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen recorded the fastest time in Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, demonstrating strong pace ahead of the weekend's main events. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was second, just over a tenth of a second behind. In contrast, title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri of McLaren faced significant challenges, with Piastri finishing a distant 12th and Norris fourth, both struggling to match the leading pace. McLaren's long-run pace also lagged, particularly Piastri's, suggesting a difficult weekend may be ahead for the team.

          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours diminish, particularly in northern UK regions like Orkney and Shetland, many people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression, characterized by low mood and anxiety, affects over a million people in the UK. Experts from the University of Glasgow's 'Living with Sad' project are promoting "Wintering Well" boxes, offering therapeutic lamps and activity guides to help islanders manage symptoms. The article emphasizes redesigning interior spaces with light and adopting a positive "mind-shift towards winter" to combat the effects of reduced daylight and improve mental health.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves not to reduce the tax-free allowance for Cash ISAs in the upcoming Budget, arguing it would not effectively promote an investment culture. While the Chancellor reportedly considered reducing the allowance to £10,000 to encourage stock and shares investments, these plans faced strong opposition from banks and consumer campaigners. With a £22bn budget shortfall, Reeves is under pressure to raise taxes or cut spending. The article highlights that Cash ISAs are widely used, holding £360bn, and cutting the limit is unlikely to shift savings into riskier investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises: Is Learning Manual Driving Still Essential Amidst Rise of Automatics?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing debate surrounds whether learning to drive a manual car remains an essential skill, as automatics now constitute one-third of UK cars, driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel sales. Many young drivers face a dilemma, with automatic lessons often being more expensive or less available, despite a lower pass rate for automatic tests. While a manual license offers flexibility, some argue its necessity diminishes with the shift to electric vehicles. This article explores the personal choices and practical considerations for new drivers, highlighting the evolving landscape of driving education and vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>Counting is scheduled to begin today for the Irish presidential election, which saw voters go to the polls yesterday to select the country's 10th president. The two main contenders are Catherine Connolly, an independent politician backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, the Fine Gael candidate. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew from the race due to controversy but his name remains on the ballot paper. Unofficial indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, possibly falling below the 2018 record low. The official result is expected to be announced later this evening at Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has become a popular supplement, with its global market nearing £3bn, driven by social media influencers promoting its benefits for sleep, digestion, and mental health. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including nerve function and blood sugar regulation, dietitians emphasize that supplements are only effective if a deficiency exists, which is difficult to diagnose. The article highlights that while some individuals report positive effects, strong scientific evidence for widespread benefits in healthy populations is limited. It warns against excessive intake and recommends prioritizing diet before supplements, especially for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ruled that UCLA must publicly release the Trump administration's $1.2 billion settlement proposal, a significant victory for faculty seeking transparency. The 28-page document outlines federal demands for policy changes at UCLA concerning antisemitism complaints, admissions, and gender identity, after the Department of Justice accused UCLA of violations and suspended research funding. UCLA had argued public disclosure would harm negotiations, but the court denied their appeal. The UCLA Faculty Association plans to distribute the document publicly, believing it's crucial for understanding potential federal interference in state institutions and ensuring accountability.</p>
