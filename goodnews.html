          <p>Miami Marlins pitcher Ryan Weathers was struck in the head by a throw from his catcher during warmups before a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Weathers was visibly in pain but initially remained in the game, pitching a scoreless first inning. However, he was later removed from the game after three innings for precautionary reasons and will undergo further evaluation. The Marlins have been struggling this season, and the incident adds to their challenges despite Weathers' strong performance in his recent starts; the team will be looking for more positive news after his evaluation.</p>
