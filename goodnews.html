          <p>President Trump received a lavish welcome from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, underscoring the strong diplomatic and business ties between the two nations. The welcome included fighter jet escorts, Arabian horse riders, and a tour of the Royal Court's opulent surroundings. Trump expressed his affinity for the Saudi royals, highlighting their understanding of his tastes and desires, with the article noting the Saudi royals are his family's business partners. The president also attended the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, viewing models of Saudi megaprojects and a gallery showcasing the history of Saudi-American partnership, before touring Diriyah, the ancestral home of the Saudi royal family. The article draws a comparison between the Saudi royal's gold leaf decor and Trump's affinity for gold in his personal residences.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years. The judge cited their remarkable work in prison, including educational courses and programs for inmates, as a factor in the decision. During the hearing, the brothers delivered emotional statements, expressing remorse for their actions and acknowledging the pain they caused their family. The Los Angeles County District Attorney opposed the resentencing, arguing the brothers have not fully taken responsibility for their crimes, but the judge ultimately ruled in favor of resentencing, noting that the previous sentence was justified at the time. A parole board hearing is scheduled for next month to determine their potential release.</p>

          <p>India has publicly refuted President Trump's claims regarding U.S. mediation efforts in the recent cease-fire between India and Pakistan. Trump stated he offered trade incentives and warnings to both countries, leading to the cessation of hostilities, however, an Indian official denied that trade was discussed during the conversations between Indian and U.S. leaders. This public contradiction highlights India's concern about how its public perceives its military actions and its relationship with the U.S. The article notes that India has long tried to isolate Pakistan as a small problem that it can handle on its own, and Trump's statements undermined that effort.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of French nuclear weapons in Europe, noting that the United States already stations nuclear-armed aircraft in the region. Macron emphasized that any expansion of France's nuclear deterrence would be subject to conditions, including maintaining France's own defense capabilities and retaining sole control over the weapons' use. Germany and other Eastern European nations have shown interest in the proposal, driven by concerns about the reliability of the U.S.' nuclear commitment to Europe amid the ongoing threat from Russia. Macron clarified that France does not want to provoke "World War III" over the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A duck has been caught speeding on traffic cameras in Koeniz, Switzerland, clocking in at 52km/h in a 30km/h zone. Local police said the mallard was snapped on radar images on April 13. Adding to the mystery, authorities said the duck was likely a repeat offender and shared an image of a similar-looking duck traveling in the same spot, at the same speed, and on the same date in 2018. The incident has sparked speculation about whether the "notorious racer" duck incident was a belated April Fool's joke, but the police inspectorate said it is impossible to manipulate images on the radar system.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg is making a series of appearances, including a town hall in Iowa, which have prompted speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. He criticized the Trump administration's policies, particularly regarding veterans' affairs and tax cuts for the wealthy, while imploring attendees to exert pressure on their representatives to block cuts to federal agencies. The article notes that Buttigieg has shown interest in winning back working-class voters and disenchanted Americans who gravitated to Trump. He also acknowledged that the Democratic Party had done a poor job last year by insisting that the economy was doing well by traditional metrics even as voters were consistently expressing financial frustration.</p>
