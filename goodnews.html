          <p>England's cricket team has named 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker in the squad for his international debut in the first one-day international against South Africa. Baker's selection comes after an impressive performance in The Hundred tournament, where he consistently bowled at high speeds and effectively challenged world-class batters. Captain Harry Brook praised Baker's skill and high pace, noting that he was a standout player during the season. The match marks the beginning of a three-match series against South Africa, with England fielding a team that includes both seasoned players and emerging talent like Baker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares on its services in a government-backed move to make rail travel more affordable and encourage commuters to shift from cars to trains. This policy is expected to reduce ticket prices on some key routes, like Edinburgh to Glasgow, by nearly 50%, providing significant savings for passengers amid cost-of-living pressures. The initiative follows a pilot program and aims to increase passenger numbers and provide environmental benefits. The Scottish government anticipates the annual cost to be between £40 million and £45 million, which will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased ridership.

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te has appointed two younger officials, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, both in their thirties, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. This move is seen as an effort to bring fresh perspectives to the council as Taiwan navigates complex relations with Beijing and the United States. The appointments follow a significant drop in approval ratings for Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party, particularly among young voters. By blending veteran experience with younger talent adept at responding to global changes, Lai aims to strengthen the council's capabilities in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political analysis suggests that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda is closely following the playbook of Michelle Obama's 2010 "Let's Move!" campaign. Both initiatives aim to combat poor public health by targeting processed foods and encouraging healthier lifestyles, though MAHA adopts a more confrontational tone toward the food industry. While Obama's campaign relied on celebrity endorsements and voluntary corporate pledges with mixed results, Kennedy's approach also pressures companies for change rather than implementing new regulations. The article questions whether this strategy will be more effective now, given the limited long-term success of its predecessor.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's expanded government-funded childcare scheme has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of weekly childcare for children aged nine months to four years. While the program is intended to save families up to £7,500 annually, many parents report facing long waiting lists and a shortage of available nursery places. Childcare providers warn that staffing shortages are a key barrier to meeting the increased demand, with an estimated 35,000 more staff needed. Some parents have even made decisions like scheduling C-sections to align with funding eligibility deadlines, highlighting the immense pressure and complexities of the new system.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant shake-up of his Downing Street staff, creating new roles and streamlining his leadership team to accelerate the government's policy delivery. The changes include the creation of a new Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister position and a consolidation of policy and communications roles. This restructuring is seen as an admission that the first year of his premiership has not met expectations and reflects a renewed focus on economic expertise ahead of the critical autumn budget. The move aims to establish clearer command structures and address internal criticisms that the government machine has been sluggish and lacked a clear vision.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reached an agreement with Royal Antwerp to sign Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for an initial fee of £18.1 million, plus add-ons. The 23-year-old is set to sign a five-year contract, with the club viewing him as a promising talent for the future. The signing addresses United's recent goalkeeping issues and ends their pursuit of Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez. Lammens, who has yet to make his senior international debut for Belgium, is seen as a potential long-term successor to Thibaut Courtois for the national team.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has suspended its military-operated propaganda radio broadcasts aimed at North Korea as part of an effort to de-escalate military tensions on the peninsula. The "Voice of Freedom" program, which has been on and off the air since 1962, transmitted outside information and K-pop music into the heavily restricted nation. This action is the latest in a series of conciliatory measures by President Lee Jae Myung's administration, which has also halted loudspeaker broadcasts along the border. Despite these moves, North Korea has shown little interest in improving relations, recently calling President Lee a "hypocrite."</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has reached a £55 million agreement with Brentford to sign forward Yoane Wissa.

The transfer comes as Newcastle looks to strengthen its attack following the record-breaking sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, a 28-year-old DR Congo international, is now traveling to Newcastle to complete the move before the transfer deadline.</p>

The new six-story complex, which cost $350 million to build alongside an adjacent office conversion, features high-end amenities like a resort-style pool, a pet spa, and townhouse-style units. The rest of the former mall is being converted by UCLA into a major research facility, creating a new hub of activity in the area.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have voted overwhelmingly to unionize, with over 600 staffers now represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees. The successful union drive follows mass firings and proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration, which have left park staff feeling vulnerable and overworked. Workers cite rock-bottom morale, low pay, and poor housing conditions as long-standing issues that have been exacerbated by recent policies. The unionization effort aims to provide job protections and a platform for employees to advocate for better working conditions amid increasing visitor numbers and depleted staffing levels.</p>

          <p>The Altadena Town & Country Club, a century-old community institution in Southern California, has partially reopened eight months after it was destroyed in the devastating Eaton fire. The club, which served as a vital hub for recreation, employment, and community events, celebrated its return with members gathering at the newly restored pool and tennis courts. The January firestorm caused widespread destruction in the area, killing at least 31 people and destroying thousands of structures. The club's reopening is seen as a significant and healing step for a community still grappling with the fire's aftermath and the displacement of many residents.</p>

The new building, designed by Peter Zumthor and set to open in 2026, features a non-chronological, interwoven exhibition plan.

          <p>Royal Mail has reported an annual profit of £12 million, its first in three years, following its acquisition by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group. The turnaround marks a significant milestone for the 500-year-old postal service, which has struggled with financial losses, staff strikes, and a decline in letter volumes. The company's shift in focus towards more profitable parcel deliveries has started to yield positive results, with parcel volumes increasing by 6% while letter volumes declined by 4%. The new ownership has committed to maintaining key services while continuing to modernize the business. (not investment advice)</p>
