          <p>A minor collision occurred between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday night. The incident involved two Delta Connection flights, operated by Endeavor Air, resulting in the wing of one aircraft making contact with the fuselage of the other. A flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was treated at the scene before being taken to a hospital, but no passengers were harmed. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which caused no significant disruption to overall airport operations. Passengers were deplaned and provided with accommodations and alternative travel arrangements.</p>

          <p>A new report from wealth intelligence firm Altrata predicts a significant generational shift among the world's ultra-wealthy, with millennials and Gen Z poised to control over a third of this group's assets by 2040. Currently, baby boomers dominate the population of individuals worth at least $30 million, but the ongoing "great wealth transfer" will rapidly change this dynamic. This transition is expected to have far-reaching implications for industries catering to the rich, from finance to luxury goods, as younger generations have different priorities and sources of wealth, with a stronger focus on technology and entertainment. Firms are being advised to adapt their strategies to cater to these emerging preferences and values. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of parents are installing landline phones for their children as a way to foster communication skills without the risks associated with smartphones and social media. This trend reflects rising concerns about the impact of digital technology on youth mental health, popularized by books like "The Anxious Generation." Companies like Tin Can are now marketing retro-style phones specifically for kids, emphasizing a distraction-free connection. For children, the appeal lies in the novelty and tactile nature of an "old-timey" device, offering a low-pressure introduction to phone conversations while avoiding the complexities of the online world.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny has been officially announced as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, a decision that has sparked both celebration and controversy. The choice of the Puerto Rican artist, known for his Spanish-language hits and politically charged music, is seen as a major cultural moment for the Latino community. While supporters praise the NFL for recognizing his immense popularity, some conservative commentators have criticized the selection, citing his past critiques of the Trump administration and support for Puerto Rican independence. The announcement underscores the Super Bowl's massive cultural influence and the business logic of catering to a diverse and growing fanbase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, deepens the existing relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a substantial stake in Occidental.</p>

          <h2>Waymo's Cautious Approach to Self-Driving Technology Contrasts with AI Industry's Rush</h2>

          <p>Waymo's deliberate and slow-paced development of its autonomous vehicle technology stands in stark contrast to the "move fast and break things" ethos prevalent in the broader AI industry. While AI chatbots from major tech companies have been rushed to market with notable flaws, Waymo has spent 16 years meticulously collecting data to build a strong safety record, reporting 91% fewer serious injury accidents than human drivers. This cautious strategy, though costly and yet to be profitable, highlights a different path for AI development where physical-world stakes are high. Experts agree that Waymo's safety record is undeniably strong, offering a potential lesson for other AI developers.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has declared a race a 'heat hazard,' with this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix set to test new driver safety measures. With temperatures predicted to exceed 31°C amid high humidity, teams are now permitted to use driver cooling vests. This rule was introduced following the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, where extreme conditions left several drivers on the verge of collapse. While use of the vests is not mandatory, all cars must be fitted with the system to ensure weight parity. Drivers have had mixed reactions to the technology, with some finding it effective while others consider it uncomfortable.</p>

          <p>Following the death of President Russell M. Nelson, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is set to name former Utah Supreme Court justice Dallin H. Oaks as its new leader. The succession process is a well-established tradition where the longest-tenured member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles automatically becomes the new president, ensuring a smooth and predictable transition. This hierarchical structure has been in place for over a century to prevent internal lobbying. The formal announcement of the new president, who is considered a prophet by members, will occur after President Nelson's funeral, with the Quorum leading the church in the interim.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, who has successfully won two elections in a state heavily favoring Donald Trump, is now considering a presidential campaign. In an interview with NPR, Beshear discussed his belief that Democrats need to change their approach to win back voters in rural and red-state areas. He emphasized the importance of showing respect, finding common ground, and focusing on issues that impact all Americans. By positioning himself as a common-sense leader who can succeed in politically challenging environments, Beshear is making a case for why a Democrat from a red state could be a viable national candidate.</p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the alarming rise in cancer diagnoses among adults under 50 may be partially a "diagnostic mirage." While incidence rates for certain cancers have nearly doubled since 1990, the study found that death rates have remained flat, and rates of metastatic cancer have not increased at the same pace. The researchers argue this indicates an "epidemic of diagnosis" rather than an epidemic of disease, where improved screening technologies are detecting cancers that might never have become clinically significant. However, other experts caution against oversimplifying the trend, noting that mortality has genuinely increased for specific cancers like colorectal and uterine.</p>

          <p>Officials for Munich's Oktoberfest have dismissed the idea of extending the festival, despite a temporary closure caused by a bomb threat on Wednesday. A German hospitality association had suggested adding a day as a sign of resilience, but festival organizers cited practical challenges, including staffing shortages and expiring contracts, making a last-minute extension unfeasible. The festival grounds were shut down for several hours after police linked a bomb threat to a fire at a nearby house. Authorities have since reassured the public that no risks remain, and the event has resumed normal operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a general consensus among food lovers about what makes a good pasta shape, certain inferior varieties like farfalle, penne, and wagon wheels continue to persist on store shelves. Culinary experts argue that superior shapes excel at cooking evenly and effectively holding sauce, qualities often lacking in their less-regarded counterparts. The continued existence of these "bad" shapes is largely attributed to nostalgia and their frequent use in potluck dishes like pasta salad, where convenience often outweighs culinary excellence. While some chefs harbor a deep disdain for shapes like penne, others argue that even a maligned pasta can find its purpose in the right dish, suggesting a place for every noodle.</p>

          <p>Spencer Elden, the man photographed as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind," has lost his lawsuit against the band. A U.S. District Judge ruled that the iconic image does not constitute child pornography, stating that the context does not suggest sexually explicit conduct. Elden had sued the band and the photographer in 2021, arguing he was a victim of commercial sexual exploitation. The judge likened the photo to a family picture of a child bathing and noted that Elden had previously embraced his connection to the album cover. Elden's legal team has announced plans to appeal the decision.</p>

The move is part of a broader land reform program aimed at addressing one of the key drivers of the conflict.
