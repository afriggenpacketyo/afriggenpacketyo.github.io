          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing face challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited housing inventory, though strong credit can still secure favorable terms. As of September 15, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are 6.53%, with 15-year rates at 5.71%, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest the Federal Reserve's potential pause on rate hikes could offer some relief, but borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles and compare lenders to find the best options. This article provides a snapshot of the current market, emphasizing strategic steps for securing competitive rates in a fluctuating economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced a $5 billion investment to construct a new manufacturing facility in Goochland County, Virginia, aimed at significantly boosting its production capacity for targeted cancer drugs and other advanced treatments. This facility represents the first of four new U.S. manufacturing plants planned by the drugmaker, part of a broader $27 billion investment since 2020 to enhance domestic production. The site will focus on developing active ingredients for bioconjugate and monoclonal antibody drugs, including antibody drug conjugates used in cancer and autoimmune conditions. CEO Dave Ricks indicated the decision was influenced by favorable U.S. tax policies and the company's expanding pipeline, signaling a strategic shift of some production from Europe.</p>

          <p>China's recently launched Global Governance Initiative (GGI), unveiled at the UN's 80th anniversary, represents its most comprehensive vision for reshaping the international system. Experts view the initiative as an attempt to foster a multipolar world where developing nations gain greater influence, contrasting sharply with former President Trump's transactional diplomacy and unilateral measures. The GGI emphasizes inclusive multilateralism, sovereign equality, and development without ideological conditions, reflecting China's ambition to fill a perceived void as U.S.-led multilateralism faces increasing scrutiny. This article examines the potential for China's new framework to significantly alter global decision-making power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Cosco Shipping Specialised Carriers has launched China's first direct break-bulk shipping route to Peru's strategic Chancay port, with the vessel Greensuape departing from Suzhou carrying over 30,000 tonnes of cargo. This new monthly service specializes in transporting irregular and oversized goods, unlike standard container ships, with its maiden voyage delivering grinding balls crucial for Peru's mining industry. The direct route is expected to significantly streamline the supply chain for mineral processing plants in Chancay, enhancing efficiency and safeguarding stable operations. This development strengthens economic ties and trade infrastructure between China and Peru.</p>

          <p>Recent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests for electric vehicles revealed varied safety performances. Four out of seven EVs, including the BMW i4 and Tesla Cybertruck, earned "good" ratings in simulated head-on collisions. However, the Nissan Ariya received a "marginal" rating due to high risk of chest injuries for rear passengers, and the Ford F-150 Lightning scored "poor" for similar reasons, with concerns about seatbelt positioning. While most vehicles performed well in pedestrian crash avoidance, headlight ratings were mixed. Automakers like Ford and Nissan acknowledged the results, stating commitments to continuous safety improvement.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has announced his intention to seek a historic third consecutive term, emphasizing his administration's policy achievements and appealing for unity. His stated priorities for a new term include combating fraud, increasing healthcare affordability, investing in public schools, and seriously addressing gun violence, particularly in light of recent tragic incidents. Walz faces significant political challenges, with polling data suggesting many Minnesotans are hesitant about a third term and his administration drawing scrutiny over its handling of high-profile fraud cases.
