          <h2>Senate Approves Modest Spending Reduction Bill Amid Republican Divisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:26:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a revised $9 billion spending cuts package, a key priority for the Trump administration. The legislation, which targets funds for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, revealed significant rifts within the Republican party. Several GOP senators, including former leader Mitch McConnell and Lisa Murkowski, initially opposed procedural votes, creating dramatic tensions before the bill ultimately advanced. This contentious process highlights the difficulty the administration faces in enacting even modest fiscal reductions, despite controlling the chamber. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the U.S. Federal Reserve's function and the ongoing friction between President Trump and its chair, Jerome Powell. The Fed operates independently to manage monetary policy with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Trump, who appointed Powell, has repeatedly criticized him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. The conflict also extends to a dispute over the cost and scope of renovations at the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, granting Juul authorization to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The agency concluded that the products can benefit public health by helping adult smokers switch from more harmful traditional cigarettes. This decision is a major milestone for Juul, which has faced years of litigation and public criticism for its alleged role in the teen vaping epidemic. Anti-tobacco advocates strongly condemned the move, calling it a step in the wrong direction.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to begin producing its soda with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he championed for its superior taste. The change aligns with sentiments from health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has criticized corn syrup. However, the article's analysis points out that from a health perspective, the metabolic effects of cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nearly identical. The move is framed as a symbolic, populist victory for the administration.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is considering changes to its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current 3.4-ounce rule, suggesting it could be the next major policy change following the recent elimination of the requirement to remove shoes at security checkpoints. This review is enabled by the deployment of new CT scanning technology at airports, which provides more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be up to 1.5 million years old, the oldest ever retrieved, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will carefully melt sections of the 2.8-kilometer core, drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study ancient dust, ash, and gases trapped inside. This research aims to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history, particularly a mysterious period when the planet's ice age cycles suddenly changed. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was primarily driven by a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite this moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This maintains pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates, even as the country faces economic growth concerns due to U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Medical experts confirm the White House's assessment that the condition is generally benign and manageable, often treated with non-surgical methods like compression stockings, leg elevation, and maintaining an active lifestyle.</p>
