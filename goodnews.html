          <p>President Javier Milei is focusing on unlocking Argentina's copper potential to capitalize on increasing global demand for electrification and renewable energy. Milei's administration hopes the mining sector can play a key role in stabilizing the economy. The Large Investment Incentive Regime aims to attract large-scale investors with tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits. Companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are investing in Argentina's copper and lithium potential. While Argentina faces policy consistency and social license challenges, analysts estimate the copper projects could represent a $47 billion opportunity for the economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in a wild NFL season opener that included a lightning delay and an ejection. Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns, and Saquon Barkley added another, leading the Eagles to an early lead. However, Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting on Dak Prescott, shifting the game's momentum. The game was delayed for 65 minutes due to lightning, and neither team scored after the resumption. Despite undisciplined moments and penalties, the Eagles' defense held strong, securing the victory.</p>

          <p>The outgoing head of the British armed forces, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, stated that the UK's national security is safe "for now and for the next few years." He attributes this to the UK's status as a nuclear power and its membership in NATO. Sir Tony praised the Western allies' "coalition of the willing" discussing post-war Ukraine, viewing it as a broader effort for European security. He also commended former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sir Tony urged "scepticism" against arguments of a new non-NATO "axis" forming.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his warning of "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S. He indicated firms like Apple, with domestic expansion plans, would be exempt. Trump stated that companies building or planning to build in the U.S. would not face tariffs. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies committing billions to building plants in the U.S. Trump offered few details, but the dinner saw tech leaders praising his pro-business and AI stances.</p>

          <p>Bidders seeking to buy a portion of Starbucks’ China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at as much as US$5 billion. The offers would allow Starbucks to proceed with the sale in a market facing sluggish growth and stiff competition. Most bids valued Starbucks China at about 10 times its expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of US$400 million to US$500 million in 2025. The multiple that bidders offered is similar to one of its main rivals, Luckin Coffee.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20, but the game was overshadowed by Jalen Carter's ejection for spitting on Dak Prescott. Carter approached Prescott before a play, exchanged words, and spat on him, leading to his immediate removal. The incident occurred just six seconds into the game, marking one of the quickest ejections in NFL history. Despite the ejection, the Eagles overcame the early setback and secured the win. The game was also interrupted by a 65-minute lightning delay in the third quarter.</p>
