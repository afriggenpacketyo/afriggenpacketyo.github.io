          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to, and in some cases surpassing, the United States in key technological areas, particularly in artificial intelligence. They highlight China's swift development of AI models, open-source initiatives, and the widespread adoption of Chinese apps globally. The authors warn that the U.S. must learn from China's successes, share AI technologies more openly, and accelerate innovation to maintain its competitive edge. They emphasize that the future of technology, and global leadership, depends on the U.S. adapting to this new reality.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations was primarily attributed to the yen's depreciation. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, mainly due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>

This issue was cited by 21.9 percent of over 4,000 respondents as their top concern. While the figure has improved slightly from the previous year, many visitors reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks.</p>
