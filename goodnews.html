          <p>Microsoft has recently recruited approximately two dozen employees from Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence lab to bolster its own AI division. This talent acquisition includes high-level executives like Amar Subramanya, a former Google VP who is now a corporate VP at Microsoft AI, working on the Copilot assistant. The move highlights the intense competition among major tech companies to secure top AI talent as they develop advanced consumer-facing AI products. This trend of aggressive hiring and high-value offers is occurring across the industry, with companies like Meta and Google also making significant investments to attract experts.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that he will meet with Chinese officials in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade discussions. These talks aim to resolve the ongoing economic disputes and could lead to an extension of the current pause on high tariffs. The negotiations follow previous high-level meetings in Geneva and London, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade tensions that saw both nations impose steep levies on each other's exports earlier in the year. Both Washington and Beijing have expressed cautious optimism, noting that recent progress has been made.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:18:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food giants like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet rising consumer demand. This trend is driven by a growing interest in health and wellness, amplified by social media influencers and the use of new weight-loss drugs like GLP-1s. Companies are both launching new protein-fortified items, such as cereals and ice cream, and rebranding existing products to highlight their protein content. While the market is expanding rapidly, companies face the challenge of altering product formulas without compromising taste and alienating their established customer bases.</p>

          <p>At the annual International Mathematical Olympiad, human contestants once again surpassed leading AI models from Google and OpenAI. However, for the first time, the AI programs achieved scores high enough to earn a gold medal, solving five out of six complex problems within the official time limit. This marks a significant advancement from the previous year, demonstrating the rapid improvement in AI's reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. While the top human participants still achieved perfect scores, the progress of AI suggests that machines are quickly catching up in areas once dominated by human intellect.</p>

          <p>Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District have achieved their highest-ever test scores in math and English, fully erasing pandemic-era learning losses. For the second consecutive year, scores rose across all tested grades, with notable gains among Black students and those from low-income families. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho credited targeted initiatives like tutoring and increased instructional time for the success. While these gains are significant, overall proficiency remains a challenge, as a majority of students are still not meeting grade-level standards in math.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. In this prominent role, he will directly challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The shake-up involves several other key changes, including a new party chairman and a new shadow health secretary, after the previous one stepped down due to a health issue. The reshuffle is seen as an effort by Badenoch to renew her party's policy focus and present a unified front.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after pulling his four-year-old child from the jaws of a mountain lion during a family hike in Washington's Olympic National Park. The attack occurred on a popular trail, and the child was airlifted to a trauma center with injuries but has since been discharged. Park officials tracked and euthanized the animal, which was wearing a GPS collar. While harrowing, such attacks are extremely rare in North America, and experts emphasize that mountain lions generally avoid human contact. This incident marks one of only about 20 injurious encounters in Washington state over the past century.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on How Credit Card Payment Grace Periods Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding surrounding credit card grace periods. Most cards offer a grace period on new purchases, which is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the payment due date, during which no interest is charged if the balance is paid in full. However, this protection is typically lost if a balance is carried over from the previous month. For late payments, there is no official, required grace period; fees and penalty APRs can be applied immediately after the due date, though some issuers may offer a brief, informal window.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Harvard University study analyzing over 58,000 women suggests that the sex of children in a family may not be a simple 50/50 probability. Researchers found that after a family has two children of the same sex, the likelihood of the third child also being that same sex increases. For example, in families with three boys, the probability of a fourth boy was 61%. The study indicates that a woman's age at her first birth is a contributing factor, though the exact biological mechanism remains uncertain and may also involve paternal factors.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated content, or "slop," across the internet could inadvertently help cure our collective screen addiction. As social media, search results, and even private messages become saturated with untrustworthy or nonsensical AI output, the real world may become a more appealing alternative. The frustration of discerning human content from bot-generated text could push people toward more offline activities and in-person interactions. While some users may become more deeply enmeshed in AI-mediated online worlds, others may finally find the motivation to "touch grass."</p>

          <p>A new study ranks U.S. states on their preparedness for increasingly intense natural disasters and climate risks, considering factors like renewable energy use, property resilience, and exposure to extreme weather. Nevada was named the most sustainable state, praised for its high percentage of renewable energy, primarily from solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric sources. Other top-ranking states include Colorado, Vermont, and Maine, which have made significant strides in mitigating climate risks despite facing their own environmental challenges. The report highlights the growing importance of sustainability as climate-related disasters become more frequent and costly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel has provided an update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition involving fluid buildup in the brain. The 76-year-old singer, who canceled his tour in May, said the condition is still being treated but that he feels good. He described one of the primary symptoms, a loss of balance, as feeling "like being on a boat." This condition is more common in people over 65 and is often treatable, though the cause is frequently unknown. Joel reassured fans not to worry about his health.</p>

          <p>An expedition surveying the wreckage of the USS DeHaven, a U.S. destroyer sunk during World War II, has discovered remarkably well-preserved artifacts on the ocean floor. Using remotely operated vehicles, explorers captured high-resolution images of the ship's torpedoes and bell, which remain largely intact after more than 80 years. The DeHaven sank in 1943 off the Solomon Islands with 167 crew members on board. This new data provides valuable insights for historians and maritime heritage managers seeking to understand and preserve this significant wartime site.</p>
