          <p>Toyota's global sales for April experienced a 10% increase year-on-year, according to Kyodo News. This growth occurs amidst concerns about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The sales figures indicate continued consumer demand for Toyota vehicles worldwide. The increase may reflect efforts to bolster sales before the tariffs take effect, but the long-term effects of these tariffs on Toyota's profitability and market share remain uncertain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which were unilaterally imposed on numerous countries in April. The court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to levy universal duties on imports without congressional approval. This decision deals a blow to Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations, although the administration has immediately appealed the ruling. Several existing tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel remain unaffected, as they were not justified under IEEPA powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles faces significant challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovering from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential federal funding cuts.

With the Trump administration's policies and ICE operations expanding, more Latinos are becoming U.S. citizens, seeking protection against deportation and promoting civic participation.

Judge Indira Talwani wrote that the administration's termination of legal pathways was likely unlawful and could sow discord across the country.
