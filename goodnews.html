        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 17% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025, with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by growing demand for electric vehicles in China. The company faces challenges including U.S.-China trade tensions and punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move is part of a broader stimulus package to bolster the economy amid ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The rate cuts follow reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders and come as trade-war fears have eased after negotiations with the U.S., leading some investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth this year. However, concerns remain about the housing slump and potential for renewed U.S. tariffs.</p>
