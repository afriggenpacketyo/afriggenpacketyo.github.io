          <p>Five-time Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins has expressed his gratitude to Lance Armstrong, calling him a "great strength and inspiration" in his battle with drug addiction. Wiggins revealed his cocaine addiction in a recent interview, and since his retirement in 2016, Armstrong has provided him with support. He emphasized Armstrong's positive influence on his mental and physical well-being, stating that he is indebted to him. Wiggins also mentioned that he will be working for Armstrong this summer, covering the Tour de France for Armstrong's podcast, The Move.</p>

          <p>Chinese producers, burdened by overcapacity and weak domestic demand, are offering steep discounts on exports, creating a potential "China shock" for the global economy. While this influx of cheap goods could pressure local industries in other countries, it also offers a silver lining by lowering costs for consumers and easing inflationary pressures. Economists suggest this deflationary trend may provide central banks in inflation-worn economies some relief as they balance lowering living costs with reviving growth amidst rising trade tensions. This situation could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth, his literary genius reflecting a life spent wandering between diverse worlds, especially after escaping Germany in the early 1930s. Mann's early works explored the struggles of artists and the decline of bourgeois society, while his later writings confronted the rise of Nazism and the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. He emigrated to the US in 1939 and broadcast radio speeches to Germany, urging resistance against the Nazi regime. With his literature and steadfastness, Mann set a courageous example and a legacy that remains.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has delivered a larger-than-expected 50 basis point cut to its benchmark policy rate, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited softening inflation and slower-than-expected growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. Given the significant rate cut, the RBI indicated limited room for further monetary policy support and shifted its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative" (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>New research from PwC challenges common fears about artificial intelligence, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report analyzes over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are significantly higher. The report suggests that AI enriches automatable jobs by freeing employees for more complex tasks, and can help address workforce gaps in countries with declining working-age populations.</p>

The International Maritime Organisation's push for net-zero emissions has driven investment in decarbonization technologies and new ship orders.
