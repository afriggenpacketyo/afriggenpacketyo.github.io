          <p>Despite national attention on its gun violence, Chicago is experiencing a dramatic downturn in violent crime, with robberies down by a third compared to last year. The city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade, challenging the narrative of it being a "killing field." While violence remains concentrated in specific neighborhoods, tourist areas have generally been safe. The article suggests that while gun crime is decreasing, other forms of street crime, such as theft, may still pose a risk to visitors.</p>

The annual pass allows for unlimited flights for a penny plus taxes and fees, with certain restrictions and blackout dates. This year's pass is valid for 20 months, the longest travel window offered since the program's inception, a move industry experts see as an attempt to capture market share from struggling budget competitors. The pass allows for domestic flight bookings one day before departure and international flights ten days prior.</p>

          <p>A federal district judge has blocked the Trump administration from using military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling states that the deployment of National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits such use of the military. The judge cited President Trump's stated desire to send troops to other cities as support for the injunction. The White House criticized the decision, calling the judge "rogue" and indicating it will likely appeal the ruling, which currently applies only to California.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks several claims surrounding the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup. It addresses the narrative that the trial is a "witch hunt" designed to eliminate him politically, clarifying that he is already barred from running in the next election due to prior convictions. The piece also evaluates allegations of judicial bias, particularly against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, and refutes the claim that Brazil is becoming a dictatorship. The trial is historic, marking the first time a former Brazilian president has faced such charges in a civilian court.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing firm, has agreed to be acquired and taken private by a consortium of investors for $7.4 billion. The group, led by Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, is valuing the company at approximately $28.2 billion including debt. This deal marks a significant consolidation in the aircraft leasing industry, which has seen record rental rates due to a shortage of new planes. The acquisition reflects a broader trend of consolidation as companies seek to increase scale in a market where lessors now own more than half of the world's passenger jets.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Differences Between Debt Consolidation Loans and Programs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 15:12:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the distinction between two common strategies for managing debt: debt consolidation loans and debt consolidation programs. A debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new loan, typically with a lower interest rate, to pay off multiple existing debts, simplifying payments into a single monthly bill. In contrast, a debt consolidation program is a service offered by a debt relief company that helps a consumer obtain such a loan and manages the repayment process. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, with direct loans often being better for those with good credit. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For taxpayers facing a significant debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), several resolution options are available to avoid severe consequences like liens or wage garnishment. These methods include negotiating an Offer in Compromise to settle for less than the full amount, setting up an installment agreement for monthly payments, or requesting a temporary delay in collection due to financial hardship. Taxpayers can also seek penalty abatement for reasonable cause or work with tax debt relief services to navigate the process.

          <p>This article outlines the options for individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, clarifying that while there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs, relief is possible. The primary methods discussed are debt settlement programs, where a company negotiates with creditors to reduce the principal balance in exchange for a lump-sum payment, and bankruptcy, which can potentially eliminate the debt entirely. Both options can have significant negative impacts on a person's credit score. The article also suggests alternatives like debt consolidation loans and financial hardship programs offered directly by credit card companies as less damaging solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should avoid several key mistakes this month. Financial experts advise against shopping around for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their rates, making it crucial to lock in a high rate quickly. Savers should also actively monitor the rate climate and avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity, as the new rates will likely be lower. Instead, they should have a plan to reinvest or transfer the funds to maximize their returns in a changing interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details three ways retirees could potentially lose or see a reduction in their Social Security benefits. The first is by working while claiming benefits before reaching full retirement age, which can trigger temporary reductions if earnings exceed a certain limit. Second, benefits can be garnished to pay for federal debts like taxes or student loans, and up to 85% of benefits can be subject to income tax depending on one's total income. Finally, changes in eligibility, such as a divorced spouse remarrying before age 60, can also impact the amount received.</p>

The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, would require the release of the documents within 30 days. The move seeks to bypass House leadership, which has scheduled a vote on a different bill directing the Oversight Committee to continue its investigation, a measure Massie criticized as a tactic to provide political cover for members who oppose the release.</p>

Trump sought to remove Cook for "cause" based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which the economists argue is a politically motivated move to influence monetary policy.
