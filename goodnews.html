          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2.

The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France. Sir David Attenborough has also voiced concerns about the destructive impact of bottom trawling.</p>
