          <p>As of July 11, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,357.20 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability and inflation. Multiple factors influence its price, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, interest rates have an inverse relationship with gold's appeal, while the strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining its market value.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 09:36:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally is also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and concerns about the increasing federal deficit, which can make alternative assets like bitcoin more attractive. The significant price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further propelling the cryptocurrency's value as investors anticipate continued corporate adoption and potential crypto-friendly legislation.

          <h2>Levi Strauss Raises Sales Forecast Despite Uncertainty from Potential Tariff Increases</h2>

          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling confidence in consumer demand despite facing potential cost increases from U.S. trade tariffs. The denim company, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results, now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2% for the year. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the company is currently absorbing some tariff-related costs, aided by strong sales momentum and a strategy of reducing promotions. The positive outlook comes as Levi's makes successful inroads in its direct-to-consumer channels and expands its apparel offerings for women. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting new national priority vouchers, which can significantly speed up the approval process for certain treatments. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary stated that this change aligns with the Trump administration's goal of lowering prescription drug prices for Americans. The voucher program aims to incentivize development in areas of national interest, such as cures for Type 1 diabetes and stage 4 cancer. While the move is intended to address high drug costs, questions remain about how affordability will be assessed before a drug's launch and the potential risks of accelerated reviews.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. continues to threaten trade partners with tariffs, analysts recommend that China adopt a pragmatic, long-term strategy to counter Washington's protectionism. This approach involves strengthening ties and offering tangible benefits, such as greater market access, to its own regional trade partners to build a more unified economic bloc. Rather than relying solely on strong rhetoric, Beijing is being advised to focus on fostering development opportunities and regional integration. This strategic shift aims to fortify China's position and create a collective pushback against what some perceive as aggressive U.S. trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a notable shift, the Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) is urging state-owned enterprises to research the potential use of stablecoins and other digital assets. The regulator called on these firms to study how blockchain technology could be applied in cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This directive is significant given China's long-standing ban on most cryptocurrency-related activities. The move aligns with recent suggestions from state-owned media that Beijing should proactively consider regulating stablecoins and their potential role in globalizing the yuan.
