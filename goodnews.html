        </div>

          <p>Despite the stock market reaching all-time highs, some financial experts observe a declining appeal in passive investment strategies centered on S&P 500 index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). The primary concern is a lack of diversification, as the technology sector now constitutes a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. Consequently, investors are increasingly looking towards small-cap stocks for broader market exposure. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, recently hit an all-time high, outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French energy giant TotalEnergies has announced its decision to lift the "force majeure" and restart its $20 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. The massive energy infrastructure project, Africa's largest private investment, was suspended in 2021 following a deadly jihadist attack on the site. The move signals a significant step toward stabilizing the region and unlocking Mozambique's vast natural gas reserves. However, the restart is contingent on final approval from the Mozambican government, and security concerns in the region persist despite the absence of major attacks on the project site.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU is actively working to end its dependency on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing, including electric vehicles and military equipment. The announcement follows Beijing's recent imposition of export controls on these materials, a move seen as leveraging its dominant market position amid global trade disputes. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, boosting domestic production and processing, and significantly increasing recycling efforts to create a more resilient and independent supply chain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is demonstrating a remarkable and speedy recovery, inspiring river restoration efforts worldwide. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water quality has improved, and diverse wildlife is returning to the ecosystem. To mark the milestone, a group of 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the river's full length in more than 100 years. This journey, organized by Ríos to Rivers, not only reconnected the youth with their heritage but also brought global attention to the success of Indigenous-led environmental restoration.</p>

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, the Octagon House holds a unique place in American history as one of Washington D.C.'s oldest residences. After the British burned the White House in 1814, President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison used the Octagon as their temporary home for six months. It was here that President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, officially ending the War of 1812. The building, now a museum, is also known for its reported paranormal activity, with stories of unexplained events and ghostly presences, including a possible encounter by a young Jackie Bouvier before she became First Lady.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While official vote counting is still in progress, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker. Known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, Connolly garnered support from a coalition of left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who has served the maximum two seven-year terms, and will become the third woman to hold the largely ceremonial but constitutionally important role.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic robot that closely mimics a jellyfish, designed for stealthy underwater operations. Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material, operates nearly silently, and has low power consumption. Its lifelike appearance and quiet propulsion make it ideal for tasks such as covert monitoring, inspecting underwater structures, and observing fragile marine ecosystems without causing disruption. The compact device measures just 120mm in diameter and weighs only 56 grams, showcasing advancements in biomimetic robotics for surveillance and scientific research.</p>

Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as the candidate closer to the party leadership, is viewed by some as an expression of unease within the party regarding its current direction and recent political challenges. While not a landslide, the win places Powell in a senior, directly elected role. Following the result, she met with Starmer, and has indicated that she intends to voice her critiques privately.</p>
