          <p>Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, admitted that former President Joe Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term, despite Khanna's previous defense of Biden's mental and physical fitness. Khanna emphasized that he doesn't believe there was a cover-up regarding Biden's condition but feels Biden's advisors owe the public an explanation. He highlighted Biden's accomplishments, such as the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, while still maintaining that seeking re-election was the wrong decision. Khanna also discussed his focus on regaining the House and promoting a working-class economic agenda, referring to it as "economic patriotism."</p>

          <p>British mountain guide Kenton Cool scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time on Sunday, breaking his own record for the most ascents of the world's highest mountain by a non-Sherpa guide. The 51-year-old from southwest England reached the 29,032-foot peak along with other climbers, according to Himalayan Guides Nepal. Cool first climbed Everest in 2004 and has done so almost every year since, with exceptions in 2014, 2015, and 2020 due to various circumstances. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have scaled the peak more times than Cool, with Kami Rita holding the record at 30 ascents.</p>

          <p>A sketch from Saturday Night Live's season finale featured two couples at a bar, with one couple (Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny) speaking Spanish. The humor arises from the other characters' and the audience's misunderstanding of the Spanish dialogue, leading to comedic interpretations of the couples' relationship dynamics. The sketch highlights the gap between what non-Spanish speakers assume about macho Latino stereotypes and what the men are actually saying, which is a heart-to-heart about their troubled relationships. The sketch also underscores the limitations of subtitles in conveying the nuances of language and cultural context.</p>

          <p>Hawaii is renowned for lei-making, an ancient tradition introduced by early Polynesian settlers. Meleana Estes, a Hawaiian native, learned the art of lei-making from her grandmother and emphasizes that a lei is an "expression of aloha". However, the future of lei making is in peril due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the decline of local flower farms. Andrew Mau, who owns a boutique called ISLAND-BOY, adapts by using alternative materials like wood beads and unripe fruit. Despite the challenges, lei making remains a cherished tradition in Hawaii.</p>
