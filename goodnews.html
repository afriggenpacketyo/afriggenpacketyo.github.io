          <p>Nigerian international footballer Ashleigh Plumptre has opened up about her decision to move from the English Women's Super League to Saudi Arabia's Al-Ittihad, a move that generated significant controversy. She admits her initial reaction to the offer was negative but was won over by the project's vision. Plumptre acknowledges that her decision deeply hurt some of her LGBTQ+ fans, given Saudi Arabia's laws against same-sex relations, and expresses regret for losing their trust. While acknowledging the Saudi women's league still has a long way to go, she also aims to challenge Western preconceptions about the country, stating she feels safer there than in the UK.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has revised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China upward to 4.8%, a notable increase from its previous 4% prediction. This adjustment comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States and reflects the impact of government stimulus measures. However, the report also notes potential headwinds, such as a persistent real estate slump, sluggish consumer spending, and the likelihood that government support may fade. The World Bank projects China's growth will slow to 4.2% in 2026 as export momentum wanes and Beijing moderates its stimulus efforts to manage public debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese automotive giant BYD has announced that the United Kingdom is now its largest market outside of China, following an extraordinary 880% year-over-year sales increase in September. The company sold over 11,000 cars in the UK last month, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model. This success is partly attributed to the UK not imposing the high tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that are in place in the EU and the US. While overall EV sales are rising in Britain, vehicles powered by petrol and diesel still constitute the majority of new car purchases.</p>

          <p>Manchester City and England defender John Stones has revealed that he contemplated retiring from football last season due to a series of frustrating injuries. The 31-year-old struggled with foot and hamstring issues that limited him to just 11 league appearances and ended his season prematurely in February. Stones described the mental toll of repeatedly breaking down despite his professional efforts to stay fit, admitting he was in a "very difficult place." Although he now says he would not have gone through with it, the admission highlights the severe mental and physical challenges faced by elite athletes dealing with chronic injury problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, pine martens are once again present in Exmoor National Park following a successful reintroduction effort by conservationists. Nineteen of the cat-sized native mammals were carefully transported from Scotland and released at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal has been fitted with a radio collar, allowing researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to their new environment. The project is being hailed as a positive step for ecological restoration, as pine martens play a crucial role in balancing woodland ecosystems. Their return is seen as a hopeful sign that nature can be restored.</p>

          <p>Chinese transport authorities are managing a massive travel surge as millions of people return home at the end of the national "golden week" holiday period. A significant increase in traffic was anticipated, particularly in the country's four largest megacity clusters, including the regions around Beijing and Shanghai. The Ministry of Public Security reported that as of Monday night, there were no major accidents or large-scale congestion. Authorities have been coordinating efforts to ensure smooth and safe travel, with special attention given to areas recently affected by extreme weather to prevent any potential incidents.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its crude oil storage capacity as part of a strategic initiative to increase its national stockpiles, a campaign that has gained urgency since global energy flows were disrupted. State-owned companies are set to add at least 169 million barrels of storage across eleven new sites by 2026, which will significantly boost the nation's ability to withstand supply shocks. This reserve-building effort, driven by geopolitical risks and China's heavy reliance on foreign oil, is also absorbing surplus global supply and providing support for oil prices. The move is a key component of Beijing's broader strategy to ensure its energy security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in their playoff series, thanks to a decisive four-run rally in the seventh inning. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 batters in a row, the Dodgers' offense came alive. The inning was sparked by smart baserunning from Freddie Freeman and culminated in key two-out RBI singles from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani. The win gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series as it moves to Los Angeles for Game 3.</p>

The victory snapped an eight-game losing streak for the Jaguars against the Chiefs, dating back to 2009. Lawrence accounted for three total touchdowns in the game, overcoming two turnovers to lead his team on the game-winning drive in the final moments of the contest.</p>

          <p>The European Union has weighed in on the escalating dispute over United Nations Resolution 2758, stating that the 1971 document does not mention Taiwan. The EU spokesperson clarified that the resolution's purpose was solely to switch China's representation at the UN from the government in Taipei to the one in Beijing. This statement supports the position of Taiwan and the United States, which accuse China of misinterpreting the resolution to bolster its sovereignty claims over the island. The EU's comment underscores the growing international pushback against Beijing's narrative that the resolution provides a legal basis for its territorial ambitions regarding Taiwan.</p>

          <p>The city of Atlanta has passed a new law requiring all new and replacement roofs to be more reflective, a strategy known as "cool roofs," to combat the effects of urban heat. This initiative is projected to cool the city by an average of 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit and save residents and businesses an estimated $315 million in energy bills over 35 years. The legislation aims to mitigate the "heat island" effect, where dense concentrations of concrete and asphalt trap heat, posing health risks, especially to vulnerable populations. Atlanta's comprehensive approach is being praised as a cost-effective measure to build resilience and advance climate justice.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law requiring streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to regulate the volume of their commercials. The legislation extends existing federal rules for broadcast and cable television to the streaming industry, mandating that advertisements cannot be significantly louder than the programs they interrupt. The bill was inspired by complaints about sudden, loud commercials disrupting households, particularly those with young children. Because many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state law is expected to set a de facto national standard, potentially leading to quieter ad breaks for viewers across the country.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a new record high for the second day in a row, driven by a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street.

Japanese chip-related companies like Advantest and Tokyo Electron were among the top performers, pushing the index to its fresh peak. The market gains also followed the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling party, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister.
