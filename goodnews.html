          <p>Experts are advocating for increased vision screening in schools to detect lazy eyes (amblyopia) early, as many children are being missed for treatment in areas without school-based screenings. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) is calling for universal screening in England, similar to Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, typically patching, are most effective before the age of seven. The Local Government Association (LGA) is requesting increased funding to support school-based screening programs.</p>
