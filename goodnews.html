          <p>Europe is witnessing a significant increase in Chinese tourists, with a 13% year-on-year rise in the first half of 2025. This trend is expected to continue, as a recent European Travel Commission report found that 72% of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent, a much higher rate than other key markets like the US and Japan. The influx of visitors is noticeable across major European cities, with industry experts expressing optimism about the sustained momentum. This surge provides a welcome boost to Europe's tourism sector as it recovers and grows.</p>

          <p>Astronaut Jim Lovell, renowned for his leadership in safely guiding the crippled Apollo 13 mission back to Earth in 1970, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell became a symbol of resilience after an onboard explosion aborted a lunar landing, turning a potential catastrophe into what NASA called a "successful failure." He was the first person to fly to the Moon twice, on Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, though he never landed on its surface. His family and figures like Tom Hanks, who portrayed him in the film "Apollo 13," remembered his unshakeable optimism and pioneering spirit.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has ended his attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby union. While a recent back injury and a coaching staff change were factors, his decision was also influenced by increasing opportunities back in rugby, including a potential spot on the Wales national team. Experts are divided on his NFL prospects, with some noting his speed was not exceptional by NFL standards and that he faced a steep learning curve. Despite the premature end to his American dream, analysts believe the experience has matured him and added new skills he can apply back on the rugby field.</p>

Wing Abby Dow described the team's journey as a step-by-step climb toward the final, emphasizing the need for perfect timing and execution. Their next major test is a match against France, a team they narrowly defeated in the recent Six Nations tournament. Coach John Mitchell is prioritizing performance over their 26-match winning streak, viewing the tough upcoming fixtures as crucial for building resilience.</p>

The game's pivotal moment came when Mookie Betts hit a two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The contest was a nostalgic duel between two of the sport's most decorated pitchers, who have a combined 436 wins and will one day be in the Hall of Fame.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is unlikely to derail a potential EU-India free trade agreement. Experts suggest that the larger pressure on New Delhi comes from the United States, where the threat of high tariffs on Indian goods could be a greater economic challenge. This situation may paradoxically benefit the EU, as India could be more motivated to diversify its trade relationships and finalize a deal with a more predictable partner. An agreement with the EU could offer India economic stability while navigating a volatile global landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a pure, macroscopic hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough for a material first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967. This rare form of diamond, known as lonsdaleite, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to be even harder. Previous attempts by researchers globally had only produced impure or mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's achievement, detailed in the journal Nature, provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens possibilities for creating new, ultra-hard materials.</p>

An algorithm matches attendees into small groups based on interests and personality traits to facilitate more meaningful connections. The concept is tapping into a growing trend of people seeking real-life interactions, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps.</p>

The discovery, made during a test for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. The 41-year-old star said the news prompted a deeper reflection on his life's purpose and motivations, shifting his focus toward living better and maximizing quality time with his family.

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on everything from small 'pick-me-ups' like lipstick to major experiences like concert tickets to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," sees consumers cutting back on daily essentials while still splurging on items and events that bring joy. Analysts note that a post-pandemic re-evaluation of well-being and the unattainability of traditional milestones like homeownership for younger generations are fueling the trend. This behavior is expected to persist as global economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>
