          <p>Jessica Grose's article in the New York Times examines the hyperfeminine and overtly Christian aesthetic adopted by some Republican women in politics, such as Nancy Mace and Kristi Noem, contrasting it with their often aggressive rhetoric and behavior on social media. The article suggests that this look is a calculated strategy to go viral and exert a form of female power acceptable within conservative communities, although it does not necessarily translate to enduring political influence. It also explores how algorithms reward homogeneity and rage baiting, influencing the content and style of these politicians. Ultimately, the article questions the long-term effectiveness and desirability of such tactics in political discourse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to immediately resettle 12,000 refugees into the U.S., partially blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at halting the refugee admissions program. The judge, Jamal Whitehead, issued the order despite the administration's argument that it should only have to process 160 refugees. Whitehead stated that the administration cannot disobey statutory and constitutional law while seeking clarification. The order requires the administration to resume processing cases of refugees protected by the court order and facilitate their admission into the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Moderna's Combination Flu and COVID-19 Shot Shows Promise in Older Adults</h2>

          <p>A Moderna study reveals that a combination flu and COVID-19 shot generated a strong immune response in older adults. The messenger RNA vaccine generated antibodies against COVID-19 and most flu strains, but regulators seek data on protection from illness. The mRNA technology, used in approved COVID-19 and RSV shots, could expedite flu shot production. This development offers potential benefits such as improved vaccination rates, but challenges remain in timing the shots and confirming long-term protection.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have largely shrugged off recent tensions with Pakistan following India's military strikes, demonstrating investor confidence in India's growth prospects and strong macro fundamentals. Structural reforms, resilient domestic demand, and progress on trade talks with major partners, including a potential trade deal with the U.S., are supporting market sentiment. While investors anticipate some short-term volatility, they remain hopeful for a swift de-escalation and limited fallout.</p>
