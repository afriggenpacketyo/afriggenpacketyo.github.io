          <p>Lauren Sánchez Bezos was recently seen in Saint-Tropez wearing a sheer, leopard-print dress during a night out with her husband, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The couple, who married in June, have been celebrating their nuptials in Europe, accompanied by numerous high-profile guests. Sánchez has been noted for her fashion choices, including the more conservative Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress she wore, which she said was inspired by a Sophia Loren film. The couple's relationship became public in 2019, and they were engaged in May 2023.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are 'underspending' on artificial intelligence, despite projections of a combined $320 billion investment in 2025. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a 'winner-take-all' situation, and increased spending is necessary to secure a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification, Cramer believes these investments are crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI systems, which could lead to a near-monopoly for the ultimate winner.

          <h2>Analysis of 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' Post-Credits Scene Reveals Major MCU Villain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 19:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new Marvel film 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' features a mid-credits scene that formally introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the scene, a cloaked figure with a distinctive mask appears before Reed Richards and Sue Storm's son, Franklin. This sets the stage for the upcoming crossover film 'Avengers: Doomsday,' where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character. The film is set in an alternate universe, Earth-828, suggesting the Fantastic Four's eventual arrival in the main MCU timeline may be driven by this new threat.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Mexico's environmental ministry have signed a memorandum of understanding committing to a permanent solution for the severe pollution in the Tijuana River. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that President Trump was motivated to act after hearing from Navy SEALs who train in the contaminated ocean waters. The agreement includes Mexico releasing $93 million in previously committed funds and accelerating infrastructure improvements to redirect wastewater. While environmental groups praised the move as a 'massive step forward,' some local officials remain skeptical about its full implementation and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, currently in the third year of his modest rookie contract, is positioned for a significant payday. After establishing himself as a breakout star, he will be eligible for a contract extension in the upcoming offseason, potentially valued at over $100 million. His on-field success and the recent lucrative extensions signed by other young receivers, like Garrett Wilson, have set a high market precedent. Nacua, who will earn just over $1 million this season, is focused on improving his game while playing alongside newly acquired star Davante Adams.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages in 500 U.S. restaurants, inspired by its recently closed CosMc's drink-focused chain. The move aims to attract younger customers, particularly Gen Z, who show a strong preference for flavorful and unique cold drinks. The new offerings, which include items like a Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and a Popping Tropic Refresher, will be branded with the CosMc's name. This strategy allows McDonald's to integrate the experimental beverage concepts into its existing stores rather than operating separate locations, capitalizing on a growing market for specialty drinks.</p>

          <p>China is constructing a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Medog county, a remote area of Tibet located near the disputed border with India. The project is a cornerstone of Beijing's strategy to develop the region, generate significant energy, and enhance its border security. The location in the Himalayan foothills is both geographically challenging and geopolitically significant due to its proximity to contested territory. This article provides context on the dam's location and its strategic importance for China's regional and national objectives, highlighting the intersection of infrastructure, energy, and security policy.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a critical component for developing ultra-high-power laser weapons. This synthetic crystal, measuring 60 millimeters in diameter, can efficiently convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere. More importantly, it can withstand immense power levels, potentially solving the long-standing problem of laser components damaging themselves during operation. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based lasers powerful enough to disable satellites in orbit, marking a significant advance in directed-energy weapon technology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, maintains the ability of individual voters and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The action came in a case from North Dakota, where tribes challenged a redistricting plan for diluting Native American voting strength. The Court blocked a lower appellate court ruling that had uniquely argued individuals do not have a private right to sue under the act. This temporary victory for voting rights advocates may be short-lived, as the justices are set to rehear a separate, similar case from Louisiana next term.</p>
