          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar to use as Air Force One, according to sources familiar with the planning. The administration plans to retrofit the plane for official presidential use and transfer it to Trump's presidential library foundation at the end of his term. This move comes as the modernization of two existing Boeing 747s has faced delays and cost overruns.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war between the US and China following high-level talks in Geneva. This meeting, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs in January, saw Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng engaged in closed-door discussions. While details remain undisclosed until Monday, Trump praised the talks for engendering a "total reset" in the relationship.

          <p>Nottingham Forest's manager Nuno Espirito Santo stated that his side's bid to qualify for the Champions League is "not finished" despite a damaging home draw against already-relegated Leicester. The team remains seventh, trailing behind Chelsea and Aston Villa, as the results of the weekend games mean that only four points separate Newcastle in third and Forest in seventh with two rounds of fixtures remaining. Chelsea's chances were also dented as they were beaten 2-0 at Newcastle. The article also indicates that the Forest's match against Chelsea on the last day of the season increasingly looks like it could determine which of the two sides finishes in the top five.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess indefinitely due to concerns that the game is a source of gambling, with officials saying the game has been prohibited until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. This action follows the Taliban's broader restrictions on sports, particularly for women, as they steadily impose laws reflecting their strict interpretation of Islamic law. One cafe owner in Kabul, who has hosted chess competitions, expressed respect for the decision but noted it would negatively impact his business, as chess provided a popular activity for young people.</p>
