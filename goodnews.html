          <h2>Federal Judge Mandates Continued Medicaid Funding for Planned Parenthood Clinics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:02:51 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide, delivering a significant legal victory for the organization. The ruling blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to defund affiliates providing abortions by cutting off their Medicaid payments for one year. Judge Indira Talwani's order noted that restricting these funds would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that without this funding, nearly 200 of its clinics would be at risk of closure.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently seen a slight decrease, presenting a more affordable borrowing opportunity for homeowners. With the average HELOC rate now at 8.26% and home equity loan rates at 8.25%, experts advise homeowners to act strategically. Homeowners should carefully compare the two products to see which fits their needs, check with their current mortgage lender for offers before shopping around, and precisely determine the amount of equity they need to borrow. This cautious approach is recommended since the home serves as collateral for these types of loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matty Healy, frontman of The 1975, is championing a new festival called The Seed Sounds Weekender to support the small pubs and bars where many artists begin their careers. Healy warned that without these "seed" venues, the pipeline for new talent could dry up, preventing future iconic acts from emerging. The festival, organized by GigPig, will involve over 1,000 venues across the UK and aims to highlight their cultural importance amid unprecedented economic challenges facing the hospitality sector. The event is a response to the ongoing closure of pubs and grassroots spaces that are vital for emerging artists.</p>

          <p>The city of Philadelphia has officially renamed a portion of South Broad Street as "Teddy Pendergrass Way" to honor the iconic R&B singer. The ceremony celebrated the life and legacy of the Philadelphia native, who was the lead singer of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes before a successful solo career. The location is significant, as it is near the former Philadelphia International Records studio where Pendergrass recorded many of his hits. Mayor Cherelle Parker also presented the Pendergrass family with a replica of the Liberty Bell, the city's highest honor for a citizen's family.</p>

          <h2>Nutrition Experts Suggest Alternative Iron-Rich Foods for Those Reducing Red Meat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 12:47:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals cutting back on red meat due to health concerns like increased risks of diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts recommend several alternative sources of iron. Plant-based options rich in this vital mineral include lentils, beans, tofu, pumpkin seeds, and spinach. To enhance the body's absorption of this plant-based iron, it is best to pair these foods with sources of vitamin C. Additionally, certain types of seafood such as oysters, clams, and sardines are excellent sources of iron. Fortified breads and cereals also contribute significantly to daily iron intake in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Amid a significant shortage of federal firefighters, Cal Fire has opened a new state-of-the-art training center in Merced County to bolster its workforce. The Atwater Training Center is the fourth such facility in the state and will help train approximately 1,600 firefighters in 2025, from entry-level recruits to company officers. This expansion is part of California's multiyear effort to combat increasingly severe wildfires, which has included nearly doubling its fire protection budget since 2017. The move comes as the U.S. Forest Service reports that about 27% of its federal firefighting positions remain vacant.</p>

According to the TSA, 99% of PreCheck passengers wait less than 10 minutes, a significant time-saver compared to standard lines.
