          <p>A significant Saharan dust plume is traversing the Atlantic Ocean and is anticipated to affect Florida and South Texas. Radar forecasts indicate the dust will arrive in South and Central Florida by Saturday, potentially lingering for several days, with a denser plume expected by mid-next week. The National Weather Service in San Juan reported reduced visibility and hazy skies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to the dust, and the National Hurricane Center noted that the dry air associated with the dust suppresses storm development. This annual phenomenon, known as the Saharan Air Layer, typically peaks in June and August, with dust outbreaks occurring every few days and impacting allergies and causing eye irritation.</p>

Commissioner Robert Manfred announced the collaboration, which includes broadcasting select games on MLB Network and MLB.TV, along with marketing and financial support. The AUSL's inaugural season launches on June 7, featuring four teams playing a 24-game season across 12 cities, culminating in a championship series from July 26-28.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston indicated plans to issue a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's move to revoke Harvard University's certification to host foreign students. Judge Allison D. Burroughs had previously granted Harvard a temporary restraining order, preventing the government from revoking the school's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Harvard's lawsuit argues that the revocation would affect over 7,000 visa holders, comprising more than a quarter of its student body. This legal challenge highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and higher education institutions regarding international student policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has partially reversed its decision to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, granting the school 30 days to challenge the administration's initial action. The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a letter formally notifying Harvard of the potential withdrawal of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, but allowing the university a window to demonstrate compliance. Despite this change, a U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Harvard's international students, citing concerns about the administration's motives and Harvard's First Amendment rights.</p>

Cramer noted that GE Vernova shares dropped more than 3% after eight consecutive sessions of gains, offering a chance for investors to initiate a position.

China had previously paused deliveries, but has now indicated they will resume, which is a positive sign for Boeing's international operations. Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, contributes significantly to reducing the U.S. trade deficit through its airplane production.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), located in New York City, is a federal court specializing in international trade issues, resolving disputes between governments, manufacturers, and trade associations. It struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, deeming them beyond his legal authority. Three judges, including appointees from different administrations, ruled against the tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. The CIT serves as a crucial forum for interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, helping to avoid jurisdictional conflicts among other federal courts.</p>

This object, roughly 430 miles across, is three times smaller than Pluto and orbits the sun every 25,000 years, venturing into the Oort cloud. The discovery challenges the Planet Nine theory, as its orbit does not follow the clustered trend of other icy rocks in the Kuiper Belt.

The unanimous decision favored the developers of a proposed 88-mile railroad in Utah, which would transport crude oil to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh stated that procedural law has given judges and environmentalists too much authority to hinder development, leading to fewer and more expensive infrastructure projects.
