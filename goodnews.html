          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The company also reported strong net bookings, a key indicator of future demand, driven by the needs of the artificial intelligence sector. However, ASML expressed caution about its future outlook, narrowing its 2025 sales growth forecast and stating it could not confirm growth for 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. This reflects the broader challenges facing the semiconductor industry, including the impact of U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League 7-6 in the 95th MLB All-Star Game, with the outcome decided by the first-ever home run swing-off. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber of the Philadelphia Phillies hit three home runs on three swings to clinch a 4-3 victory in the tiebreaker. The exciting new format, which energized players and fans, required a coach to pitch, with Dodgers' third base coach Dino Ebel throwing to the NL hitters. Schwarber's clutch performance earned him the All-Star Game MVP award, capping a dramatic finish to the event.</p>

          <p>China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, are forecast to hit a record 16 to 17 million metric tons this year. Analysts attribute the surge to the startup of new petrochemical plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane, supplies of which have been disrupted by trade tensions. This increased demand from China is expected to provide significant support for Asian refiners' profit margins for the feedstock. The move highlights how geopolitical trade conflicts are reshaping global energy and chemical supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>
