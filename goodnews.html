          <p>Following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese representatives have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus, which aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries after recent trade tensions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement addresses Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions to China, contingent on approvals from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping. This framework signifies a commitment to de-escalation, though the specifics and potential for breakthroughs remain uncertain, and both sides will brief their respective leaders on the details of the agreement. This development signals a move towards resolving trade disputes and fostering bilateral trust between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chris Newman, the lawyer representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, argues that his client's case extends beyond immigration issues, highlighting it as a crucial moment for due process rights in the U.S. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador, where he was held in a supermax prison, despite a previous court ruling against his deportation. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and denying Abrego Garcia due process, while the administration asserts compliance with court orders. Democratic lawmakers who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador conveyed a warning about the erosion of democratic institutions, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding constitutional protections. The legal proceedings aim to ensure Abrego Garcia has the opportunity to defend himself in court against the charges of human smuggling.</p>

Tesla has been testing driverless vehicles in Austin without human safety supervisors, and the service will be "geofenced" and remotely monitored by employees to ensure safety. The Dawn Project and other activist groups are planning protests to highlight safety concerns with Tesla's driver assistance features and to express opposition to Musk's political activities. Musk's other ventures include SpaceX and xAI, and he recently concluded a period leading the Department of Government Efficiency, where he implemented significant cuts to federal agencies.</p>

          <p>An accidental discovery during the preproduction of a planetarium show may shift scientists‚Äô understanding of the Oort Cloud, a distant region of icy bodies surrounding the sun. A spiral structure was revealed within the Oort Cloud during a test projection, prompting further investigation and a scientific paper confirming its presence. The spiral is attributed to the galactic tide, the gravitational field of the Milky Way, which affects the orbital planes of objects in the Oort Cloud. This finding challenges the widely held belief that the Oort Cloud is spherical, and it offers new insights into the dynamics of our solar system.</p>
