          <h2>FDA Considers Removing Ingestible Fluoride Products for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 10:22:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is initiating a scientific review aimed at potentially removing prescription ingestible fluoride products for children from the market by October 31. Citing concerns about the impact of ingested fluoride on the gut microbiome and possible links to thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move. Dental experts, however, largely disagree, pointing to decades of data showing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing cavities. The FDA's decision has sparked debate about balancing potential risks and benefits, especially for low-income children lacking access to fluoridated water and dental care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-rich individuals, are facing a growing challenge in recruiting and retaining qualified money managers. With the number of family offices expected to increase significantly by 2030, the demand for skilled advisors is outpacing the supply. Trust is a critical factor for family offices, often leading them to prioritize long-term relationships over expertise. This selectivity, combined with competition from banks and private equity firms, makes it difficult to find candidates willing to work in the relatively informal and potentially risky environment of a family office.
