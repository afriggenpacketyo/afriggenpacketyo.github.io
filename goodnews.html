          <p>The South Texas community near Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility has officially voted to become the city of Starbase, fulfilling Musk's ambition to create a company town. The vote tally was overwhelmingly in favor, with 212 votes for and 6 against, indicating strong support from the local residents, many of whom are SpaceX employees. Concerns have been raised about Musk's increased control over the area, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park during launches, as well as efforts to shift authority from the county to the new town's government. SpaceX aims to increase the number of South Texas launches from 5 to 25 per year, necessitating streamlined operations and beach closures for safety.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of common-law couples avoid legal marriage due to the country's law requiring married couples to share a surname. The rate is even higher among people in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing the surname issue as a deterrent. Advocates for separate surnames argue that the current law restricts individual choice and creates disadvantages for common-law couples regarding tax deductions and inheritance rights. The survey estimates that over one million people are in common-law relationships, with a significant portion desiring legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted.</p>

          <p>The article recounts the story of Catina Salarno, a college freshman murdered in 1979 by her former boyfriend, and the subsequent decades-long fight by her family to keep him in prison. The Salarno family's activism led to significant changes in California's victims' rights laws, including allowing victims to give impact statements and ensuring support for child witnesses. The article details the family's personal struggles, the trial of Steven Burns, and their continued presence at parole hearings to advocate against his release. Despite Burns's continued incarceration, the Salarno family remains dedicated to supporting other victims and fighting for justice within the legal system.</p>
