        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish governments have agreed on a new framework to address legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles. This deal involves reforming the UK's controversial legacy body, establishing a new police legacy unit in Ireland, and creating a support fund for victims. The agreement aims to resolve a diplomatic dispute caused by the UK's previous Legacy Act, which was widely opposed. New legislation will be required in both countries to implement these changes, which are seen as an opportunity to provide truth and justice for families affected by the conflict.</p>

          <p>Italian driver Fabio Barone has set a new world record for the fastest speed achieved by a car on a boat. He drove a Ferrari SF90 across the flight deck of an Italian navy aircraft carrier, reaching a certified speed of 101.9 mph (164 km/h). The attempt, which took place near Rome, successfully broke his previous record of 94.4 mph set last year. The team had to overcome challenges, including a wet flight deck, before Barone successfully completed the high-speed run and stopped safely before the end of the deck. The result will now be submitted to Guinness World Records for official recognition.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index reversed earlier gains and closed lower after the Bank of Japan announced it would maintain its policy rate at 0.5%. This decision was widely expected and comes as Japan's core inflation rate for August fell to 2.7%, its lowest point since November 2024. Despite the rate hold, the Japanese yen appreciated against the dollar, and yields on 2-year government bonds rose to their highest since 2008. Analysts suggest the central bank is taking a cautious approach, prioritizing stability amid slowing inflation and global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is responsible for policing borders, while the military's primary focus is national defense. The comments were a response to Trump's suggestion, made during his state visit, that military force could be a deterrent for illegal migration. The UK government affirmed its commitment to its current strategy, including a new returns agreement with France, to manage the crossings.</p>

          <p>The new iPhone 17 went on sale worldwide, drawing crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The launch is a critical moment for Apple as it faces intensified competition, particularly in China from local brands like Huawei, and investor questions about its artificial intelligence strategy. Initial reports from retailers suggest strong preorder demand, especially in China, which could help Apple regain lost market share in the key region. Consumers expressed excitement over new features like improved design and longer battery life, indicating continued loyalty to the Apple ecosystem despite broader market pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 0.5%, a move that was anticipated by economists. The decision follows the release of data showing that Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest level since November 2024. While headline inflation remains above the bank's 2% target, the central bank appears to be taking a cautious stance, prioritizing economic stability amid global uncertainties. Analysts note that this strategy supports Japan's reflationary cycle, contrasting with rate cuts in the U.S. and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Listed companies based in China's Xinjiang region saw their stock prices surge, outperforming the broader market, driven by the area's strong economic performance. Xinjiang's economy grew by 5.7% in the first half of the year, surpassing the national average of 5.2%. Investor optimism is fueled by expectations of continued policy support from Beijing for the resource-rich region. Speculation about the potential development of an artificial intelligence data center in Xinjiang, leveraging its vast land and low power costs, also contributed to the rally in stocks like Xinjiang Communications Construction Group.

This total includes recent arrivals, long-term residents, and over 1.2 million refugees from Ukraine.

Coming from a rugby family where both parents captained Canada, she has overcome a significant knee injury to return to world-class form. Despite being an amateur side, Canada is ranked second in the world and sees this match as a pivotal moment to inspire the growth of rugby back home.</p>
