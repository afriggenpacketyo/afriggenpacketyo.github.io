The document, which details payments for expeditions, was one of 15 pages stolen from Mexico's national archives sometime between 1985 and 1993. The FBI's art crime team located the historically significant artifact in the United States and facilitated its repatriation, underscoring a commitment to countering the trafficking of protected cultural property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has developed a groundbreaking genomic tool that could revolutionize the detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of the disease. The technology, called "Uni-C," can perform a comprehensive analysis of a patient's DNA from a single blood sample in less than a day by decoding information from rare circulating tumor cells. This rapid and accurate method promises to significantly improve early screening, monitoring, and the development of personalized treatments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific research is challenging the long-held 10,000-steps-a-day goal, suggesting a more achievable target may be just as effective. A comprehensive review of studies found that taking around 7,000 steps per day is associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking only 2,000. While more steps are not harmful, the research indicates that the most significant health benefits are seen up to this 7,000-step threshold, offering a realistic goal for many people.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.7% growth but better than the 0.1% forecast by economists. According to the Office for National Statistics, growth was driven primarily by the services sector, with construction also expanding. This better-than-expected performance provides a sliver of positive news, though analysts doubt the pace can be maintained amid global uncertainty and the impact of tax rises.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a Rhode Island man who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, has been found guilty of a 2008 sexual assault in a Utah court.

Analysts note that the move could also create an unexpected opportunity for counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China, as the BLA has also been responsible for fatal attacks targeting Chinese nationals and interests in the region.</p>
