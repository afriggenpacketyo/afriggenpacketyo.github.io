          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts," noting that recent protests in the city were not significantly violent or disruptive. The ruling addresses constitutional principles regarding the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement and the balance of power between federal and state governments. The White House has indicated it will likely appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza in the near future, following Hamas's agreement to key parts of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. The proposal includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli military withdrawal from parts of Gaza. While Hamas has accepted some terms, negotiations are ongoing in Egypt to finalize technical details, such as the decommissioning of weapons. The plan, outlined by President Trump, aims for a sustainable peace, though Netanyahu has signaled that a full Israeli withdrawal is not guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The act of queuing for hours for product launches or store openings has evolved from a mere inconvenience into a celebrated social activity. For events like new cosmetic store openings, people are gathering not just for the products but for the shared experience and sense of community. Psychologists note that the anticipation of a reward releases dopamine, making the wait feel exciting, especially for exclusive or limited items. Brands are capitalizing on this by using "experiential marketing," offering freebies, entertainment, and social media-worthy moments to turn long lines into a key part of their promotional strategy.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first-ever Black presiding bishop. This historic moment marks a significant step for the church, which is over 95% white but has been working to support multicultural ministries. Rev. Curry, who grew up Catholic on Chicago's south side, will lead the 2.7 million-member denomination for a six-year term. His installation is seen as a crucial moment that could help elevate the long-standing contributions of African Americans to Lutheranism and encourage more leaders of color within the church.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators participated in a Pride march in the Hungarian city of Pecs, defying a police ban on LGBTQ+ rallies. The event proceeded despite a law passed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's conservative government that allows such marches to be prohibited, ostensibly to "protect children." Protesters, including some Members of the European Parliament, waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning what they see as the government's restriction of fundamental human rights. The march highlights the ongoing tension between Hungary's government and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The UCLA football team, which had been winless this season, secured a shocking 42-37 victory against the seventh-ranked Penn State Nittany Lions. The win came just days after tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel was promoted to playcaller, and his new offensive scheme proved highly effective. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a standout performance, accounting for five touchdowns and leading the Bruins to score on their first five drives. The unexpected victory provided a moment of celebration and relief for a team that had recently undergone a major coaching shakeup amid a difficult season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," the wave of cold-like illness that sweeps through university campuses at the start of the academic year, is an expected phenomenon driven by a unique convergence of factors. Immunologists explain that bringing together thousands of students from diverse locations creates a "mixing pot" of viruses to which many have no prior immunity. This is compounded by lifestyle changes common during the first few weeks of university, such as stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all of which weaken the immune system. The result is a rapid spread of common respiratory viruses.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from keeping unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The ruling by Judge Rudolph Contreras found that automatically transferring these young adults to ICE adult detention centers violates a 2021 court order. That previous order mandated they be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless they pose a danger or flight risk. This decision is the latest legal setback for the administration's immigration policies, which have faced criticism for their treatment of minors.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative politician, is set to become Japan's first female prime minister after being elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, she is known for her staunch conservative views, including opposition to same-sex marriage, though she has recently focused on policies supporting working women and caregivers. Takaichi, a former government minister and one-time heavy metal drummer, has long aspired to be Japan's "Iron Lady." Her leadership will involve navigating voter trust issues and responding to a rising far-right movement.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square for a weekly protest, this time with a more hopeful tone following Hamas's acceptance of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal. Many attendees expressed gratitude toward President Trump for succeeding where they believe their own government has failed in securing a deal for the hostages' return. While there was a sense of optimism, many protesters remained skeptical, fearing that Prime Minister Netanyahu might find a way to sabotage the agreement to remain in power. The rally underscored a deep public desire to bring the hostages home and end the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>A last-minute winner in the Edinburgh derby has propelled Hearts FC to a five-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership, fueling excitement and title dreams among their supporters. While head coach Derek McInnes remains professionally cautious, he acknowledged that fans have every right to be excited by the team's unbeaten start to the season. The club's strong performance follows a significant £10m investment from Tony Bloom. Pundits note that while maintaining this form is challenging, the early-season success gives the fanbase legitimate cause for optimism in a league typically dominated by Rangers and Celtic.</p>
