          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady, amidst expectations of higher inflation and reduced economic growth, keeping the key borrowing rate between 4.25%-4.5%. Despite this decision, the committee's "dot plot" still indicates the possibility of two rate cuts by the end of 2025, though future cuts for 2026 and 2027 were reduced. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank is positioned to wait for more economic clarity before making any policy adjustments.

Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow, but her defense argued that fellow law enforcement officers were responsible. The first trial ended in a mistrial, while the second trial included dramatic moments and conflicting narratives from both sides.

          <p>The Federal Reserve opted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a cautious approach amid potential effects of President Trump's tariff policies. The central bank's forecast indicates some concern about a possible resurgence of inflation, with the personal consumption expenditures index expected to rise. Despite this, the Fed projects two quarter-point interest-rate cuts over the remainder of 2025, defying Trump's calls for lower rates. Powell noted that tariffs would likely push up prices and weigh on economic activity, but the effects would depend on the ultimate level of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Democrats have chosen their nominees for the upcoming off-year election, with Sen. Ghazala Hashmi becoming the first Muslim and Indian-American nominated for a statewide office. Hashmi will face Republican John Reid, the first openly gay man to receive a major party's endorsement for statewide office in Virginia. Abigail Spanberger, the nominee for governor, will battle Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, guaranteeing that Virginia will have its first female governor.
