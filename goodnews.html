Several fintech companies, including eToro and Circle, have recently debuted successfully, signaling a potential reopening of the fintech IPO market. The success of Chime's IPO could influence other companies like Klarna and Gemini, who are also considering going public, though Chime's business model, primarily generating revenue through interchange fees, faces competition from incumbents like Square, PayPal, and SoFi (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a rebound in 2025, with registrations surging by 20% compared to the previous year.

This regulation has spurred a surge in corporate sales, particularly in Germany, as automakers seek to avoid hefty fines.
