          <p>Following pressure from the White House, Apple has announced plans to invest an additional $100 billion in its U.S. operations, aiming to bolster its domestic supply chain and manufacturing capabilities. The announcement came after President Trump threatened a potential 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors for companies not building facilities in the United States. As part of the commitment, Apple plans to increase spending on its domestic supply chain, create new data centers, and establish a smart glass production line in Kentucky.</p>

The company posted a net income of $642 million, attributing the strong performance to resilient travel demand despite early-quarter economic uncertainty. Nights and experiences booked increased by 7% to 134.4 million, also beating forecasts. In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb noted that travel demand accelerated from April through July and announced a new share repurchase program of up to $6 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings for a $10,000 deposit in either a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account, given the current interest rate environment. While both offer competitive rates, the CD provides a fixed return, guaranteeing the interest earned over the term, which is a significant advantage as economists anticipate potential rate cuts. In contrast, money market accounts have variable rates that would likely decrease following any reduction in the federal funds rate, making their future earnings less predictable.

Key recommendations include improving one's financial profile by boosting their credit score and lowering their debt-to-income ratio to appear as a more attractive borrower to lenders.
