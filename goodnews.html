        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was largely attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament, which boosted sales for clothing, footwear, and online retailers. The data release was delayed by two weeks after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) admitted to errors in its seasonal adjustments and apologized for concerns over statistical quality. While the monthly figures were positive, the ONS noted that sales in the three months leading to July had declined compared to the previous quarter.</p>

          <p>The Dearborn Heights Police Department in Michigan has introduced a new, optional uniform patch that features the words "POLICE" and "DEARBORN HEIGHTS" in both English and Arabic script. The department stated the patch was designed by an officer to honor the community's diversity, particularly its large population of residents with Arabic heritage. The initiative is intended to represent unity and respect between law enforcement and the community. The announcement has drawn some criticism online, including from a Florida state representative who suggested it was a step towards Sharia law.</p>

          <p>DW Akademie, in partnership with a local organization, is launching the Floresta Digital project to address the lack of internet connectivity in isolated communities in northern Brazil. The initiative aims to provide these communities with self-governed, sustainable internet access, which is currently limited by poor quality and high costs. By improving connectivity, the project seeks to enhance access to reliable information, enable greater participation in political and economic life, and allow local producers to market their goods more widely. The project specifically targets vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples and Afro-Brazilian communities.</p>

          <p>A rigorous new study has found that a single dose of LSD can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression for several months. The research involved 198 adults with generalized anxiety disorder, showing that participants who received higher doses of 100 or 200 micrograms experienced strong improvements by the next day, which were sustained for 12 weeks. Lower doses were not more effective than a placebo. This study, testing a proprietary form of LSD called MM120, adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs for psychiatric conditions.</p>

          <p>Despite high public support for organ donation in the U.S., a significant gap exists between the number of registered donors and actual transplants, leaving over 100,000 people on waiting lists. This article explains that the primary bottleneck for deceased donations is medical, as only about three in 1,000 people die in circumstances that keep organs viable for transplant. For living donations, psychological barriers, a lack of awareness, and significant out-of-pocket costs for donors create major obstacles. These factors combine to create a persistent shortage, even with widespread public approval of the practice.</p>

          <p>Danish renewables company Orsted has received shareholder approval for a crucial $9.4 billion rights issue aimed at securing its financial stability. The move comes after the company faced significant turmoil, including a recent order from the Trump administration to halt construction on its nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the U.S. East Coast. Orsted is currently suing the administration to resume work on the wind farm. The successful capital raise provided a reprieve for the company, whose shares have fallen sharply since 2021 amid industry-wide challenges and political pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world's largest iceberg, known as A23a, is rapidly breaking apart and melting as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic. Having calved from Antarctica's Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in 1986, the iceberg spent decades grounded on the seafloor before beginning its final journey in 2023. At its peak, A23a was roughly the size of the island of Oahu. Scientists, who have tracked the nearly 40-year-old iceberg throughout its existence, say its demise is part of a natural life cycle and not directly linked to climate change.</p>

The plan includes cultivating internationally influential sports companies and hosting more major global sporting events. The 2030 goal represents a near doubling of the sector's value from 2023, when it accounted for just over 1% of the national GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A notable trend is emerging in U.S. politics regarding the ambitions of younger candidates from the two major parties. While more than 20 Democrats under the age of 40 have announced congressional bids, many of them challenging established incumbents, young Republicans appear to be taking a more patient approach. Republican organizers suggest their generation is more content with current leadership and prefers to wait for open seats rather than launching primary challenges. This difference highlights a generational divide within the Democratic party that is less apparent on the Republican side.</p>
