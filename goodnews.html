          <p>During a visit to mainland China, former Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou explicitly called for a "peaceful and democratic" unification between Taiwan and the mainland. This marked the first time the former Kuomintang chairman has articulated this specific vision on unification while in China. He stressed that any such process must not involve the use or threat of force and must ultimately respect the will of the Taiwanese people, a stance that adds a nuanced perspective to cross-strait dialogue.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made a significant climbdown on its planned welfare reforms to avoid a defeat in Parliament from its own backbenchers. The concessions will protect current recipients of certain disability and sickness benefits, with proposed cuts now set to apply only to future claimants. While the move has placated many rebels and likely ensures the bill's passage, it represents a notable U-turn and raises questions about how the government will fund the changes.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen's new box set, "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," is reviewed as an epic project of pop archiving that reshapes the artist's narrative. The collection of 83 unreleased songs, organized into seven distinct LPs, reveals his ambivalence toward 1980s superstardom and his experimental, genre-spanning work during the 1990s. This release is seen as a deliberate act of lore maintenance, deepening the understanding of Springsteen's complex artistic journey even during his most famous periods.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the US military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was not an aberration but a direct application of President Trump's 'America First' foreign policy. The author defines this doctrine not as isolationism, but as a pragmatic realism that avoids nation-building while remaining willing to use decisive force to protect core US interests. The successful strike, achieved without American casualties, is presented as a major foreign policy victory and a vindication of this approach.</p>
