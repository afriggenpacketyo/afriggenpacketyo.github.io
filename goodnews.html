Todd and Julie, known for their reality TV show "Chrisley Knows Best," had been serving sentences in separate federal institutions. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, had been advocating for their release and reached out to Trump for a pardon after their conviction was upheld, emphasizing the importance of family unity.

The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) expressed solidarity, stating the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the funds to the players, despite FIFA paying MLS teams significant amounts to participate. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The MLSPA says they have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal. </p>
