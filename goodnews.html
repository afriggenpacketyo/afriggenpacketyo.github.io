          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to ride comfort issues in high-speed maglev trains, potentially improving vacuum-tube maglev technology. A study showed that even minor track imperfections could cause violent vibrations at cruising speeds of 1,000km/h, leading to an "extremely unpleasant" ride. The engineers, working on a full-scale test line in China, reported reducing turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort to "pronounced, but not unpleasant" levels using supercomputer simulations and prototype tests.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, demonstrating significant progress, but an apparent propellant leak led to a loss of control, causing the spacecraft to re-enter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled and likely disintegrate over the Indian Ocean. The mission, launched from Starbase, Texas, aimed to test payload deployment and heat shield improvements, but the inability to open the payload doors prevented the Starlink satellite deployment test. Despite the challenges, SpaceX continues to gather valuable data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions to the moon and Mars.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but both stages were lost before controlled descents could be achieved. The Super Heavy first stage failed catastrophically upon engine reignition, while the Starship upper stage reached its suborbital trajectory but experienced a door failure preventing the release of simulated Starlink satellites. An apparent propellant leak then caused the Starship to spin out of control, leading to its breakup during reentry; however, Elon Musk noted the mission's significant improvements and valuable data gained, with plans for faster launch cadences in the future.</p>
