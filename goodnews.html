        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly promoting public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This new approach aims to address African governments' debt concerns by granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Several high-profile projects, including Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway, the stalled Kenyan railway, and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway, are being considered under the PPP model, with Chinese infrastructure financiers potentially contributing up to 40% of project costs in exchange for exclusive construction and operation rights for a minimum of 25 years.</p>

          <p>Chris Smith, an Illinois man, survived a gunshot to the brain after a first date turned tragic, defying low expectations for his recovery. Smith's date, Leslie Reeves, was found dead at his home, while Smith was rushed to the hospital and placed in a medically induced coma. After waking up without any memory of the event, Smith underwent intense physical therapy and is now regaining his strength and aiming to walk without assistance. He has also returned to singing with his rock band and is engaged to be married, hoping to become a motivational speaker.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. will solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff in Japan as part of a turnaround plan, while Taiwan has shut down its last operating nuclear power reactor, capping four decades of operation. A local government's decision to promote a bridge as a tourist spot for Mt. Fuji views has backfired due to resident complaints. A survey indicates that 81% of people in Japan feel "uneasy" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term due to concerns over tariffs, and most female executives doubt Japan will reach its goal of having women occupy 30% of top corporate roles by 2030.</p>

          <p>Despite a slowdown in broader luxury spending, wealthy shoppers are still investing in high-end jewelry, but they are becoming increasingly selective and favoring top brands. This trend is benefiting Swiss luxury group Richemont, which owns sought-after jewelry brands such as Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, and Cartier. Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by an 11% growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, highlighting the continued demand for luxury jewelry among affluent consumers.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers, pitching four uneven innings in an 11-9 loss to the Angels. Despite the loss, Kershaw's return provided a boost to the Dodgers, who are currently missing three starting pitchers due to injuries. Kershaw's performance included glimpses of his former skill, but his command was inconsistent, which he needs to improve going forward. The Angels won the game thanks to a career-high five RBIs from catcher Logan O'Hoppe, securing a series win against the Dodgers.</p>
