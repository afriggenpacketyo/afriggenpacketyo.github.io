          <p>Intel's stock rose by approximately 6% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking an equity stake in the chipmaker. President Trump stated the government should acquire about 10% of the company, with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, calling it a "great deal." While the White House confirmed ongoing discussions with Intel, officials noted that nothing has been finalized and CEO Lip-Bu Tan has not explicitly agreed to a deal. This potential move aligns with a shift in U.S. industrial policy, where the government actively participates in corporate America, specifically leveraging CHIPS Act funds. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously advocated for an equity stake in exchange for these funds, which were initially committed under the Biden administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that conditions "may warrant" future interest rate cuts, emphasizing the Fed's cautious approach amidst significant economic uncertainty. In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell noted "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies are shifting the balance of risks between full employment and stable prices. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he cited rising downside dangers and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, a stagflation scenario the Fed aims to avoid. Powell's remarks, which sent stocks soaring, suggested the current restrictive policy stance allows for careful adjustments, hinting at a possible September rate cut while reaffirming the Fed's independence from political pressure.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company is in talks with the U.S. government regarding the potential sale of a new, more advanced AI chip, the B30A, to China. This development follows previous U.S. restrictions on exports of Nvidia's H20 chip due to concerns about its potential use in Chinese military applications. Huang has consistently advocated for allowing Nvidia to sell its chips to China, aiming to ensure that the country's AI development relies on American technology and prevents domestic tech giants like Huawei from filling the void. The situation is further complicated by recent reports of Chinese authorities raising security concerns about Nvidia's chips and urging local companies to avoid them, highlighting ongoing geopolitical tensions in the tech sector.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, though levies on autos, steel, and aluminum will remain. This decision follows a phone call with President Donald Trump and aims to "re-establish free trade for the vast majority" of goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). The move, effective September 1st, is welcomed by the White House, which called it "long overdue." Carney emphasized preserving Canada's unique trade advantage with the U.S. amid a scheduled USMCA review next year, despite criticism from some Canadian unions viewing it as backing down to Trump's trade aggression.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack expressed significant hesitation about lowering interest rates, citing persistent inflation threats. Her comments, made in a CNBC interview, diverged from the market's enthusiasm, which was sparked by Chair Jerome Powell's earlier speech hinting at potential policy easing. Hammack, who will be a rate-setting voter in 2026, emphasized the critical need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to the 2% target, which has been exceeded for four years. She voiced concern that an overly accommodative policy could "reinvigorate inflationary pressures," highlighting a more cautious perspective within the Federal Reserve despite the strong market expectations for a September rate cut, indicating internal debate on the economic outlook.

This out-of-court settlement concludes a lengthy legal battle where claimants sought damages for lost property and health complications. While the exact sum wasn't confirmed by the UK, the lawyer for the Kenyans stated it was £2.9 million. The British High Commission expressed regret for the "extremely regrettable" incident, which was likely caused by a camp stove and damaged around 7,000 acres of private land. Despite the settlement, some clients felt the compensation was insufficient for their losses.</p>

Retail executives reported that while tariff costs are increasing, consumer spending has remained largely strong, and the impact hasn't been as severe as initially feared. Companies are employing mitigation strategies such as diversifying sourcing, negotiating with vendors, and strategic pricing. Walmart, for instance, has selectively raised prices but also expanded discounts elsewhere. This article highlights the ongoing efforts by retailers to absorb or manage tariff-related expenses without significantly burdening shoppers, though some lower-income households are more sensitive to price adjustments.

While some reports predict millions of new AI-created roles, a recent MIT study found 95% of generative AI implementations failed to boost revenue, often due to companies not redesigning workflows.

Her journey highlights how spiritual understanding can emerge from mundane moments and cultural immersion, connecting with the nature-worship of Shinto traditions. Ultimately, a Buddhist reverend's advice to "embrace ambiguity" helped Groff understand Murasaki's writing and gain personal insight, underscoring the transformative potential of such deep cultural engagement.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a reliable savings option, offering guaranteed returns and principal protection, especially with current rates around 4%. A $10,000 deposit can yield noticeable interest over time, with specific earnings varying by term. For example, a 3-month CD at 4.30% APY earns about $107.50, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% APY could net approximately $2,100. CDs lock in rates, providing predictability unlike fluctuating savings accounts, and are FDIC insured up to $250,000. Choosing the right term balances liquidity needs with earning potential. Experts suggest acting sooner rather than later to lock in current rates, as they may decrease in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
