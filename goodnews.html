          <h2>Texas Pushes Back Against Foreign Land Acquisition with New Legislation</h2>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent hostile foreign powers, including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, from acquiring land within the state. The bill targets entities affiliated with governments deemed national security threats, prohibiting them from purchasing real estate that poses risks to public health or safety. The legislation empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals, with exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and personal homesteads. Supporters emphasize that the bill focuses on actions and affiliations, not race or nationality, to protect Texans from foreign espionage and influence.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton revealed a $1.4 billion settlement with Google over claims that the tech giant collected user data without permission, encompassing geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data. The settlement, the largest of its kind, signals Texas's commitment to protecting consumer rights and freedoms against Big Tech overreach. Google maintains the settlement addresses old claims and that it has already updated its product policies, clarifying that no new product changes are required as part of the agreement. This follows a similar settlement with Meta, underscoring Texas's aggressive stance on data privacy.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni regarding allegations surrounding their 2024 film, "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson denounces the subpoena as a ploy to generate tabloid attention, emphasizing her minimal involvement with the film, limited to permitting the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet." Lively and Baldoni are embroiled in lawsuits involving allegations of sexual harassment and defamation, with Baldoni claiming Lively's wealthy and influential friends, including Swift, are making things difficult for him.

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that approximately 39% of residents experience loneliness at times, despite the implementation of a law last year aimed at addressing isolation. The study also explored the correlation between loneliness and smartphone usage, finding that those who used smartphones for more than eight hours a day reported higher levels of loneliness. The most frequently cited factor contributing to loneliness was the bereavement of a family member, highlighting the complex social challenges facing Japan.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to Texas to settle lawsuits accusing the company of violating the privacy of state residents. Attorney General Ken Paxton brought the suits in 2022, alleging Google tracked users' locations and searches, and collected facial recognition information without consent. Google's settlement is the latest legal setback for the tech giant, which has lost a string of antitrust cases over the past two years. Google has been challenged under state laws that curb the collection of facial, voice and other biometric data.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere this weekend after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit. Experts predict the spacecraft, equipped with a heat shield, may partially survive the re-entry, though the exact landing location remains unknown. The spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, covering a wide swath of the Earth, and if any pieces of the spacecraft are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff rate.

Investors are eager for a resolution to the trade war, which has spurred market volatility.

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians and artists are urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, requiring transparency from AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. They warn that failing to provide this protection would essentially give away their work to tech firms, jeopardizing the UK's position as a creative powerhouse. The artists support an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, which aims to facilitate licensing agreements between creators and AI companies. Not everyone agrees with the artists' approach, with some arguing such proposals could hamper the UK and its bid for growth.</p>
