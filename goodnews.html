        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize an agreement to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been paused due to a last-minute legal injunction granted by a High Court judge. The injunction was sought by two Chagossian women who filed a case against the Foreign Office. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using an airbase on the archipelago, but the legal challenge has temporarily blocked the signing ceremony that was expected to occur on Thursday morning.</p>

          <p>The House is expected to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, following the release of an updated version aimed at securing enough Republican votes. The legislation addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, and has faced opposition from various factions within the GOP. A 42-page amendment includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits. The bill is expected to face resistance in the Senate even if it passes the House, as numerous Republicans have expressed intentions to seek changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka are two Indian women artists using their art to challenge societal norms and express personal experiences. Khemka, who is hearing-impaired, explores sound through vibration in her interdisciplinary works, while Chari focuses on the female body and challenges how women are seen in Indian society. Chari's work has faced controversy and rejection from Indian galleries, but resonates strongly with Indian women who see their experiences reflected in her art. Both artists have garnered international attention and offer advice to aspiring young artists, encouraging them to remain free and independent thinkers.</p>

          <p>China has expressed strong opposition to the European Union's proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The EU is proposing a two-euro fee for parcels valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the EU to maintain a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies, emphasizing the importance of open trade.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price surged, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and support from President Trump have further boosted the cryptocurrency market.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng have risen sharply in Hong Kong following positive earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts predict Xpeng will become profitable in the fourth quarter of this year due to strong sales and new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by increased vehicle deliveries. The brokerage UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock, projecting significant upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>
