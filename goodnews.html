        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eagles star Saquon Barkley voiced his opposition to efforts to ban the 'tush push' play in the NFL, calling the attempts "soft." He argued that any team can execute the play, but the Eagles' success is due to their strong offensive line and Jalen Hurts' strength. Barkley also dismissed claims that the play is unsafe. The proposed rule change would have prohibited offensive players from pushing teammates lined up behind the center at the snap.</p>

          <p>The new Syrian government has agreed to assist the U.S. in locating and returning missing Americans, signaling improved relations between the two countries. U.S. Special Envoy Thomas Barrack described this as a "power step forward" and emphasized the importance of closure for the families of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and Kayla Mueller. This announcement follows a meeting between Barrack and Syrian leaders in Turkey and the Trump administration's decision to grant Syria sanctions exemptions. The goal is to enable the new Syrian government to create conditions for the Syrian people to thrive and ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.</p>

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after a passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. Fellow passengers and crew members restrained the individual, who was later determined to be experiencing a medical crisis and was transported to a local hospital. While on the tarmac in Seattle, a second unrelated incident occurred with another unruly passenger who was also removed by police. The flight eventually continued to Houston after the incidents.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill, calling it the "largest cut in spending in at least 30 years" and dismissing concerns that it will increase federal deficits. This is in contrast to a recent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, which suggested that the tax provisions in the package could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Johnson argued that the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion, despite skepticism from some Republican senators.</p>
