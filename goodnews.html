        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers highlight the release of Peter Sullivan, wrongly convicted of murder in 1986, after 38 years in jail due to new DNA evidence. The Daily Mirror calls it a "justice fiasco," while the Daily Mail describes it as "one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice," noting Sullivan may receive a ¬£1m payout. The Times and Daily Express focus on research indicating that new weight-loss drugs, GLP-1 agonists, could halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks, potentially benefiting over half the UK population and alleviating pressure on the NHS. Other news includes counter-terrorism police investigating a blaze at the PM's home and Chinese criticism of the UK-US trade accord.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The number of family offices is expected to grow to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets. However, McKinsey estimates a shortage of approximately 100,000 advisors by 2034. Family offices often prioritize trust over other qualifications, leading to selectivity and difficulty in filling roles that require a combination of skills, such as a chief investment officer and CFO. To attract talent, some families are willing to pay a salary premium, but young employees remain hesitant due to a lack of clear corporate structure and career progression opportunities.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by releasing ‚Äústandard‚Äù names for dozens of places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region China calls Zangnan. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs published names for 27 geographical features in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin, along with detailed coordinates and a high-resolution map. This move comes despite recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries after a deadly military clash in the Galwan Valley in 2020 and a subsequent military standoff at the shared border. Late last year, China and India agreed to end their military standoff at the Himalayan border.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the plan to American special envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman, suggesting Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. This proposal aims to create a permanent arrangement, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would include on-the-ground oversight from other countries, potentially including the United States. While the idea is new and untested, it represents an attempt to move beyond maximalist demands and avert a potential military confrontation.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's administration reduces funding for American research institutions, countries worldwide are attempting to attract displaced or disillusioned American researchers. The United States has historically been a magnet for top scientific talent, but budget cuts and restrictive policies are creating a "brain gain opportunity" for rival nations. The European Union, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, and Australia are among those offering financial incentives, academic freedom, and social safety nets to entice American researchers. While salaries may be lower in some countries, factors like free healthcare and education are appealing to those considering leaving the United States.</p>
