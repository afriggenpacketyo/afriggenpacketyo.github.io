          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain humanities majors, such as nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects for recent college graduates. The article highlights that while computer science and engineering graduates face higher unemployment rates, graduates with degrees in art history and nutritional sciences are experiencing lower rates. BlackRock's COO noted the increasing need for individuals with backgrounds in history and English, signaling a shift in hiring strategies driven by the rise of artificial intelligence and the demand for creative thinking. The healthcare sector also shows resilience, with high demand for nursing majors due to the ongoing need for healthcare professionals (not investment advice).</p>
