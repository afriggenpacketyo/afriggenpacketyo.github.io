          <p>Google is using its prominent homepage 'Doodle' space to promote its new "AI Mode," a chatbot-like search experience designed to answer complex user questions. This move signals a significant effort by the company to increase user exposure to its latest artificial intelligence features amid growing competition from startups like OpenAI and Perplexity AI. AI Mode, which is powered by Google's Gemini model, integrates AI-generated responses directly into the search results page. The company describes the homepage feature as a "fun promo" rather than a traditional Doodle celebrating history or culture, underscoring its strategic push into generative AI.</p>

          <p>Jake Paul, the social media influencer turned professional boxer, has officially been ranked by the World Boxing Association, making him eligible to compete for a world title. The WBA listed Paul as its No. 14 cruiserweight contender following his recent unanimous decision victory over former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. This marks a significant milestone in a career that began with fights against fellow YouTubers and has since progressed to more credible opponents. Paul, who holds a 12-1 record, stated that becoming a world champion is his "desired ultimate destination" and expressed confidence in his ability to challenge top fighters.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG." The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory concerns, which resulted in a $1 billion termination fee for Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with revenue increasing 46% in the first quarter to $228.2 million and a growing list of high-value clients. The IPO is seen as a positive sign for the tech market and a potential win for its major venture capital backers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, three megacap tech stocks‚ÄîMicrosoft, Nvidia, and Meta‚Äîhave outperformed their "Magnificent Seven" peers, ending the first half of 2025 at all-time highs. Cramer noted that Microsoft's stock surged after its Azure cloud business beat growth expectations, while Nvidia rallied due to sustained high demand for its superior AI chips. Meta's strong performance was attributed to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to quarterly earnings that far surpassed estimates. These three companies have emerged as the leaders from what was once the market's most captivating group of stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy has demonstrated resilience through a turbulent first six months of 2025, navigating U.S. trade policy shifts while maintaining steady growth toward its annual 5% GDP target. However, experts warn that significant challenges lie ahead for the second half of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have helped offset declining shipments to the U.S., some analysts forecast that export growth will slow or even contract. These predictions are based on the effects of front-loaded orders and an anticipated slowdown in American consumer spending, suggesting an uphill climb for Beijing to sustain its economic momentum.

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4m fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month before his Liverpool contract expired has already proven financially astute. The investment was made to ensure his availability for the Club World Cup, and his performance has been pivotal. An assist from Alexander-Arnold in the match against Juventus led to a goal that secured an extra ¬£10m for the club, more than covering his transfer cost. While questions about his defensive work remain, the English right-back is adapting well to his new team and role, contributing to Madrid's successful tournament run.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:37:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a major housing reform bill that significantly overhauls the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to streamline construction. The new law, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This change aims to eliminate lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that have historically delayed or blocked development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the reform removes a key tool that opponents have long used to challenge housing projects, signaling a major political shift toward prioritizing development.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon, has sold over 3.3 million shares of the company, valued at approximately $737 million. The sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that Bezos adopted in March, under which he intends to sell up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains Amazon's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock in recent years to fund other ventures, including his space exploration company Blue Origin and his non-profit preschool network. The transaction was disclosed shortly after his highly publicized wedding celebration in Venice. (not investment advice)</p>
