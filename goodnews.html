          <p>The recently merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, signaling a major potential consolidation in the media industry. News of the prospective bid caused shares of Warner Bros. Discovery to surge by more than 25%. This move comes shortly after Paramount and Skydance completed their own merger, indicating an aggressive growth strategy under the new leadership of David Ellison as the industry continues to navigate the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming.</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining a key concern for those on fixed incomes, this article examines the role of annuities in a retirement strategy. It explains that while traditional fixed annuities offer predictable payments, their purchasing power can be significantly eroded over time by rising prices. The article explores alternatives like variable and indexed annuities that offer potential inflation hedges but come with higher risks and complexity, and also discusses the option of adding an inflation protection rider to an annuity contract.

          <p>This article details the inspiring journey of USC running back Waymond Jordan, who has emerged as a star player after being completely overlooked by major college programs in high school. With no scholarship offers, Jordan enrolled in a junior college, where he battled injuries and a redshirt season before his talent began to shine. His decision to bet on himself and stay an extra year in junior college ultimately paid off, as he became the national player of the year and earned his place at a top-tier football program.</p>

          <p>A fundamental shift has occurred in the composition of Elon Musk's wealth, with his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, now accounting for a larger portion of his fortune than his Tesla stock. According to a Tesla proxy filing, the soaring valuations of these private ventures mean Musk has more attractive financial options outside the electric car company. This argument is being used to justify a proposed record-breaking pay package, which Tesla claims is necessary to ensure Musk remains focused on its future.</p>

          <p>Home mortgage rates in the U.S. have experienced their largest one-week decline in the past year, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.35%. This significant drop, which brings rates to their lowest level since last October, is attributed to recent data indicating a weakening labor market. The more favorable borrowing conditions have prompted an immediate and strong response from consumers, leading to a surge in both home purchase and refinancing applications to their highest levels in months.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has extended and reinforced an order limiting the use of "less-lethal" weapons, such as foam projectiles and tear gas, by federal agents at protests in Los Angeles. In his ruling, the judge dismissed the government's argument that it is impractical to distinguish between journalists and protesters in chaotic situations, stating the First Amendment "deserves better." The decision marks a significant victory for a coalition of press rights organizations that sued to curb what they termed the "violent, chaotic invasion" of federal forces.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Patrick Reed has spoken out against the decision to pay American players for their participation in the Ryder Cup, deeming the practice "unnecessary." He argues that the honor of representing one's country, similar to competing in the Olympics, should be the sole motivation, rather than a financial stipend. Reed also offered his perspective that the European team often holds an advantage in the competition due to what he perceives as a stronger sense of camaraderie and team unity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new estimates based on August inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries may receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) between 2.7% and 2.8% for 2026. This would represent a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. However, the article cautions that this gain could be largely offset by expected increases in Medicare Part B premiums, a common issue that erodes the real-world value of the COLA for many seniors.
