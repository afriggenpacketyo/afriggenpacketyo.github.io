          <p>Manchester United is reportedly initiating discussions with Brentford to potentially acquire striker Bryan Mbeumo during the summer transfer window. United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, is prioritizing the addition of striking power to enhance the team's attacking capabilities following a season with limited goal-scoring success. While Matheus Cunha has already agreed to join United, the club is confident in pursuing Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals for Brentford last season, after receiving indications that Manchester United is his preferred destination. Mbeumo is seen as a versatile and dynamic player, although not a natural number nine, and Amorim seeks flexible players to bolster the squad.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election prompted by the ousting of Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for attempting to establish martial law in December. Approximately 44.4 million South Koreans are casting ballots, with a high turnout rate of roughly 71.5% reported so far.

          <p>The recent summit in Kuala Lumpur between leaders of Asean, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and China marks a significant convergence of economic powerhouses, representing over 2 billion people and a combined economy of nearly US$25 trillion. Emphasizing deeper cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure, and finance, the summit focused on green energy, digital transformation, connectivity, and sustainable agriculture. This trilateral partnership aligns with China's Belt and Road Initiative, leveraging Asean's consumer markets, the GCC's energy wealth, and China's manufacturing and technological prowess, offering a transformative opportunity to reduce reliance on the US market by diversifying supply chains and focusing on complementary strengths.</p>

          <p>Dame Tipping Primary School in east London has instructed pupils to stay indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground. Concerns arose after reports of the bird swooping on residents, leading Havering Council to provide advice, including deterrents and potentially hiring a falconry expert. The buzzard, nicknamed Brenda by the pupils, is believed to be protecting its nest or chicks, and because buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited. The school is using this as a learning opportunity, incorporating the buzzard into art, stories, and other projects, while a bird of prey expert visited the school to educate children about birds of prey.</p>

          <p>Borussia Dortmund is confident in completing the signing of Sunderland midfielder Jobe Bellingham. The 19-year-old has attracted significant interest from clubs across Europe, especially after helping Sunderland return to the Premier League for the first time since 2017. Dortmund believes they are in a strong position to secure Bellingham's signature, as they have received indications that he wants to follow in his brother Jude's footsteps by joining them, with an agreement expected to be reached eventually. Dortmund's bargaining position has been strengthened by a strong end to the season, securing a place in the Champions League.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to an F1 Q&A. The first error was ordering Max Verstappen to give back his position to George Russell after an incident in Turn One, a decision based on perceived penalties. The stewards later ruled no further action was needed, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. The second mistake was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a move that Verstappen vocally questioned, and which Horner later admitted they should have left him out on soft tires.</p>
