          <p>Oracle's stock value increased by over 5% after a regulatory filing disclosed a new cloud services agreement projected to generate more than $30 billion in annual revenue. The revenue from this significant deal is anticipated to begin impacting the company's finances in the 2028 fiscal year. This announcement contributes to Oracle's strong performance in 2025, which has been bolstered by growth in its cloud sector and numerous strategic AI partnerships, including ventures with OpenAI and IBM. The company's shares have seen a substantial rise of over 33% this year, reflecting strong investor confidence in its strategic direction and future growth prospects.</p>

The new teams will join the league sequentially, with Cleveland starting in 2028, Detroit in 2029, and Philadelphia in 2030.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu has made its advanced Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that experts believe will intensify competition in the global AI market. This decision marks a strategic shift for Baidu, which previously advocated for proprietary models, and is seen as a response to the success of other open-source disruptors like DeepSeek. Analysts suggest that by making a powerful model widely and cheaply available, Baidu could challenge the pricing structures of closed-source providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. The release is expected to empower developers worldwide but also raises questions about data security and market trust, particularly in Western enterprise settings.</p>

The acquisition will be executed through Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, and is expected to be finalized by early 2026. This move also concludes a potential hostile takeover attempt of GMS by billionaire Brad Jacobs's company, QXO, solidifying Home Depot's competitive position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is increasingly turning to Taiwan as a source for drones and their components, aiming to diversify its supply chain and reduce its heavy reliance on China. A recent report indicates Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by cybersecurity concerns and Western pressure over China's ties to Russia. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focusing on sourcing critical components like software and chips from Taiwan. This move is part of Taiwan's broader strategy to build a "non-red" supply chain independent of Chinese influence, bolstering its own defense capabilities.</p>

The speculation, first reported by Kyodo news agency, has not been confirmed by the Chinese foreign ministry, which stated it had no information to provide on the matter. The potential visit comes amidst ongoing trade tensions, although Trump himself recently hinted at a possible trip to China "at a certain point" following a phone call with President Xi Jinping.

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has proposed new online safety measures that would compel tech platforms to more actively prevent illegal content from going viral. The proposals, now open for consultation, also include limiting virtual gifting to children on livestreams and requiring larger platforms to proactively detect terrorist material. These measures aim to build upon the existing Online Safety Act to address evolving online harms, particularly those affecting children. While the move is welcomed by some, safety advocates like the Molly Rose Foundation argue the proposals are insufficient and do not address systemic weaknesses in the current law.</p>

This contrasts with past statements where he suggested he might be the last, leaving the decision up to the Tibetan people.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time since the recent inflationary period began. This preliminary data was lower than the 2.2% anticipated by analysts and could provide the ECB with more confidence that its monetary policy is effectively taming price pressures across the eurozone. While the news is positive, economists note that persistent service inflation remains a concern. The disinflationary trend has been aided by external factors, and the ECB is expected to remain cautious before considering further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
