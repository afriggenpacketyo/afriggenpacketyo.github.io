        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly evaluating a broad list of eleven candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chair. Among the newly surfaced contenders are prominent financial figures David Zervos of Jefferies and Rick Rieder from BlackRock, expanding a list that already includes several current and former Fed officials. The selection is being managed as a "deliberative process" by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will narrow the field before presenting a final list to the president. This thorough approach indicates a decision may take considerable time, potentially easing concerns about abrupt policy shifts or market instability during the transition period.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 08:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. mortgage application volume saw a significant increase last week, driven by a 23% jump in refinancing demand as interest rates slightly decreased. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that this surge was the strongest for refinancing since last April, with a notable rise in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are considered riskier loan products. While homeowners are actively seeking savings, demand from potential homebuyers remained sluggish, with purchase applications rising only 1%. This trend suggests borrowers with larger existing loans are more sensitive to rate fluctuations than new buyers facing historically high home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sig Hansen, the 59-year-old captain from the show "Deadliest Catch," has opened up about how multiple life-threatening health scares at sea have altered his perspective on life. The veteran fisherman told Fox News Digital that surviving a heart attack and a severe infection has made him more fearful of his dangerous profession but also more appreciative of his family. Hansen stated that these close calls with his own mortality have shifted his priorities, making him want to spend more time with his wife, daughters, and grandchild. He now feels a greater responsibility to be present for his family after decades spent away on the Bering Sea.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China have developed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing, a significant advance in the field. The team, led by Pan Jianwei, successfully arranged over 2,000 rubidium atoms, each acting as a qubit, into precise patterns using an AI-controlled system of optical tweezers. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which have previously been limited to arrays of only a few hundred qubits. The breakthrough is seen as a major step toward building more powerful and stable quantum computers.</p>

          <p>During a Vox panel on entrepreneurship, business founders emphasized the importance of balancing creative passion with financial practicality, especially when starting with limited funds. One speaker highlighted the strategy of not defining a single target customer to maintain broad appeal, describing their brand's audience as a mix from "Bushwick to the Upper East Side." The panelists also discussed how being authentic and transparent on social media builds a loyal customer base that wants to support real people over large corporations. Ultimately, they advised new entrepreneurs to trust their own vision, as customers are most drawn to products the creators are genuinely proud of.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere has sold over 120,000 tickets for its upcoming immersive screenings of "The Wizard of Oz," with sales expected to reach 200,000 before the first show. Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan called the project "groundbreaking," stating it could significantly boost visitor attendance at the venue. The company used AI-powered technology to expand the classic 1939 film's frames to fit the massive screen, creating a unique experience enhanced by 4D elements like haptic seats and custom scents. Despite the high cost of the project, analysts see the film as a major, underappreciated catalyst for the company's stock.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a five-year, $3 billion investment to expand its U.S. manufacturing operations, which will create over 1,000 jobs. As part of this plan, the company will shift production of some refrigerators and clothes washers from China, and gas ranges from Mexico, to its plants in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina. CEO Kevin Nolan stated the strategy is to manufacture closer to customers, leveraging lean manufacturing and automation to make U.S. production viable. This move accelerates the company's reshoring efforts, influenced in part by U.S. tariffs on foreign goods.</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to purchase the Google Chrome browser. This move comes as the U.S. Department of Justice proposes that Google be forced to sell Chrome following a landmark antitrust ruling that found the company illegally monopolized the search market. Chrome is central to Google's multi-billion dollar advertising business, as it allows for extensive data collection that enhances ad targeting. The potential sale of the world's most popular browser has also attracted interest from other major players, including OpenAI and Yahoo, signaling a potential shake-up in the digital landscape.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient, razor-toothed whale that lived 26 million years ago, naming it Janjucetus dullardi after the local who found its fossilized skull. The creature, about the size of a modern dolphin, was a member of the mammalodontids, a group of smaller, toothed relatives of today's large filter-feeding whales. Researchers described the species as a "fast, sharp-toothed predator" that was "deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless." The discovery was made along Victoria's Surf Coast, a region renowned for its rich deposits of early whale fossils.</p>

          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Texas that feels both familiar and like a fantasy in today's socially fragmented landscape. The show's focus on neighborly relations and community obligations offers a comforting, idealistic vision that seems increasingly rare. While the revival touches on modern issues like social media paranoia and the lingering effects of pandemic isolation, it largely avoids the deep political and cultural divisions of the real world. This deliberate choice allows the series to maintain its gentle, character-driven humor, reaffirming its core message about the value of community, even if it requires glossing over reality.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's summer trip to the picturesque Cotswolds in the U.K. was met with protests, as locals organized a "Vance not welcome party." Demonstrators held signs with messages like "Bullies not welcome here" and others that humorously mocked the Vice President, reflecting local frustration over his visit. The Stop Trump Coalition, which organized the event, cited Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's foreign policy positions as reasons for the outrage. The protest, described as a "joyous festival of resistance," garnered significant attention on social media.</p>

          <p>The new book "A Marriage at Sea" recounts the extraordinary survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, a British couple who spent 117 days adrift on a small inflatable raft in the Pacific Ocean in 1973. After a whale struck and sank their sailboat, the couple endured starvation and illness, surviving on rainwater and turtles. The book explores the dynamics of their relationship under extreme duress, highlighting Maralyn's optimism in keeping her more negative husband's spirits up. Their shared ordeal, and their constant planning for a future sailing trip, became a powerful bonding force that likely saved both their lives and their marriage.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has fallen below 5%. According to data from Moneyfacts, the rate has reached 4.99%, a figure described as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers that indicates increased competition among lenders. This easing of rates provides some relief for the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, analysts caution that rates are unlikely to fall substantially further, as inflation is forecast to remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing data from the devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck Myanmar in March 2025 hope their findings will enhance the ability to forecast future seismic events. The quake, the most powerful in the country since 1912, caused thousands of deaths and widespread destruction. A new study published in PNAS created a computer model incorporating the Sagaing Fault's history, or "memory effect," to better understand its behavior. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, researchers believe that refining these forecasting models is crucial for improving hazard assessments and disaster preparedness in seismically active regions around the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural analysis suggests that modern soccer design, from the 2026 World Cup logo to new club crests, is increasingly losing its unique edge in favor of a bland, corporate look. The article contrasts the generic feel of recent designs with the iconic, culturally-infused work of Lance Wyman for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. While designers like Matthew Wolff have created well-received, elegant crests for many U.S. clubs, the overall trend is influenced by marketing committees and focus groups that push for safer, more adaptable designs. This shift, the article argues, can rob a brand of the distinct character and artistic wonkiness that creates a lasting identity.</p>
