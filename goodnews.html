          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly instructed the Israel Defense Forces to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive measures. This significant shift aligns with a U.S.-backed peace plan proposed by former President Donald Trump, which has also garnered support from the World Health Organization. While some Israeli bombardment continued at a reduced intensity, the primary focus has now moved toward negotiations for the swift release of all hostages. An Israeli negotiating team is reportedly preparing to travel, possibly to Cairo, to begin talks in the coming days.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic winged Lion of St. Mark statue in Venice may have originated in Tang dynasty China as a tomb guardian. The researchers base their theory on stylistic similarities and lead isotope testing, which suggest the bronze figure was cast over 1,000 years ago using copper from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The analysis points to features like the lion's nose and teeth, which resemble those of mythical 'zhenmushou' beasts used in ancient Chinese burials. The study even speculates that the statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of famed explorer Marco Polo.</p>

          <p>A new film, 'The Smashing Machine,' starring Dwayne Johnson, chronicles the dramatic life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, whose career was derailed by addiction. The movie, directed by Benny Safdie, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that unflinchingly captured Kerr's struggles with opioids and alcohol at the height of his fame in Japan's Pride Fighting Championships. Johnson, who has been a longtime admirer of Kerr's story, is producing the film and has been praised for his transformative portrayal of the vulnerable fighter. For Kerr, now 56 and sober, the project represents a second chance at recognition and a reflection on his turbulent journey.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully completed his 'States of Elevation' project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The extraordinary endurance feat involved Jornet cycling between the peaks across six states and then running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles entirely under his own power. Jornet, widely considered the greatest mountain athlete of all time, undertook the challenge not just to test his physical limits but also to explore new landscapes and connect with the American wilderness. His approach focused on finding the "most aesthetic line," combining technical skill with a deep appreciation for the natural environment.</p>

          <p>This article delves into several surprising and often overlooked facts about the Nobel Prize's history, highlighting its complexities and controversies. It notes that Marie Curie is the only person to win in two different science fields, while her family collectively holds five Nobels. The piece also debunks the myth that Alfred Nobel excluded mathematics due to a personal grudge, suggesting instead he didn't see it as directly benefiting humanity. It further explores instances where deserving female scientists like Lise Meitner were overlooked, and prizes were awarded for discoveries, such as the lobotomy, that were later deemed harmful or incorrect.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her right-leaning political views and hawkish stance on security. Her leadership comes at a challenging time, as she must address a sluggish economy, unite a fractured party, and navigate a complex relationship with the United States. While her election is historic, some critics argue that her conservative positions on issues like same-sex marriage and women keeping their maiden names may limit her broader popular appeal.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at 'Premier Passions,' the groundbreaking 1998 BBC documentary that provided an unfiltered, behind-the-scenes view of Sunderland AFC's turbulent 1996-97 Premier League season. The series became famous for its raw depiction of dressing room dynamics, including manager Peter Reid's expletive-filled team talks, and chronicled the club's painful relegation and preparations to leave its historic Roker Park stadium. Former manager Reid and club officials reflect on the decision to allow unprecedented camera access, acknowledging that while it captured a difficult period, it also helped grow the club's profile. The documentary remains a memorable snapshot of English football during a period of significant commercial change.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons for the year. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, a time traditionally associated with farmers gathering crops. Skygazers in the UK can see it rise around 18:20 GMT, though cloudy weather may obstruct the view in some areas.</p>
