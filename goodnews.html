        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the upcoming July deadlines for reimposing tariffs on imports from numerous countries. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the deadlines are "not critical," suggesting extensions are possible for nations engaged in good faith negotiations. This potential delay aims to provide more time to finalize trade agreements, of which only two frameworks with China and the UK have been established so far. The remarks provided a temporary boost to stock markets, signaling a less rigid approach to the administration's trade policy.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in fashion for over three decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue. While she will continue in her broader roles as Vogue's global editorial director and Cond√© Nast's chief content officer, the U.S. publication will hire a new head of editorial content. This structural change, announced by the 75-year-old magnate, aligns the U.S. edition with other global Vogue markets. Wintour's move allows her to focus on her global and corporate responsibilities, marking a significant transition for the iconic magazine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent gradual rise, interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) could potentially decrease during the summer based on key economic events. The article identifies three dates that could trigger a drop: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A decline in inflation or a formal rate cut by the Fed could lead to lower HELOC rates for borrowers. The analysis suggests homeowners should monitor these dates for potential relief in borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Signs installed in U.S. national parks asking visitors to report "negative" information about American history have elicited public feedback, but not in the way the administration intended. The initiative stems from a Trump executive order to remove content that "inappropriately disparages Americans." However, a review of submitted comments shows visitors are largely pushing back, with many stating that a full and honest account of history, including difficult aspects, is necessary. Critics of the initiative also raise concerns that the open feedback system could be manipulated by ideologically motivated groups.</p>

However, a 9-month CD would earn slightly less than a savings account at current rates.

          <p>While many debt management programs are legitimate, borrowers overwhelmed by debt should watch for several warning signs to avoid predatory schemes. Red flags include companies that guarantee specific results, demand large upfront fees before providing services, or refuse to be transparent about their process and costs. A reputable credit counselor will conduct a thorough review of a person's entire financial situation and be honest about all available options and potential credit score impacts. Rushing into the wrong program can worsen a borrower's financial situation, making careful vetting essential.</p>
