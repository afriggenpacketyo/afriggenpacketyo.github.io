        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision keeps the law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, on hold while legal challenges proceed. The law had been criticized for conflicting with the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy and for its potential to impose harsh penalties, including mandatory jail time. Civil liberties groups have praised the court's denial as a reaffirmation of established legal principles.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team has won its first-ever T20 series in England, clinching the victory with a comfortable six-wicket win in the fourth match at Old Trafford. The Indian team successfully chased down England's modest total of 126-7, with openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma establishing a strong foundation. England's batting struggled against India's spin bowlers, a recurring issue in the series, setting up a dead rubber for the final match.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own specialized hardware, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs. This development was necessary because commercially available solutions were inadequate for the scale of AWS's operations, and building new liquid-cooled data centers would have been too slow. The custom hardware allows AWS to effectively deploy Nvidia's latest high-density computing systems, like the GB200 NVL72, within its existing infrastructure to meet the surging demand for AI workloads.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in technology stocks led by Nvidia. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency's price had been trading in a narrow range for weeks before this recent breakout. The rally demonstrates that Bitcoin, while seen by some as "digital gold," still often trades as a risk asset, moving in tandem with growth-oriented equities when market sentiment is bullish.
