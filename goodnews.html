          <h2>Starbucks Announces Fall Menu Return, Including Popular Pumpkin Spice Latte</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:04:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks has announced the highly anticipated return of its Pumpkin Spice Latte on August 26, 2025, accompanied by an expanded fall menu featuring new items like the Pecan Oatmilk Cortado and Italian Sausage Egg Bites. This strategic seasonal launch is critical for Starbucks, which is currently experiencing stalled growth and aims to boost sales and customer traffic. The iconic PSL, first introduced in 2003, has evolved into a significant cultural phenomenon and a consistent revenue driver, inspiring similar offerings across the industry. This initiative is part of CEO Brian Niccol's broader "Back to Starbucks" campaign, designed to re-engage consumers and improve financial performance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:02:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dottie Dorion, a remarkable 91-year-old athlete with over 2,900 Peloton rides and a history of 250 marathons, successfully championed a change at Peloton to introduce new age categories for seniors. Frustrated by competing solely within the 60-plus bracket, Dorion embarked on a 14-month campaign, even enlisting legal help, to advocate for riders aged 90 and above. Her unwavering persistence ultimately led Peloton to establish both 90-plus and 100-plus age groups. This achievement underscores the power of individual advocacy and promotes inclusivity for older adults in fitness communities.</p>

          <h2>New VaporID Air Scanner Poised to Revolutionize US Border Drug and Explosives Detection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking microwave-sized device named VaporID is set to transform U.S. border security, potentially superseding traditional drug-sniffing dogs. Developed by PNNL and commercialized by BaySpec, this portable air scanner rapidly detects substances like fentanyl, cocaine, and explosives within seconds, even at trace levels. Unlike canine units, VaporID offers consistent performance without fatigue and can be updated to identify new drug variants. Successful field trials at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing underscore its high accuracy and speed. This technology promises to significantly enhance efforts to combat illicit drug and explosive smuggling, offering a more efficient and reliable detection method.</p>

          <p>U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who perished alongside ten other American soldiers during a 1968 attack on Lima Site 85 in Laos amidst the Vietnam War, has finally been accounted for after 57 years. Hall's unit was trapped on a remote mountain peak following an assault by communist forces, with only a few men successfully rescued. Through persistent joint recovery operations conducted by the U.S. and Laos in subsequent decades, including recent efforts this year, his remains were identified using advanced anthropological and DNA analysis. Hall's family was informed of this significant development last month, bringing closure as he is scheduled for burial in September.</p>

Prosecutors revealed he also sought employment with UK Border Force as part of his scheme to aid Russia. He left a USB drive containing a document where he declared himself "invaluable" to a foreign power, offering "100% loyalty and dedication" for financial gain, demonstrating a significant threat to national security.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly deploying body heat sensor technology, such as the system developed by Butlr, an MIT Media Lab spin-off, to optimize office spaces for efficiency and hospitality. These privacy-preserving sensors anonymously monitor occupancy, foot traffic, meeting frequency, and environmental factors without using cameras. The collected data enables businesses to make informed decisions regarding office layout, renovations, hybrid work arrangements, and operational aspects like cleaning and maintenance. Amid rising office upgrade costs and a push for employees to return to physical workspaces, this technology offers critical insights into space utilization, aiming to foster more productive and collaborative work environments.</p>

          <p>The annual "funniest joke" award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, previously sponsored by U&Dave, has been discontinued for 2025. Organizers cited an evolving commissioning strategy and a desire to re-evaluate how best to support comedy. Initiated in 2008, the award was known for generating humorous headlines but also drew criticism for its bias towards one-liners, despite its original intent to highlight emerging comedic talent. While the festival's more esteemed Edinburgh comedy award for overall performance will continue, the cancellation of the "funniest joke" gong marks the end of a nearly two-decade tradition, which had only been interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he is scheduled to meet with Chinese officials in Sweden next week for the third round of high-level trade negotiations. These discussions are primarily aimed at securing an extension of the current pause on escalating tariffs beyond the mid-August deadline. Both Bessent and the Chinese embassy in Washington have expressed optimism about the talks, indicating that "new progress" has been achieved in addressing mutual economic and trade concerns. This development suggests a continued de-escalation of the trade tensions that began with President Trump's imposition of reciprocal tariffs earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Target is ending its 12-year-long policy of price matching against competitors Amazon and Walmart, effective July 28. Moving forward, customers will only be eligible for price adjustments if an identical item is found at a lower cost on Target's own platforms. The company justified this change by stating that guests predominantly price match Target's internal prices rather than external retailers. This strategic shift occurs as Target grapples with significant business headwinds, including declining sales and reduced store traffic, as indicated in its recent earnings report.

This broader shake-up, occurring eight months into Badenoch's leadership, aims to signal the party's "policy renewal program" and reinforce internal unity.
