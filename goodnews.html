          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 19:38:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, largely attributed to its massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While television ratings are recovering, they remain below their peak, but the show's online following has exploded, with short-form clips and fan-created content driving conversation. The article notes that many viewers now follow the show through social media recaps rather than watching the full daily episodes. This shift in consumption habits raises concerns about context, as character narratives are condensed into brief, potentially misleading clips.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and end a seven-game losing streak. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani set a dominant tone early in the game, striking out four batters and allowing only one hit before reaching his pitch limit. While reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's start provided the critical momentum the team needed. The outing demonstrated significant progress in his return from Tommy John surgery and highlighted his vital dual role for the struggling team.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often cited as a factor exacerbating China's population decline by reducing incentives for marriage and childbirth, some experts argue this may not be a negative trend. The article highlights the perspective of young professionals who feel less pressure to start families, believing AI will eventually fulfill roles like emotional companionship and elderly care. A demography expert suggests that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete. This technological shift could offer alternative solutions to societal needs.</p>

          <p>England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, has defended his team's use of delay tactics at the end of day three of the Test match against India at Lord's. England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game to ensure he and his partner would only have to face one over before the close, angering Indian players. Southee pointed out India's own time-wasting earlier in the match, including captain Shubman Gill receiving a massage on the field, suggesting both sides were engaging in gamesmanship.
