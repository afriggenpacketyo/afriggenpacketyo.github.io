          <p>Qualcomm has unveiled its Snapdragon Ride Pilot Automated Driving System, developed in collaboration with BMW, signaling a significant diversification for the chip giant into the automotive sector. This driver-assist feature enables hands-free driving and lane changes on specific roads, with plans for a global rollout across 100 countries by 2026, debuting in the new BMW iX3. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon anticipates a “domino effect” as other carmakers witness the system’s performance, leading to wider licensing. The company is actively pursuing partnerships, aiming to grow its automotive revenue to $8 billion by fiscal year 2029 through integrated solutions and ecosystem building.</p>

          <p>WCMX, or wheelchair motocross, is rapidly growing in popularity, particularly online, with athletes like Tomas Woods sharing their tricks and travels. Described as "BMX in a wheelchair," the sport involves performing stunts over 90 seconds, similar to skateboarding. Its global community is expanding, with the World Championships returning to Europe this month. Organizers are now aiming for WCMX to be included in the Paralympics by Brisbane 2032, with hopes for a test event at LA 2028. However, challenges remain, including the high cost of specialist wheelchairs and limited access to suitable skateparks in some regions.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher as investors evaluate the latest inflation figures and trade news. Futures for the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB all indicate an upward trend. This comes as markets process overnight reports of US President Donald Trump urging the EU to impose substantial tariffs on China and India over their Russian oil purchases, aiming to intensify pressure on Moscow. Attention also focuses on China's August inflation data, which showed consumer prices falling more than anticipated, and upcoming US producer and consumer price index releases, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on a potential rate cut next week.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite winning only two Premier League games since April, statistical analysis suggests Manchester United's underlying performances have been better than their results indicate. The article highlights that United has taken the most shots and faced the fewest shots among 17 ever-present teams in their last 10 games, second only to Manchester City in restricting opposition chances. The primary issue lies in inefficiency in both scoring and saving goals, with the team scoring seven fewer and conceding four more than historically expected from their chances. While tactical choices under Ruben Amorim are considered, a lack of confidence or bad luck are also potential factors for this underperformance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary court ruling blocking President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Trump sought to remove Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, citing alleged mortgage fraud, a move widely seen as an effort to undermine the Fed's independence. US District Judge Jia Cobb found that Trump had not identified sufficient grounds related to Cook's conduct or job performance as a Board member to warrant her dismissal. This ruling allows Cook to continue in her role while her lawsuit proceeds, safeguarding the central bank's independence from political interference, a critical factor for market confidence.</p>

          <p>Ford has initiated a new global advertising campaign, "Ready, Set, Ford," marking a fundamental shift in its branding strategy.

This launch comes amidst significant industry disruption, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and a consumer spending pullback. Ford's Chief Marketing Officer, Lisa Materazzo, emphasized the intentional timing, leveraging the company's 122-year history and American roots to navigate uncertainty. The campaign aims to unify Ford's global brands, with most markets adopting it by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a pioneering chlamydia vaccine for rollout, offering a critical tool to combat the epidemic devastating wild koala populations across eastern Australia. Scientists from the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing this single-dose jab, which has shown to reduce the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia causes severe health issues, including blindness and infertility, and its treatment with antibiotics can be fatal for koalas. While a major breakthrough, researchers emphasize that the vaccine alone is insufficient, stressing the continued importance of addressing habitat loss and other threats to the species.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) delivered a confident 2-0 victory over a rotated Japan side, with goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun. This improved performance lends credence to coach Mauricio Pochettino's strategy of using recent games for player evaluation ahead of the World Cup. The USMNT deployed a 3-4-2-1 formation, providing opportunities for less-frequent starters to showcase their potential contributions. While the team showed greater comfort and sustained pressure, some areas, like goalkeeper confidence and clinical finishing, still require refinement. The article suggests this win indicates a growing comfort and capability within the team.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, including the relaunching of inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, mediated by Egypt's Foreign Minister, was described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as a "step in the right direction" and technical in nature, emphasizing the indispensable role of inspections under the non-proliferation treaty. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the deal addresses his country's concerns but warned it would be terminated if UN sanctions are reimposed. This framework emerges at a sensitive time, following new sanctions threats from Germany, France, and the UK, who accuse Iran of non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Greater Bay Area is an ideal candidate to host the 2036 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, presenting a compelling case for its selection. The author highlights the region's existing world-class sports facilities, such as the Universiade Sports Complex in Shenzhen and the Olympic Sports Centre in Macau, which are already equipped for major events. Furthermore, Hong Kong's iconic harbor could serve as a scenic backdrop for temporary venues for sports like triathlon and beach volleyball, minimizing the need for costly new permanent infrastructure. The article emphasizes the Greater Bay Area's robust and expanding transport network, which could easily meet the Olympic committee's requirement for athletes to be housed within 45 minutes of their competition venues.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered a strong rehab start for triple-A Oklahoma City, topping 100 mph multiple times in four shutout innings. This performance has brought him back into contention for a spot on the Dodgers’ postseason pitching staff. Sasaki, who had been on the injured list since mid-May with a shoulder impingement, previously struggled in earlier rehab appearances. While a rotation spot is unlikely, he could potentially contribute from the bullpen. Manager Dave Roberts noted the increasing difficulty of roster decisions as the regular season nears its end, highlighting Sasaki's talent and desire to contribute.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win a special election for a Northern Virginia congressional district, further narrowing the House GOP's majority to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor and former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson. The district, reliably Democratic, saw the issue of federal job cuts under President Trump as a dominant factor, affecting a significant portion of the community. Walkinshaw has also pledged to sign a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, an issue with bipartisan support among voters. This victory highlights a continuing trend of Democratic overperformance in recent races.</p>
