          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly earnings since going public, causing its stock to rise. The growth was primarily fueled by the strong performance of its USD Coin (USDC), the world's second-largest stablecoin. Despite the revenue jump, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, largely due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, including stock-based compensation and debt value adjustments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25-year study from Northwestern University has explored why "super agers"—individuals over 80 with the memory capacity of people decades younger—maintain their cognitive sharpness. Researchers found these individuals exhibit distinct brain characteristics, including a thicker cortex and more von Economo neurons, which are linked to social behavior. The study suggests two pathways: some brains resist the formation of toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer's, while others show resilience by having these proteins without suffering cognitive effects. This research challenges the assumption that significant memory loss is an inevitable part of aging.</p>

          <p>Tesla has begun accepting orders in China for a new, longer-range version of its Model 3 electric vehicle, priced at a 14% premium over the basic edition. The new variant boasts an extended driving range of 830km, featuring a high-performance battery from LG Energy Solution and a more powerful single motor. This launch comes as Tesla faces intensified competition and a recent decline in its mainland China deliveries. The company's Shanghai Gigafactory saw an 8.4% year-over-year drop in deliveries for July, reflecting the challenging market dynamics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate dropped to 1.55% in July, marking the ninth consecutive month of decline and reaching its lowest level since June 2017. The decrease was largely driven by falling food prices, with the reading coming in below economists' expectations. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room to loosen monetary policy to support economic growth. The positive inflation outlook contrasts with economic headwinds from U.S. trade tensions, as India faces significant tariffs over its oil purchases from Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing signs of cooling as official data reveals a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000 between May and July, the lowest level since early 2021. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest decline for the tenth time in the last twelve months. Despite these trends, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual slowdown rather than a sharp downturn. Economists note the cooling may be a calming effect following recent increases in business taxes and the national minimum wage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska brings to light the state's deep historical ties to Russia, which colonized the territory in the 18th century. Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million after the costly Crimean War left its empire financially strained and the region's fur trade had declined. The deal, initially mocked in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," was seen by Russia as a pragmatic way to raise funds and avoid conflict with Britain. The historical transaction provides a unique backdrop to the modern diplomatic meeting.</p>

          <p>A Brooklyn man has pleaded guilty to smuggling approximately 850 protected turtles, valued at over $1.4 million, from the United States to Hong Kong. The man, Wei Qiang Lin, shipped the live eastern box and three-toed box turtles in parcels deceptively labeled as "plastic animal toys," with the reptiles wrapped inside socks. These turtles are protected under the CITES international treaty and are highly prized in the foreign pet market. Lin faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for the federal crime.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have shut down an organization that was allegedly running "spiritual retreats" offering dangerous substances, including the hallucinogenic drugs ayahuasca and San Pedro cactus, as well as Kambo, a toxic frog venom. The group operated from a villa, charging clients over $1,160 for multi-day stays that promised mystical experiences but lacked medical safety measures. The investigation began after a victim filed a complaint, leading to the arrest of three leaders and the seizure of drugs and cash. Authorities warn that these substances can have unpredictable and dangerous effects.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old springer spaniel named Maple, who retired from police work after an injury, has been trained to detect a deadly disease in honeybees. Working with Michigan State University researchers, Maple uses her detection skills to identify American foulbrood, a bacterial disease that kills bee larvae and can devastate entire colonies. This work is crucial for beekeepers and for protecting pollinators, which are in decline globally. Dressed in a custom protective bee suit, Maple's new career not only aids important scientific research but has also given the high-energy dog a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>A summer leadership program in Southern California is teaching children from immigrant families about civic engagement, a lesson that has taken on new urgency amid recent immigration enforcement raids. The program, run by the legal center TODEC, helps kids understand how to create change, with many participants motivated by the fear and disruption they see in their communities. During a mock city council meeting, the children voted to fund mental health workshops to address the emotional toll of the raids. The initiative aims to empower a generation confronting the realities of family separation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against calls for Los Angeles to withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympic Games, asserting that the city's history of successful hosting is too meaningful to abandon over political disagreements. The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent cordial meeting with President Trump as a necessary act of diplomacy to ensure the Games' success. The article recalls the triumphs of the 1932 and 1984 L.A. Olympics, which both produced significant profits and civic pride. The focus, it argues, should remain on the athletes and the city's ability to host a world-class event.</p>

Her alias, created a decade ago, merges her "princess-like" and "darker" sides, providing a vehicle for her creative projects in modeling, art, and business. Now in a more refined phase of life, her style reflects a comfortable evolution of her established aesthetic.</p>
