          <p>A new LendingTree study reveals that Americans spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips in 2023, with tipping rates varying significantly by state. New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. The study also indicates that higher tipping rates correlate with states where people dine out more frequently, with Washington D.C. residents spending the most on dining out, at $10,291 per capita in 2023, and the East Coast generally exhibiting higher tipping rates than the South and Western U.S.</p>

          <p>NASA and Axiom Space have indefinitely delayed the launch of the Axiom-4 commercial flight to the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns about a persistent air leak in a Russian compartment. The leak, located in the PrK, a passageway in the Zvezda module, was first detected in 2019, and although cosmonauts have attempted to seal it, air continues to escape. The delay allows NASA and Roscosmos additional time to evaluate the situation and determine if further troubleshooting is necessary, with the hatch to the PrK closed during daily operations as a precautionary measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive inflation higher, recent data has not shown significant price increases. Factors such as companies stockpiling imported goods, the time it takes for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power have kept inflation in check. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, as the effects of pre-tariff stockpiling diminish and higher import costs begin to affect consumer prices.

          <p>An unexpected surge in Social Security retirement claims occurred between January and May, nearly 18% higher than the same period last year, raising concerns about the financial implications for individuals. The Social Security Administration cited retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and a bump in people re-filing for higher benefits as key reasons. Additionally, worries about the economic future under the Trump administration are prompting some individuals in their 60s to claim benefits early, fearing potential changes to the system and a desire to secure benefits while they are available.

          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back his proposed "reciprocal" tariffs on goods from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. The survey, conducted by AlixPartners, found that executives anticipate tariffs on goods from Vietnam to remain at 10% rather than the feared 46% level. The optimism stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs, although some caution that the situation remains uncertain, particularly for countries without China's leverage.
