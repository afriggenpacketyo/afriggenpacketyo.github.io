        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that corporate-level mergers are not subject to asset-level rights of refusal. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some headcount reductions as part of ongoing efficiency efforts.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Decrease to Pre-Tariff Levels, Michigan Survey Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's July consumer survey indicates a significant drop in inflation fears, with expectations returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook fell to 4.4% from 5%, while the five-year forecast slid to 3.6%. Despite this decline, survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the figures remain above late 2024 levels. The overall consumer sentiment index saw a slight increase, aligning with market estimates and reaching its highest point since February. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer returns that can outpace inflation, making them an attractive and safe option for savers. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.03% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms reaching 4.40% APY. To secure the best rates, experts advise looking at online banks, which have lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options. Laddering CDs of various terms is also a recommended strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging housing market with high rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still find viable options. As of mid-July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.70%, while a 15-year loan averages around 5.88%. To secure the best possible rate, experts recommend strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and shopping around with multiple lenders. Borrowers should also consider loan terms and associated fees, as these factors significantly impact the total cost of the loan over its lifetime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their pro-Palestinian comments at the Glastonbury festival. The force stated there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence." The group, which had faced controversy and calls for their U.S. visas to be revoked, described the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation." The decision to even allow the group to perform at the festival had drawn high-level political commentary.</p>

          <h2>Investors Weigh Switching to Silver as Its Price Surges Alongside Gold</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:00:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of silver has surged to over $38 per ounce, its highest point in over a decade, prompting some investors to consider it as a more affordable alternative to gold. Like gold, silver can serve as a hedge against inflation and a tool for portfolio diversification, but at a fraction of the cost. However, experts caution against a complete switch from gold to silver, as gold remains the historically more valuable asset. Instead, the current market presents an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations, which should generally not exceed 10% of an overall portfolio.

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated that Chinese-funded manufacturing operations in Mexico are "very unlikely" to be excluded from the preferential trade benefits of the USMCA pact. The trade deal is scheduled for review next year, raising questions about how Chinese investment will be treated amid U.S.-China rivalry. David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor at the Mexican Embassy in China, suggested that any revisions to the agreement would likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting companies from specific nations. This would mean products need a higher percentage of locally-made content to qualify for benefits.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts offer a secure way to grow an emergency fund, with top rates significantly outpacing the national average of 0.38% APY. As of July 2025, leading online banks are providing rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, allowing savings to grow substantially faster than in traditional accounts. Experts recommend choosing online banks for their higher rates and lower fees, which are made possible by their reduced overhead costs. Comparing different accounts is crucial to find the best combination of high interest, minimal fees, and user-friendly features to maximize savings growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first known criminal conviction tied to the Post Office's Capture accounting system, a precursor to the notorious Horizon software, has been referred to the Court of Appeal. The case involves Patricia Owen, a former sub-postmistress convicted of theft in 1998, with the referral made on the grounds that her prosecution was an abuse of process. This marks a significant development in the broader Post Office scandal, extending scrutiny beyond the Horizon system. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is examining 27 other cases to see if the Capture software played a role in wrongful convictions.</p>

          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's content like "Bluey" and "CoComelon" is emerging as a crucial tool for customer retention and profitability. This programming is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce subscriber churn—a major challenge for services like Netflix and Disney+. Media companies are finding that while live sports and hit series attract new subscribers, a strong library of kids' content gives families a reason to maintain their subscriptions long-term. This strategy also involves leveraging YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to drive discovery and engagement.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults. The diagnosis came after the president noticed swelling in his legs, prompting an examination. According to his physician, the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool, but it is considered benign. The doctor's note confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure, and stated that the president "remains in excellent health."</p>
