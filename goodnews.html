          <p>While installing pipes in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child, marking the latest in a series of pre-Hispanic tomb discoveries in the capital. The mummy, believed to be a boy between 10 and 15 years old, was found in a sitting position with arms and legs bent, wrapped in a shroud containing calabash gourds. The burial and associated ceramic objects, including plates and jugs decorated with geometric figures and fishermen, are attributed to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which inhabited the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries. Utility companies in Peru are required to hire archaeologists during excavation work due to the high probability of encountering heritage sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, with a central component being lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms, while about 500 of the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut by up to 90% from 2026. The plan also includes measures to expedite grid connections for new factories, upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on eight specific sectors. Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticized the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices".</p>

          <p>Aaron Wolf, the Tokyo Olympic judo gold medalist, announced his retirement from judo and his transition to professional wrestling, joining New Japan Pro Wrestling. Wolf, who won gold in the men's 100-kilogram judo event at the 2021 Olympics and finished seventh at the Paris Games, is scheduled to make his debut at Tokyo Dome in January. A longtime fan of professional wrestling, Wolf decided to make the switch after last summer's Olympics, citing his desire to challenge himself on a new stage. He follows in the footsteps of other judokas who have transitioned to combat sports, including Naoya Ogawa, Hidehiko Yoshida, and Satoshi Ishii.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 06:06:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethics of enforcing academic rules against AI-generated writing, as students increasingly view it as a legitimate tool. The dilemma highlights a conflict between the traditional, transformative purpose of humanities education and the modern, product-based vision, which AI exposes as a sham. The author argues that the real value of humanities lies in character cultivation, particularly practical wisdom (phronesis), which involves making sound judgments in complex situations. Rather than strictly banning AI, the author suggests allowing its use but requiring students to reflect on how it alters their thinking and learning, thus reintroducing cognitive friction and fostering critical reasoning skills.</p>

Cruz acknowledged the loss of Brooks but lauded Durant as an "absolute beast," deeming the trade "GREAT." Durant, despite being 36, remains a top scorer, averaging 26.6 points per game with a 52.7% shooting percentage. The Rockets have also reportedly extended head coach Ime Udoka following their second-place finish in the Western Conference, signaling a busy offseason for the team.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that a majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for limited-English proficient voters, potentially increasing voter turnout. The survey, conducted in multiple languages, found that 70% of registered voters agreed that translated ballots should be provided, with strong support across demographics, although Republicans were closely divided. The finding highlights the importance of inclusivity in a state where over a quarter of residents are foreign-born, and more than 3 million registered voters self-identify as limited-English proficient. While state and federal laws mandate bilingual voting assistance for Spanish speakers, efforts to expand language access to other communities have faced challenges.</p>

          <p>Okinawa commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a fierce WWII ground battle between Japan and the United States, with a ceremony at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki pledged to preserve and pass on the lessons of history amid rising global tensions. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the reality of the battle and its lessons as the roots of the people of Okinawa and their enduring desire for peace. Ishiba pledged to visibly reduce the burden of U.S. bases in Okinawa, acknowledging the long-standing resentment over noise, pollution, and crimes by U.S. troops.</p>
