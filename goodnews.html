          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back from El Salvador. Federal prosecutors allege he conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including children, from Mexico and Central America for thousands of dollars. The case has been marked by legal battles, including his deportation to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring it. Prosecutors argue Abrego Garcia is a flight risk due to alleged MS-13 ties, while his attorneys claim the government's arguments for detention are meritless and that there is no evidence he will obstruct justice.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns over tariffs and inflation have lessened. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed significant increases in the headline index, current conditions, and future expectations. This improvement coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs and progress in trade negotiations. Despite the rebound, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago readings, reflecting ongoing worries about the economic impact of trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has taken a firm stance against President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles following immigration raids. Newsom condemned the "brazen abuse of power" and emphasized that California does not want its streets militarized by federal forces. His clear and direct response positions him as a key figure in resisting the administration's policies and defending the state's autonomy. The situation underscores the escalating tensions between California and the federal government over immigration and civil rights.</p>

          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing significant distress for hay fever sufferers. The warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major trigger for allergies. Allergy experts recommend a "cocktail approach" using antihistamines, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops to manage symptoms. Additionally, avoiding triggers, practicing good hygiene, and keeping pets clean can help reduce the severity of hay fever.</p>
