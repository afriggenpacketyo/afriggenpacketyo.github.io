          <p>Costco surpassed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue, demonstrating robust growth in both membership income and e-commerce. The warehouse club is effectively appealing to younger demographics, with nearly half of its new members under 40, which has bolstered its overall revenue. CFO Gary Millerchip noted efforts to mitigate higher tariff costs by diversifying merchandise and introducing Kirkland Signature alternatives. While shares saw a slight dip in extended trading and have underperformed the S&P 500 recently, Costco plans significant expansion with 35 new warehouses in the upcoming fiscal year, indicating confidence in future growth.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will guide its policy trajectory for the remainder of the decade, amid domestic economic shifts and global uncertainties. Analysts anticipate a strong focus on enhancing the resilience and sophistication of its manufacturing ecosystem, particularly by addressing weak links in high-tech supply chains. While some products, like US-bound iPhones, are assembled elsewhere, their core components often still rely on China's extensive supply network. The plan aims to propel China further up the global value chain, cementing its position as a dominant and self-sufficient manufacturing powerhouse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a groundbreaking $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action copyright lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic, brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally utilized books from pirated databases to train its AI systems. This historic agreement, which includes compensation of approximately $3,000 per book and the mandated destruction of the infringing datasets, represents the largest publicly reported copyright recovery to date. The settlement establishes a significant precedent for AI companies concerning intellectual property, allowing Anthropic to concentrate on developing safe AI systems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has formally approved a deal for a consortium of US investors, including Oracle and Rupert Murdoch, to take control of TikTok's US operations, thereby preventing a ban. This agreement, valued at $14 billion, ensures that American investors will control the app's crucial algorithm and hold a majority of board seats, with ByteDance retaining less than 20% ownership. The divestiture aims to alleviate national security concerns about potential Chinese government access to user data and influence over content. The new US entity will retrain its algorithm on American user data, with security partners overseeing updates and data flows, ensuring continued operation for 170 million US users.</p>

          <p>Brooks Nader, known for her modeling career, shared insights into her path from an 'extremely Christian and conservative' upbringing in Baton Rouge to achieving her big-city dreams. Despite her parents' initial disapproval of her aspirations, Nader took a leap of faith, moving to New York and pursuing a finance internship while secretly connecting with a modeling agent. She later dropped out of college, against her family's wishes, to fully commit to her passion. Nader famously secured her spot in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue through an open-call audition after her agency dismissed her chances, eventually gracing the cover.

The article posits that China's economy is built upon a robust foundation characterized by significant investments in green infrastructure, advanced digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. This synergistic approach, it argues, is fostering a wave of sustainable, high-quality development, moving China towards a more diversified economic model. The article highlights China's current global leadership in scientific research, contributing over a third of highly cited papers and excelling in 57 out of 64 key technologies, including AI and renewable energy.</p>

US captain Keegan Bradley praised DeChambeau's 'X-Factor ability' and 'fiery' presence, acknowledging his significant efforts in team bonding.

          <p>Amazon has reached a significant $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, resolving allegations that the company used deceptive practices to enroll customers in its Prime membership and obstructed their attempts to cancel. The agreement, finalized early in a federal trial, comprises a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds for approximately 35 million customers affected by unwanted enrollments or deferred cancellations. Although Amazon maintains it committed no wrongdoing, the settlement mandates clear disclosures during Prime enrollment and a simplified cancellation process, many aspects of which the company asserts were already in place. This substantial penalty is among the largest imposed by the FTC, though Amazon still faces a broader antitrust lawsuit in 2027.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales are experiencing an unexpected boost, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 forecast to 16.1 million units, up from previous estimates. This surge is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices, particularly following President Trump's tariff announcements and the upcoming expiration of EV tax credits. While this 'pull-ahead' demand has benefited the auto industry, analysts predict a slowdown in sales for the fourth quarter and into next year. General Motors, Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford have gained market share, while smaller brands like Nissan and Tesla have seen declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Jillian Lauren, married to Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, has been granted mental health diversion, allowing her to avoid jail time for an incident where she shot at LAPD officers. The event occurred when police, pursuing hit-and-run suspects, entered her backyard. Lauren, who was armed and wounded when officers returned fire, allegedly ignored commands, though a neighbor reported her confusion to 911. The judge's decision requires Lauren to abstain from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and attend therapy for two years, after which all charges will be dismissed. Prosecutors did not object to the diversion, recognizing the role of mental health issues in the incident.</p>
