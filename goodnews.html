          <h2>Bipartisan "Faith in Housing Act" Aims to Override Local Zoning for Affordable Housing on Religious Land</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing national movement known as "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) is pushing for legislation to allow religious institutions to build affordable housing on their property, bypassing restrictive local zoning laws. A new bipartisan bill in Congress, the Faith in Housing Act, seeks to enable this on a federal level, requiring new developments to serve low-income families. While the concept has seen success in states like California, it has faced significant opposition elsewhere from local governments concerned about losing control over zoning. Proponents argue it's a win-win, addressing the housing crisis while providing financial stability for religious organizations with declining membership.</p>

          <p>A London court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge "unlawful" because it lacked the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence his advocacy for Gaza, a sentiment echoed by First Minister Michelle O'Neill.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal increase in both flu and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to understand the differences between the two respiratory viruses. While both share symptoms, flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, whereas COVID-19's symptoms have evolved to often include cold-like signs such as a hoarse or sore throat. Health agencies report a recent rise in coronavirus cases and emphasize that both illnesses can be serious, particularly for vulnerable populations. Officials are strongly encouraging eligible individuals to receive both the flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines to reduce severe illness and hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition has made a remarkable discovery in Germany's Luebeck Bay, finding dense ecosystems of marine life flourishing on unexploded Nazi-era bombs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. An unmanned submersible captured footage of about 10 V-1 cruise missiles covered in creatures, including marine worms, mussels, and fish. In a particularly surprising observation, researchers saw over 40 starfish gathered directly on an exposed block of TNT, a highly toxic explosive. This moment demonstrates nature's resilience and ability to adapt, turning deadly remnants of war into vital hard surfaces that support biodiversity in an area where natural rock habitats have been depleted.</p>

          <p>A major sting operation coordinated by Interpol has led to the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in large-scale cybercrime across 14 African countries. The operation targeted criminal networks engaged in romance scams and "sextortion," where victims are blackmailed with explicit images. Authorities identified over 1,400 victims who lost a combined total of nearly $2.8 million. The crackdown, which took place between July and August, also resulted in the seizure of numerous devices and the dismantling of 81 cyber-crime groups. Officials noted a sharp rise in such digitally-enabled crimes, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to victims.</p>

          <h2>NYC Mayoral Candidate's Proposal for City-Owned Grocery Stores Faces Scrutiny Amid Mixed National Results</h2>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is championing a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores designed to keep food prices low by operating on a non-profit basis. The idea has found support among a majority of likely voters, but it faces strong criticism from private-sector grocers who question its viability. While the concept is not new, its track record across the U.S. is mixed. For example, a municipal supermarket has been a success in the small town of St. Paul, Kansas, but a similar experiment in nearby Erie, Kansas, failed after years of financial losses, highlighting the challenges of public-sector retail operations.

          <h2>Medical Experts Clarify Nuances of Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy Following Trump's Remarks</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's comments linking Tylenol to autism, medical experts and researchers are clarifying the current scientific understanding of acetaminophen use during pregnancy. While some studies suggest a potential association, particularly with chronic use, a causal link has not been established, and acetaminophen remains the safest option for treating fever, which itself poses significant risks to a fetus. The consensus among physicians is for judicious use at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, under a doctor's guidance. They stress that the benefits of treating a high fever or severe pain often outweigh the potential and unproven risks of the medication.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently tracking over the Atlantic, and while not expected to make landfall, it could interact with another developing storm system nearby. This interaction could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms become entangled and rotate around a common center. The outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; if comparable, they might "dance" around each other before separating, but more often the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one. While an interaction between Humberto and the second system is considered unlikely, it remains a possibility that forecasters are closely watching.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NFL game in Dublin between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings holds special significance as a homecoming for the Steelers' founding Rooney family. Art Rooney, who founded the team in 1933, was the great-grandson of Irish immigrants who fled the Great Famine. His son, the late Dan Rooney, was a pivotal figure in the NFL and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, fostering deep connections with the country. The game at Croke Park is seen as more than just football, celebrating the deep cultural ties between Ireland and the one in ten Americans of Irish heritage, including many players and executives.</p>

          <p>An ash tree located on a busy street in Glasgow has won the Woodland Trust's Tree of the Year 2025 competition after a public vote. The Argyle Street Ash, nominated as a wildcard entry, is a beloved local landmark with deep cultural roots, even being referenced in a 1951 book about the city. It triumphed over nine other contenders, including an oak that may have inspired a Radiohead album. The win is being celebrated as a victory for urban trees, which often face threats despite their importance to communities. The Glasgow ash will now go on to represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest in 2026.</p>
