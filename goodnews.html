          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's reported quarterly earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by increased demand for home projects. To further attract professional contractors, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor of interior building products, for $8.8 billion. While sales to do-it-yourself customers showed improvement, CEO Marvin Ellison noted that the market for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates. The acquisition is a strategic move to position Lowe's for growth when the housing market eventually recovers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, with annual recurring revenue now at $10 billion. Despite this rapid financial growth, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs and processing power to train and run its AI models. To address this, OpenAI is pursuing major infrastructure projects and diversifying its partners beyond Microsoft to include Oracle and Coreweave. This highlights the immense operational costs and infrastructure challenges associated with scaling advanced artificial intelligence systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a nutritional supplement for honeybees that could help them survive threats like climate change and habitat loss. The "superfood" contains all the necessary nutrients bees typically get from pollen, including specific lipids called sterols that were previously difficult to manufacture. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement saw up to a 15-fold increase in the number of young bees surviving to adulthood. This breakthrough could provide a vital lifeline for honeybees, which are essential for pollinating a majority of global food crops.</p>

          <p>Disney is rolling out a massive advertising campaign to support the launch of ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming app, which will be available without a cable subscription for $29.99 a month. The marketing push will heavily target Los Angeles and New York, utilizing billboards, wrapped vehicles, and takeovers of public transit spaces to saturate the two largest media markets. This strategic launch is a direct response to the decline in cable subscriptions, which has impacted ESPN's revenue. The new app aims to capture the growing number of "cord-cutter" sports fans by making ESPN's content accessible anywhere.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Western countries, including France, Britain, Canada, and Australia, are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This move is a significant diplomatic step intended to bolster the two-state solution, even without an active peace process. The recognition would support the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, thereby weakening its rival, Hamas. It also serves as a rebuke to Israel's expansion of settlements in the West Bank, which threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage in nearly 90 years of tracking. This decline is accompanied by a growing public belief that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, a view now held by a record 53% of adults, up from 28% in 2015. The shift in perception is most pronounced among young adults but is also increasing among older age groups. The findings suggest that years of public health information linking alcohol to risks like cancer are influencing American habits and attitudes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually leads to a corresponding drop in the HELOC interest rate. However, the timing of payment relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule and the loan's specific terms, such as introductory rates or interest rate floors. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan agreements and budget for potential rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates this fall will be heavily influenced by several key economic factors, starting with the Federal Reserve's future policy decisions. While the Fed's direct rate changes don't set mortgage rates, its forward-looking commentary and projections strongly guide the market. Critical data on inflation and the labor market will shape the Fed's stance, with cooling inflation and a slowing job market potentially leading to lower rates. Additionally, investor activity in mortgage-backed securities and broader geopolitical events that impact the economy will play a significant role. (not investment advice)</p>
