          <p>In Yellowstone National Park, a rare encounter was filmed showing a wolf pack successfully driving a grizzly bear away from a bison carcass. While a lone grizzly can typically dominate one or two wolves, the footage illustrates the effectiveness of teamwork when an entire pack is involved. The wolves, some with research collars, from the 8 Mile Pack, persistently nipped at the bear, confusing it and preventing it from going on the offensive. The article concludes with a wolf feasting on the meat, highlighting the dynamics of nature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" is misleading, according to a DW fact check. While the data from World Population Review shows high UK figures, the source itself cautions against cross-national comparisons due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys over police reports for more accurate prevalence data, as official statistics only capture reported incidents. Claims linking immigration to higher sexual assault rates are also deemed false by evidence.</p>

The public fascination stems from the fantasy and thrill the story offers, with some commentators noting the appeal of a heist story over more tragic news.

          <p>Passive investing via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) may be losing its appeal, despite record stock market highs. Financial experts note investors are seeking diversification beyond market indexes, as technology now comprises over 35% of the S&P 500, leading to an imbalance. Defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. This shift is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, such as the Russell 2000, which has recently outperformed the S&P 500. Next week, "Magnificent 7" tech giants are set to report earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
