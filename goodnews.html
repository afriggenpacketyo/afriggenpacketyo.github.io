          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have been disrupted due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, affecting services until 14:00. Passengers are advised to use alternative east coast rail services or seek refunds. Network Rail Scotland stated that repairs to the damaged lines near Beattock are underway, with the line expected to reopen around 11:30.</p>

          <p>A primary school in east London has ordered pupils to stay indoors after a buzzard nested in the playground and began dive-bombing residents. Dame Tipping Primary School in Havering-atte-Bower is concerned that the bird, nicknamed "Brenda" by the pupils, is guarding its nest and may attack children. Havering Council has advised the school to use legal deterrents or hire a falconry expert, but as buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited. The school is educating children about the buzzard, incorporating it into art and writing lessons, and is trying to allow outdoor play where possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Red Bull ordered Max Verstappen to cede his fourth-place position after an incident with George Russell in Turn One, believing a penalty was imminent. However, stewards later ruled that Russell had lost control and collided with Verstappen, who did not deliberately leave the track, negating the need for a penalty. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted that with hindsight, the decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake, stating they should have left him out on his soft tires. Horner noted the difficulty in making subjective calls without clear direction from race control.</p>

          <p>English amateur Tyler Weaver has qualified for his US Open debut after securing a qualifying spot, while PGA Tour players Rickie Fowler and Max Homa failed to qualify. Weaver tied for third at 11 under par in Atlanta, becoming one of three amateurs to qualify. Matt Wallace, another English player, qualified in Ontario, while Erik van Rooyen finished first in Columbus, Ohio. Homa, who recently split from his caddie, carried his own bag for 38 holes but missed out in a play-off, and the US Open is set to take place at Oakmont in Pennsylvania from June 12-15.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, who lost to Yoon Suk Yeol in the 2022 election, currently holds a lead in opinion polling, and an electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate would set him up to be the country's next leader. Eurasia Group stated that Lee is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda in office, and Goldman Sachs noted that both Lee and Kim Moon Soo share similar goals but differ in their economic policy platforms. Regardless of the election outcome, the South Korean won is likely to appreciate against the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Springwatch program, filming in Derbyshire, has captured a short-eared owl for the first time in its 20-year history. The show, located at the National Trust-owned Longshaw Estate in the Peak District National Park, has set up around 30 cameras to monitor the estate's wildlife. Presenter Chris Packham described the owls as remarkable, noting their unsynchronized fledging. The cameras have also captured a long-eared owl, a family of European pied flycatchers, and redstarts. This year, the show also features hidden cameras in ordinary gardens in Sheffield, showcasing swifts, badgers, foxes, and hedgehogs.</p>
