          <p>Joe Bugner, a former heavyweight boxer renowned for his durability and technical skill, has passed away at the age of 75 in Australia. Throughout the 1970s, he was consistently ranked among the world's top heavyweights, famously going the distance in bouts against legends like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Born in Hungary, Bugner became a three-time European champion and also held the British and Commonwealth titles twice during his extensive 83-fight career. He later appeared in films and on television, leaving a lasting legacy in the sport of boxing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Exeter indicates that daily consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice could help reduce blood pressure in older adults. The research found that the juice alters the oral microbiome, increasing helpful bacteria while decreasing microbes linked to inflammation. Participants in their 60s and 70s who drank the juice showed a notable decrease in blood pressure, a change not observed in the placebo group. Medical experts note that the body converts nitrates from foods like beets and leafy greens into nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels and improve vascular health, a benefit that becomes more significant with age.</p>

          <p>A new documentary film, "The Haydn Expedition," explores the unique operational structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, an orchestra renowned for its democratic organization and financial independence. Founded in 1980 by music students, the ensemble allows its 41 musicians to have a say in all major decisions, from repertoire selection to the choice of conductor. This collaborative approach, which managing director Albert Schmitt says fosters deep identification and motivation, has propelled the orchestra to international acclaim under the artistic direction of Paavo Jarvi. The film showcases their interpretation of Joseph Haydn's work, connecting the composer's own journey to freedom with the orchestra's democratic spirit.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for the transfer of striker Nicolas Jackson in a deal worth over £70 million. The 24-year-old will initially move to the German club on a £14.3 million loan, which includes a mandatory purchase option for £56.2 million contingent on a minimum number of appearances. Jackson, who joined Chelsea in 2023, reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards during the season. To fill the gap in their attack, Chelsea has signed 20-year-old Argentine Facundo Buonanotte on a season-long loan from Brighton.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has secured a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, bolstering their defense on transfer deadline day. The 25-year-old is set to sign a long-term contract after completing a medical. The transfer follows concerns about Liverpool's defense after conceding six goals in their first three games of the season. This acquisition, along with the £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak, brings Liverpool's summer spending to a record-breaking total of approximately £451.2 million, making it only the second time an English club has surpassed the £400 million mark in a single transfer window.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively working to deepen its strategic partnership with India, focusing on expanding cooperation in trade, climate, and defense. With bilateral trade hitting a record $33 billion in 2024, German officials are visiting India to explore further opportunities, positioning the nation as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific. This push comes as both countries navigate global economic challenges, including U.S. trade tariffs and geopolitical instability. While bureaucratic hurdles in India remain a concern for German businesses, there is strong momentum to finalize an EU-India free trade agreement and collaborate on key sectors like renewable energy and labor mobility.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, financial and cybersecurity experts view the goal as unrealistic and potentially dangerous, given the country's current infrastructure and societal habits. Challenges include a high rate of economic informality, a large rural population reliant on cash, and significant vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, as evidenced by major cyberattacks in recent years. Many small businesses and older citizens remain unprepared for such a rapid transition, suggesting that a complete shift away from cash within the decade is highly improbable.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has revealed that European nations are developing "precise plans" for a multinational military deployment in Ukraine as part of post-war security guarantees. In an interview, she stated that President Trump has agreed to an American "presence" as a backstop for the force, which could be implemented if a peace agreement is reached. While the Trump administration has repeatedly said it will not send U.S. troops, it has suggested providing coordination and support. The planning reflects a high sense of urgency among Western allies to establish a framework that would prevent future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A solar eruption over the weekend is expected to create a vibrant display of the northern lights, potentially making them visible across 18 U.S. states and Canada on Monday night into early Tuesday. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, a coronal mass ejection will interact with Earth's magnetic field, generating the aurora borealis. The celestial event is forecasted to be visible in states as far south as Iowa and Illinois. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights and checking local weather forecasts for clear skies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy argues that prospective homeowners should opt for a 15-year mortgage, stating, "If you can't afford a 15-year mortgage, you can't really afford the home." She cautions that with a 30-year loan, a significant portion of early payments goes toward interest, building very little equity in the first several years. Joy also advises buyers to account for the numerous hidden costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, higher utility bills, and furnishing a larger space, which are often overlooked. She recommends that total living expenses, including the mortgage, should not exceed 50% of one's income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. In his post, Trump described the U.S.-India trade relationship as "one sided" and suggested the offer should have been made years ago. This claim comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, showing solidarity with Chinese and Russian leaders amid trade pressure from Washington. The potential tariff reduction follows the Trump administration's implementation of duties as high as 50% on certain Indian goods, which has strained the economic relationship between the two nations.

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has named his six wildcard picks, creating the least-changed team in the event's modern history. Shane Lowry, Jon Rahm, Sepp Straka, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Aberg, and Matt Fitzpatrick will join the six automatic qualifiers, meaning only one player is new from the victorious 2023 Rome squad. Donald has opted for experience to face the challenge of playing an away match at Bethpage Black in New York, a historically difficult feat for European teams. The continuity reflects the strength of the previous team, but Donald acknowledged the unique pressure of competing on U.S. soil.</p>
