          <p>Radio personality Howard Stern has confirmed he is in ongoing discussions with SiriusXM for a new contract, dispelling rumors of his departure. The clarification came after an on-air prank where fellow host Andy Cohen pretended to take over Stern's show, leading some listeners to believe it was ending. Stern, whose current multi-million dollar deal expires at the end of the year, reassured his audience that reports about the show's cancellation were false. This marks the third time Stern has negotiated a contract extension with the satellite radio company since he joined the platform.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, former Labour deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has stated that the party's next deputy must be a woman from outside of London. The party's National Executive Committee has initiated an accelerated election process, with a winner to be announced on October 25. The contest is seen as a pivotal moment that could influence the party's future direction, particularly concerning workers' rights and public service investment. Several potential candidates are being discussed, while the tight nomination schedule has drawn criticism from some party members as being undemocratic.</p>

          <p>European stocks closed higher on Monday as investors monitored a critical confidence vote in France that could oust Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Major indices like the CAC 40 and DAX saw gains, driven by retail stocks, as Bayrou faces opposition to his proposed €44 billion in budget cuts. If the prime minister loses the vote, President Emmanuel Macron will need to appoint his fifth prime minister in under two years. The market's positive performance also comes as investors await key U.S. inflation data later in the week, which could influence Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The essay was published as he concluded a promotional tour with Nike, marking a notable engagement nearly six years after a controversy involving the NBA and China. In 2019, a tweet from a team manager supporting Hong Kong protesters created a major rift, leading Chinese broadcasters to stop airing games. James's recent essay, in which he hopes to contribute to Chinese basketball, signals a significant warming in the relationship between the NBA and China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As household debt in the U.S. continues to rise, many Americans are exploring debt relief options to manage their financial obligations. Debt relief encompasses various strategies, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, often with a lower interest rate. Other methods include credit counseling for creating manageable payment plans, and debt settlement, where a creditor agrees to accept less than the full amount owed. For more severe situations, bankruptcy offers a legal path to eliminate or restructure debts, though it carries significant consequences for one's credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground, whose placard is splattered with blood. The piece emerged shortly after mass arrests at a protest in the city and was quickly covered by authorities, who cited the building's protected status. Banksy authenticated the work on Instagram, and it has drawn significant public attention, with many interpreting it as a critique of the legal system's handling of protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a cooling job market, experts are advising federal student loan borrowers who lose their jobs on how to manage their payments. Options include enrolling in an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly bills to as little as zero based on current income, including unemployment benefits. Borrowers may also qualify for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which temporarily pauses payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Private loan borrowers generally have fewer options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to discuss potential assistance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing the best personal loan offer depends on several key factors that lenders evaluate to assess a borrower's risk. A strong credit score and a clean credit history are paramount, as they typically unlock lower interest rates. Lenders also closely examine an applicant's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, preferring a lower ratio as it indicates a greater ability to handle new payments. Additionally, stable employment, the loan amount, and the length of the repayment term all play significant roles in determining the final interest rate and conditions offered by banks, credit unions, or online lenders.
