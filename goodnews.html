          <p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled that Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Instagram's Adam Mosseri, and Snap's Evan Spiegel must testify in an upcoming trial concerning the adverse effects of social media on children. The lawsuit alleges that these companies designed addictive platforms that cause mental health harm to minors without adequate warnings. The judge deemed the CEOs' testimony "uniquely relevant" to establishing potential negligence in the companies' conduct. This case is one of many legal challenges social media companies are facing over child safety, reflecting growing legal and public scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged dramatically, climbing over 90% on Tuesday after a 127% rise the previous day. The rally was triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze against investors betting on the stock's decline. This marks a stunning reversal for the company, which had been trading as a penny stock after years of poor performance. The renewed speculative interest in Beyond Meat may also be a sign of growing frothiness in the broader market.</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock soar over 15% after reporting third-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations and raising its financial forecast for 2025. The automaker also lowered its expected financial impact from tariffs, citing recent policy updates from the Trump administration. Despite the strong adjusted earnings, GM's net income was halved due to a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback from certain all-electric vehicle plans. The company's leadership expressed confidence in its trajectory but acknowledged that achieving profitability in the EV segment will take longer than initially anticipated.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Sean Dyche as its new manager, making him the third person to lead the club in just six weeks. Dyche, who was part of the Forest academy in his youth, replaces Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed after only 39 days. The team, which finished seventh in the Premier League last season, is currently in the relegation zone and has not won a match since the season opener. Dyche stated his immediate priority is to help the underperforming players reconnect with the club's disillusioned fanbase by improving performances on the pitch.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are recommending strategies for investors to adjust their portfolios. In the current economic environment, which is stronger than previous rate-cutting cycles, experts suggest a balanced approach. For fixed income, locking in intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities of three to seven years is seen as a way to capture attractive yields without excessive risk. On the equity side, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes remains a key principle, rather than attempting to chase high-flying sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to allow university tuition fees and maintenance loans to increase annually with inflation, starting in 2026. This move is intended to address the financial unsustainability faced by universities after a decade of fee freezes. Alongside this change, new vocational qualifications called V-levels will be introduced by 2027 to streamline and replace the current landscape of nearly 900 different qualifications for post-GCSE students. The government also plans to cap fees for underperforming universities, though the criteria for assessing performance have not yet been detailed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an advice column, a stepfather asks whether he should tell his 14-year-old stepson that his biological father is a "terrible human being" involved in addiction and debauchery. The columnist, James Parker, advises against directly criticizing the biological father, as it could backfire and create conflict with the teenager. Instead, he suggests that parenting is 98% action and 2% words. By consistently modeling positive virtues like dependability, sobriety, and love, the stepfather can provide a powerful, non-confrontational counter-example that will allow the stepson to learn and draw his own conclusions over time.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, an ultraconservative member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has been elected as Japan's first-ever female prime minister. Known for her hawkish policies on China, traditional views on gender roles, and admiration for Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi's rise signals a rightward shift in Japanese politics. Despite her conservative social stances, she is not seen as a champion for gender equality, opposing same-sex marriage and supporting male-only imperial succession. Her appointment is historically significant in a country with low female representation in politics, though its practical impact on women's rights remains uncertain.</p>
