          <p>Formerly known as Tropical Storm Chantal, the system has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. Its maximum sustained winds have decreased to 35 mph as it moves north, with all tropical storm warnings being discontinued. Despite weakening, the system is still expected to bring heavy rainfall, with up to 6 inches in some areas, prompting flood watches across inland portions of North and South Carolina through Monday. The storm is forecast to continue losing strength and is expected to dissipate completely by Monday.</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle crash in Herriman, Utah, led to a dramatic explosion after an SUV struck a Domino's Pizza, rupturing a gas line. Two individuals were rescued from the SUV by courageous bystanders just minutes before the vehicle and the building were engulfed in a massive fireball. The explosion completely destroyed the Domino's and caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, but no one was inside the building at the time of the crash. Multiple people involved in the initial accident were hospitalized, but miraculously, no injuries were reported from the subsequent blast itself.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett indicated that the U.S. is finalizing a number of trade deals ahead of a critical tariff deadline this week. With President Trump's 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs set to expire, Hassett stated that recent agreements with the U.K. and Vietnam are serving as guidelines for negotiations with other nations. He mentioned that countries where deals are not yet finalized will receive letters outlining the administration's terms, suggesting a push to conclude talks. Hassett also touted the administration's strategy, claiming the threat of tariffs is successfully encouraging companies to move production to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders from the BRICS group of developing nations gathered in Rio de Janeiro, where they reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism and criticized Western-led global governance. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned what he called the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism" and accused NATO of fueling a global arms race. Russian President Vladimir Putin, attending via video, stated that the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete as economic activity shifts to emerging markets. Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping opted to skip the summit for the first time, sending Premier Li Qiang in his place.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of nations has issued a declaration from its summit in Rio de Janeiro condemning recent military strikes on Iran and the rise of unilateral trade tariffs. While the statement did not explicitly name the United States or Israel, its targets were clear. The document criticized trade measures that "distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules." On the Middle East, the declaration expressed "grave concern" and called for a two-state solution for Palestine, highlighting a diplomatic push for mediated peace rather than aligning with Iran's more hardline stance against Israel's sovereignty.</p>
