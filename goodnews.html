        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Jamie Dimon's consistent warnings about economic calamities, JPMorgan Chase has thrived under his leadership, generating record profits. Dimon's public statements often express concerns about potential crises, geopolitical turmoil, and the U.S. deficit, which some attribute to brand-building or a strategy to keep his management team focused on future risks. While his predictions haven't always materialized, JPMorgan has consistently outperformed rivals, driven by its diversified business and investments in technology. The bank's success underscores the resilience of the U.S. economy, even amidst global uncertainties, and the value of cautious leadership in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is leaving his official role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration but will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president. Despite White House officials' insistence that Musk left on good terms, President Trump has not commented on Musk's departure, especially after Musk criticized Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Musk's continued advisory role suggests his ongoing influence in the administration, despite stepping down from his formal position. The Director of National Intelligence also noted Musk's visit to discuss leveraging technology for national security, further emphasizing his continued involvement.</p>

          <p>One of the Big Bear eaglets, Sunny, has been observed hovering for the first time, marking a milestone before fully leaving the nest. Hovering involves catching the wind and lifting off the ground without completely fledging, which is the act of leaving the nest. The eaglets, Sunny and Gizmo, are around the same size as their father, Shadow, and their wingspan is over five feet. After fledging, the eaglets will still be monitored by their parents, Jackie and Shadow, who will teach them how to find food and protect them for a few months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $200,000 annuity may not cover all retirement expenses but can provide a reliable income supplement. Monthly payments vary based on age, gender, contract structure, and interest rate environment, typically ranging from $1,100 to $2,100. Annuities offer peace of mind with predictable income, protecting against market volatility and longevity risk, but they lack liquidity and may not align with legacy goals. Considering individual financial needs and goals is crucial to determine if an annuity is a worthwhile investment.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn Fein, has won his libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy. The jury awarded Adams damages of 100,000 euros, determining that the BBC had defamed him in a 2016 episode of the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight documentary series. Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA, and the case centered on his alleged role during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The BBC expressed disappointment with the verdict, while Adams stated the case was about "putting manners on the BBC."</p>

          <p>With credit card debt balances remaining high and interest rates elevated, it's crucial for borrowers to take proactive steps to manage their debt. Despite recent declines in balances, the average credit card debt remains substantial, necessitating a strategic approach to debt relief.
