          <p>The UK government plans to purchase twelve new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, bolstering its contribution to NATO's airborne nuclear mission. These jets, to be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, represent "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." The decision, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, is intended to address global uncertainty and support domestic businesses and jobs. While the US controls the release and use of pre-positioned B61 bombs in Europe, the UK maintains its independent nuclear deterrent through Trident ballistic missiles launched from Vanguard class submarines. The move signifies the RAF's return to the nuclear domain after retiring tactical nuclear weapons in 1998, enhancing its range and conventional weapon capabilities. </p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, hitting a double and a three-run home run. This marked his first multi-hit game since May 27 and his first game with multiple RBIs this season. Manager Dave Roberts noted that Conforto is trending in the right direction but faces a critical upcoming month. The performance offers a glimmer of hope for the Dodgers, who have been considering potential trade options for left field. </p>

          <p>China is implementing more measures to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance. The People's Bank of China Governor discussed strategies to weaken excessive reliance on a single sovereign currency. China is expanding the range of hedging products for international institutions and promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan. While some worry about the unpredictability of U.S. policies, China has yet to present itself as a dependable alternative due to strict capital controls and geopolitical risks.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman, achieved a stunning political upset by defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary. Cuomo conceded the race, acknowledging Mamdani's victory, who, if elected, would be the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City. Mamdani's win is seen as a sign of the Democratic Party's shift toward more progressive candidates. Cuomo is considering running in the general election on an independent line. </p>
