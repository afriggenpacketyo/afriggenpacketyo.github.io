          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee granted the media unprecedented access to the room where the Nobel Peace Prize is decided, highlighting the secretive process ahead of the official announcement. This year's deliberations are marked by significant public attention, partly due to a vocal campaign surrounding former President Donald Trump's desire for the award. The committee chairman, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, acknowledged the external pressure but affirmed their commitment to a principled, consensus-based decision. The article notes that the nomination period closed in January, making a win for Trump this year unlikely but not impossible in the future.</p>

          <p>A round-up of British newspaper headlines focuses on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's conference speech, where she pledged to abolish stamp duty, a move seen as a pitch to younger voters. Other major stories include a government plan to allow pubs and restaurants to stay open later to boost the economy, which has drawn criticism over potential disorder. The IMF and Bank of England have also issued warnings about a potential stock market correction due to the rise of AI, drawing parallels to the dot-com crash of 2000. Additionally, reports cover efforts to clear a backlog of driving tests and the discovery of lunar caves by a British scientist.</p>

          <p>Construction workers at the Port of Long Beach unearthed a World War II-era explosive device, prompting a temporary evacuation and a multi-agency response. The discovery of the 80-year-old shell led to the closure of one of the port's container terminals while the Long Beach police and fire departments, U.S. Coast Guard, and L.A. County Sheriff's Bomb Squad secured the area. A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team ultimately determined the device was safe to transport, moving it off-site for deactivation. Normal port operations resumed later the same evening.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, which includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. As part of the agreement, Israeli troops will withdraw to a pre-determined line, marking a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict. The deal was confirmed by officials from Israel, Hamas, and Qatar, which served as a mediator. This initial phase sets the stage for further negotiations on more contentious issues, such as the demilitarization and future governance of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, was captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff with law enforcement. His arrest concludes a multi-agency manhunt that spanned several months.

The May jailbreak, which involved the inmates escaping through a hole behind a toilet, highlighted significant security and design flaws at the facility, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and other cities in China's Greater Bay Area should collaboratively bid to host the Olympic Games. The author suggests that such an endeavor would foster social cohesion, inspire youth, and promote regional pride, unifying the economically dynamic but distinct communities. Hosting the Olympics could enhance cross-boundary integration by leveraging existing and future infrastructure investments, breaking down cultural barriers and reshaping how residents interact. The piece presents the games as a powerful opportunity for the region to redefine its future on a global stage.</p>

          <p>A 20-point peace plan has been proposed to end the Israel-Hamas war, calling for the immediate release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. The plan, which Israel's Prime Minister has backed, also outlines a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza. Governance of the territory would be temporarily handed to a "technocratic" Palestinian committee, with security overseen by an international force backed by Arab states. The proposal aims to demilitarize Gaza and establish a framework for long-term stability, though Hamas has not yet formally responded.</p>
