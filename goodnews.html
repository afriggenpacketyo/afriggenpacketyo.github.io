          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently holds a substantial financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee (DNC), possessing nearly five times more cash on hand. This disparity, amounting to a $57 million gap, marks the widest difference between the two parties since at least July 2020. Some Democrats express concerns that this fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, including a lack of confidence from donors and a need for a more inspiring vision. The DNC, however, highlights a surge in grassroots support, having raised approximately $40 million in individual donations since February, which is a record for that period, and it is also roughly double what it held during the same period in 2017.

Jobe's goal came 45 minutes into his full debut during a Club World Cup match, slightly later than Jude's debut goal. The 19-year-old's goal showcased anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, mirroring some of the qualities of his older brother. Jobe has been working on arriving late in the box to score, and the goal in Cincinnati demonstrated his progress. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents the administration from stripping universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued would threaten critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other technology fields. The judge deemed the policy change, which capped indirect expenses at 15%, as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Similar caps on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges. </p>
