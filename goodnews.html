          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the current North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa's appointment comes after Tavares' unexpected resignation due to profit decline and sales issues in the U.S. Filosa, a 25-year company veteran, previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. The company recently reported a 14% downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainties related to U.S. trade policy. </p>

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines, signaling a major advancement in aeronautics. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The patent was granted to the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC). High-temperature alloy turbine blades are critical for modern jet engines, directly influencing thrust output, fuel efficiency, and reliability.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalized. The London Drugs Commission, chaired by Lord Falconer, makes 42 recommendations, including removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also recommends improved public health services for cannabis-related harm, enhanced cannabis education, and support for fair access to medical cannabis.</p>

          <p>A record number of puffins have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, despite global populations declining rapidly. According to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW), 43,626 puffins were counted on Skomer Island this year, a record high. Conservationists attribute the success to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island. Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, making it a thriving habitat for seabirds.</p>
