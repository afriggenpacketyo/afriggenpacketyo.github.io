        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed provides five key tips for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental stage for many children. She advises allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, which can counterintuitively encourage them to try more foods. Other strategies include avoiding labeling foods as 'good' or 'bad,' making mealtimes enjoyable and social, being mindful of natural appetite fluctuations, and involving children in food preparation to foster familiarity. These approaches aim to reduce mealtime stress and build a healthier long-term relationship with food for the child.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a strategic shift for the pop star following the commercial underperformance of his last two introspective records. The new work incorporates cultural and musical influences from Asia and the Middle East, featuring instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian artists such as Arjit Singh. While the album aims to create joy and explore new sounds, some critics note that these influences are often assimilated into his familiar brand of frictionless pop rather than defining the tracks. The album represents Sheeran's attempt to reclaim his chart dominance by blending his signature style with global sounds.</p>

          <p>A program called Reflection Point is helping businesses build empathy and improve communication among employees by functioning as a redesigned book club for the modern workplace. Instead of business texts, colleagues read and discuss curated short stories that mirror workplace challenges, providing a safe space to share diverse life experiences. Research from the Harvard Business Review suggests a direct link between empathy and commercial success, with more empathetic companies outperforming their peers. The initiative has been adopted by nearly 150 companies to strengthen team dynamics and build a more collaborative culture.</p>

          <p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion. The pricing exceeded the initial expected range, indicating strong investor demand for the public offering. The company, which will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker "GEMI," sold 15.2 million shares to raise up to $425 million. This move follows successful listings by other crypto firms and comes as Gemini expands its offerings, including a strategic investment from Nasdaq to enhance its custodial services.</p>

          <p>Denmark has transformed its cancer care over the past 25 years, offering valuable lessons for the UK's National Health Service. Facing poor survival rates in the 1990s, Denmark initiated a long-term, politically unified strategy focused on major investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting aggressive treatment timelines, and improving the patient experience. This approach significantly boosted survival rates, surpassing the UK in several cancer types. Key elements of the Danish model include a right for patients to seek treatment elsewhere if targets aren't met and a focus on community-based care, such as at-home chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>The fictional British rock band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel to the classic 1984 mockumentary, "This Is Spinal Tap." The new film, titled "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast and director Rob Reiner, who reprises his role as filmmaker Marty DiBergi. The plot follows the band as they are contractually obligated to perform one last gig after a cover of their song goes viral. The sequel features cameo appearances from real-life music legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John, continuing the band's legacy of parodying rock 'n' roll culture.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found the previous legislation, which only allowed women to change their surnames, to be discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling noted that in many traditional African cultures, women retained their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the judgment, which has sparked a mix of praise and criticism on social media.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are testing the ability of regulators to manage a sustainable bull market without creating a volatile bubble. Beijing aims to establish the equity market as a reliable source of household income to boost consumer spending and shift wealth away from the property sector. After a recent pullback moderated the market's rapid ascent, analysts believe China may be transitioning from a period of one-way gains to a more measured "slow bull" market. This controlled growth is seen as crucial for long-term economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Original Pantry, a historic 24-hour diner in downtown Los Angeles that closed in March, is set to reopen after being acquired by real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov. The deal was made with the support of the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11, ensuring that all 25 laid-off employees will be rehired and union representation will continue. The diner, a beloved city landmark since 1924, was abruptly shuttered by its former owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, following a labor dispute. The new owner plans to reopen the eatery by New Year's Eve, preserving a piece of L.A. history.</p>

          <p>Following a record-setting day for the major stock indexes, CNBC's Jim Cramer made a case against market cynics, arguing that positive economic indicators and strong corporate performance will continue to drive the market higher. He acknowledged the reasons for bearishness, including geopolitical tensions and national debt, but contended that individual company successes, a booming IPO market, and signs of a softening labor market that could prompt Fed rate cuts are overpowering the negative sentiment. Cramer urged bearish money managers to shift their perspective or risk losing investors as the bull market continues its run. (not investment advice)</p>

After a recent appeal to an internet content creator went viral, the man, Andrew Hillhouse, came forward. He explained that he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after his partner gave him the incorrect venue name, only realizing his mistake when the bride he didn't recognize walked down the aisle.</p>
