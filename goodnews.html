          <p>Newcastle United has reportedly rejected an initial offer from Liverpool for their star striker, Alexander Isak, with the club valuing the Sweden international at a substantial £150 million. Despite Newcastle's Champions League qualification, Isak's absence from the pre-season tour signals his desire for a transfer, as he trains separately at his former club. Liverpool's bid, rumored to be around £110 million plus add-ons, did not meet Newcastle's high asking price. While Newcastle insists the 25-year-old is not for sale this summer, Liverpool's manager Arne Slot remains determined to add the prolific forward to his squad before the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Joby Aviation and L3Harris have announced a partnership to develop a next-generation hybrid defense aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. This collaboration combines Joby's expertise in vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's military systems and certification knowledge. The companies aim to begin testing this fall, with operational demonstrations slated for 2026. This initiative reflects a strategic shift in military aviation, exploring smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable autonomous vehicles with flexible payloads as an alternative to traditional, expensive crewed aircraft, especially in light of recent global conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is substantially increasing its consumer subsidies, with plans to issue a fourth batch of funds in October, bringing the total to an annual target of 300 billion yuan. This aggressive push highlights the government's recognition of consumption as an increasingly vital component of the nation's economic growth strategy. A key element, the trade-in program, has already successfully generated over 1.7 trillion yuan in total sales revenue this year, notably boosting new energy vehicle sales by 40.3% year-on-year. These measures are designed to invigorate domestic demand and sustain economic momentum, building on the 5% year-on-year growth in national retail sales observed in the first half of 2025.

          <p>Stephen Starring Grant's memoir, "Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia and Finally Finding Home," offers a unique blend of personal reflection, cultural observation, and an indictment of government austerity.

          <p>Human-AI relationships are transitioning from science fiction to reality, with individuals like Nikolai Daskalov forming deep connections with AI companions such as Leah. This trend, fueled by advancements in generative AI, offers companionship for those experiencing loneliness, but also raises significant ethical and safety concerns, particularly regarding emotional dependency and potential manipulation. While tech giants are investing heavily in AI development, companies like Nomi are building AI companions with "memory" and "uncensored" interactions, aiming to provide supportive, non-judgmental connections. The societal implications, including potential for both positive support and negative outcomes, are still being debated as this technology rapidly evolves.</p>

          <p>Moderna has adjusted the high end of its 2025 revenue outlook downward, citing a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the U.K. that will push deliveries into early 2026. Despite this, the biotech company surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter earnings expectations, largely due to ongoing cost-cutting measures. While Covid vaccine sales continue to decline, contributing the majority of the quarter's revenue, the company noted "negligible" sales for its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. Moderna's CFO emphasized that the beat on estimates was primarily driven by a 27% reduction in operating expenses, reflecting a strategic focus on efficiency amid market changes.

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported a 23% decrease in second-quarter net income year-over-year, yet managed to surpass Wall Street's earnings estimates. This beat was largely attributed to robust production growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which mitigated the impact of lower crude oil prices. The oil giant achieved its highest Q2 output in over 25 years, pumping 4.6 million barrels per day. While its production business saw a profit decline, the refining segment's earnings increased significantly due to higher margins. Exxon also returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, remaining on track for $20 billion in buybacks this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money laundering regulation, requiring dealers of precious metals and gems to report cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (US$13,870) to the central bank's financial crime watchdog. This marks China's first such regulation expanding supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to target specific sectors. The rule also mandates reporting any suspicious transactions regardless of amount.

A new report indicates that nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices now use these plans, which tie executive pay to performance and investment returns. This shift away from informal agreements towards more formalized compensation is boosting median total pay for CEOs to $825,000 annually, with averages exceeding $3 million at larger firms. Popular incentives include co-investments, allowing executives to invest alongside the wealthy family, and carried interest, reflecting a growing sophistication in executive compensation within this sector.

          <p>European Union airports are poised to relax the long-standing 100ml liquid rule for hand luggage, a move made possible by the official approval of new medical-grade CT imaging scanners. These advanced devices offer high-resolution 3D visuals, allowing security personnel to detect explosives efficiently without impeding the screening process. While the EU Commission has authorized the change, the actual implementation timeline depends on individual airports, as most are not yet fully equipped with the technology. This development promises enhanced convenience and expedited procedures for air travelers, aiming to alleviate a significant source of frustration that has persisted since the liquid restrictions were introduced in 2006 following a foiled terror plot.</p>

          <p>The European Union will replace passport stamps with a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU travelers, including those from the UK, starting October 12. This system will require fingerprints and facial scans upon entry, with data valid for three years, aiming to enhance border security and streamline checks. While the full rollout across member nations will take until April 2026, the UK government advises travelers to prepare for potential delays during busy periods. The EES is expected to shorten wait times once fully implemented, allowing for faster verification and the use of e-gates for ePassport holders, addressing previous issues with long queues.</p>
