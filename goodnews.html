          <p>Danish renewable energy giant Orsted has received shareholder approval for a crucial $9.4 billion rights issue to ensure its financial stability. The company has been facing significant turmoil, including a recent profit warning and a halt to its Revolution Wind project off the U.S. coast by the Trump administration. Orsted is currently suing the administration to resume construction on the nearly completed wind farm. The approval of the capital raise was met with some relief by investors, causing a modest rise in the company's struggling share price.</p>

          <p>The world's largest iceberg, known as A23a, is nearing the end of its nearly 40-year journey as it rapidly breaks up and melts in the warmer waters of the South Atlantic. After breaking off from Antarctica in 1986, the iceberg spent decades grounded on the seafloor before beginning its final drift in 2023. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey are tracking its disintegration, noting that while its demise is a spectacular natural process, it is not directly linked to climate change. Samples taken from its path will provide valuable data on the environmental impact of such large-scale melting events.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. men's national team captain Michael Bradley is set to be honored for his long and decorated career, which remains a subject of debate among American soccer fans. The article reflects on Bradley's 151 appearances, noting that despite his success and key role in two World Cups, he was often a polarizing figure. His intense, no-nonsense demeanor and the fact that he played under his father, coach Bob Bradley, made him a Rorschach test for fans' views on the U.S. soccer establishment. Yet, his relentless work ethic and on-field intelligence established him as one of the nation's best-ever midfielders.</p>

          <p>China has announced an ambitious goal to expand its sports industry to 7 trillion yuan (US$980 billion) by 2030, nearly doubling its current scale. The plan, outlined in a new central government directive, is part of a broader strategy to boost domestic consumption and shift toward a consumption-driven economy. The initiative aims to cultivate internationally influential sports companies and events, capitalizing on the growing public enthusiasm for spectator sports.

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom increased by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The growth was largely attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament, which spurred spending at clothing, footwear, and online stores. This data release was delayed and included revisions to past figures after the ONS acknowledged errors in its data collection. Despite the monthly rise, economists caution that the boost from temporary factors may not be sustained, especially with potential tax increases on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A notable political trend is emerging ahead of the midterms: numerous young Democrats under 40 are launching congressional campaigns, often challenging established members of their own party. In contrast, young Republicans are largely staying on the sidelines, with organizers suggesting this reflects satisfaction with their current leadership's effectiveness against the Trump administration's agenda. This generational divide highlights differing strategies, with Democrats facing internal pressure for new leadership while young conservatives appear content to follow a more traditional path to power by waiting for seats to open up.</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal framework governing the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during arrests and enforcement operations. Federal law grants agents broad powers to question and arrest individuals without a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally and likely to flee. However, recent court rulings have pushed back on using factors like race or language to establish suspicion. The piece also clarifies rules regarding entry into private homes, the use of force, and the rights of individuals during encounters with immigration officers.</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced discussions with the Export-Import Bank of China to restructure its debt, including a proposal to make repayments in Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollars. The move is aimed at easing pressure on Kenya's foreign reserves and could significantly lower the interest rate on loans for major infrastructure projects like the Standard Gauge Railway. According to Kenya's Treasury, switching to yuan-denominated debt would reduce the interest rate from over 6% to approximately 3%. This potential agreement reflects a broader trend of yuan internationalization in bilateral finance.</p>

For UK observers, the Moon will rise already in total eclipse around 19:30 BST.
