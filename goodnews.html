          <p>Behind the England women's national team's Euro 2025 victory was a carefully cultivated environment designed to be a "home away from home." The Football Association provided a five-star base in Zurich where players relaxed with hobbies like building Lego, playing the piano, and doing jigsaw puzzles to stay calm between high-stakes matches. This atmosphere, which included family visits and even a team barista with a pet dog, fostered a strong sense of camaraderie and normality that was crucial to their success on the field.</p>

          <p>A new study from Swiss universities suggests that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of infection. Researchers used virtual reality to show participants avatars of human faces, some of which appeared sick with rashes or a cough. Blood samples taken from those who viewed the sick-looking avatars showed increased activity of innate lymphoid cells, which are key to the early stages of an immune response. The findings indicate the brain can prime the body for a fight against pathogens based on visual cues alone.</p>

          <p>To combat a deepening demographic crisis marked by a third consecutive year of population decline, the Chinese government is introducing a new subsidy program. The policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) per year for each child under the age of three. This national initiative follows various provincial-level efforts to encourage child-rearing, as young couples are increasingly deterred by high costs and career concerns. However, analysts believe the subsidy, while a positive step, may be too small to significantly impact the birth rate.</p>
