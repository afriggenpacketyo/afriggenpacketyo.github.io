          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage aimed at health-conscious consumers. The new drink, available in original and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain prebiotic fiber, five grams of sugar, and 30 calories per serving. This move follows Pepsi's recent acquisition of the prebiotic soda brand Poppi and reflects a broader strategy to introduce healthier product options amid changing consumer preferences. The company is responding to the growing market for functional beverages that support gut health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declassified and released a vast collection of federal records related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The release, ordered by the President, includes FBI and CIA documents detailing the investigation and the search for convicted assassin James Earl Ray. While some of Dr. King's relatives supported the move for transparency, his living children urged the public to view the files with caution, noting the FBI's history of illegal surveillance against their father and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a move seen as an overture to Beijing amid the country's shifting foreign policy. Effective Tuesday, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This policy change comes as President Javier Milei seeks to balance relationships with both the U.S. and China, particularly as trade negotiations with Washington have been delayed.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly campaigning for improved pay and benefits, wearing "Pay us what you owe us" shirts during the All-Star Game warm-ups. The players opted out of their collective bargaining agreement and are negotiating for a new deal that includes a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and a softer salary cap. With the league's rapid growth in viewership and revenue, players argue their compensation should reflect their contribution to the sport's success, seeking a share closer to the NBA's 50/50 split.

          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer cheaper alternatives to personal loans or credit cards. Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC being marginally cheaper. However, HELOC rates are variable and can change, while home equity loan rates are fixed, providing payment stability. Prospective borrowers should weigh the slight upfront cost difference against the risk of future rate fluctuations, as the home serves as collateral for both loan types. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high interest rates, making them an attractive option for parking a significant sum like $20,000. These CDs can provide protection against market fluctuations while offering a fixed return over a short period, typically a year or less. However, savers should recognize that long-term CDs, despite lower rates, may yield more interest over time. Additionally, the most competitive CD rates are often found at online banks rather than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article revisits advice from the late Charlie Munger, who once bluntly stated his belief that homeownership is primarily for married couples, not single people. At a 1998 Berkshire Hathaway meeting, Munger remarked, "The single people, I don't care if they ever get a house," suggesting a home should be bought out of necessity, which he defined as "when your wife wants one." His perspective contrasted with Warren Buffett's view of home buying as a low-return capital investment. The advice is presented as particularly relevant today amid soaring home prices.

This proactive stance is a notable shift from the entertainment industry's typically reactive approach to online hate.

Unlike other loans, repayments are typically deferred until the home is sold or the owner passes away, making it a stable option in a high-interest-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>
