          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was questioned by the Secret Service regarding a social media post featuring seashells arranged to read "86 47," a phrase critical of Donald Trump. Administration officials claimed the post was an assassination threat, prompting the investigation. Comey voluntarily participated in the interview, while critics argue the administration is exaggerating the situation to harass a political opponent. This article highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and Trump, stemming from the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The incident underscores the sensitivity surrounding perceived threats against political figures and the potential for politicization of law enforcement investigations.</p>
