        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, CEO of the AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key R&D employees in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This strategic move is part of an escalating talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, with major companies like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft also making significant hires from startups. The agreement includes a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology, while Windsurf will continue to operate independently and can license its tech to others. This acquisition highlights the growing importance of tools that utilize AI to assist developers.</p>

          <p>China is poised to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 rival drugs to Novo Nordisk's Ozempic currently in clinical trials. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China next year, much earlier than in other markets. This is expected to pave the way for cheaper, generic versions, potentially making these treatments more accessible and affordable for a large population. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers in China will compete, driving down prices in the estimated US$150 billion market.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to running a significant part of the Sinaloa Cartel. He admitted to coordinating large-scale drug trafficking operations, including fentanyl and cocaine, into the United States and using violence to protect the cartel's activities. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million. U.S. officials have hailed the plea as a major victory in their efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and combat the fentanyl epidemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a major $365-million expansion project despite a recent decline in cargo movement attributed to rising tariffs and global trade uncertainty. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of new land and extend the quay to accommodate larger ships, boosting cargo capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence in the port's long-term growth, citing the need to prepare for future demand for larger vessels. This forward-looking investment proceeds even as both the Port of Long Beach and the nearby Port of Los Angeles report significant drops in container volume.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, blocking immigration agents from conducting stops based on factors like race, language, or location in Southern California. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found sufficient evidence that agents were not meeting the 4th Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit, filed by immigrant rights groups, argued that agents were unlawfully targeting individuals in places like Home Depot parking lots and carwashes. The judge's order also mandates that detainees at a downtown facility be given 24-hour access to legal counsel.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted the inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to celebrate his long-held philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's philosophy, detailed in his 2010 book, is described as a "call to revolution" against consumerism and unsustainable practices. The summit aims to translate these ideas into practical action, linking environmentalism, traditional crafts, and spiritual well-being to address modern challenges.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's singles final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the All England Club. Swiatek, the world number one, has overcome her previous struggles on grass to reach the final, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early-career promise after taking a break for her mental health. Analysts suggest the match will hinge on which player better handles the pressure of the occasion. Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog could pose a unique challenge to the more experienced Swiatek.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is navigating rising global tensions by promoting a foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," seeking to balance relationships with key allies and rivals. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interest rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While maintaining the AUKUS security pact and the U.S. alliance, his government aims to recalibrate its posture, particularly with China. This approach asserts a more independent and sovereign path for Australia in an increasingly uncertain Asia-Pacific region.</p>

A breakthrough occurred when his single father, Sumit, discovered Viraj could type with his right thumb on an iPad, revealing a brilliant mind. In just three years, Viraj advanced from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and now hopes his story will inspire recognition for the hidden intelligence within the non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit its younger users for commercial gain. The state's Attorney General argues these features put children at risk, while the judge ruled the claims were specific enough to move forward. This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges against tech companies that focus on harmful product design rather than user-generated content, which has greater legal protection.</p>
