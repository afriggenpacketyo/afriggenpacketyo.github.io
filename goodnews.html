The judge discovered that the arguments cited multiple cases that were “entirely fictitious” or irrelevant, leading him to conclude the barrister had wasted the tribunal's time. The judge stated it was “overwhelmingly likely” that the lawyer used generative AI and then attempted to hide that fact during the hearing.</p>

          <p>Showcasing a notable advance in civilian amphibious vehicle technology, a mass-produced Chinese electric SUV, the Jetour G700, successfully navigated a 1.48-kilometer stretch of the Yangtze River. The three-ton vehicle, equipped with military-grade turbo thrusters and advanced waterproofing, completed the crossing in 22 minutes. The live-streamed event drew millions of viewers and demonstrated the vehicle's capability to operate steadily in water, marking a new frontier for commercially available amphibious technology.</p>

          <p>A review of British tennis player Emma Raducanu's 2025 season reveals a year of both significant progress and persistent challenges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The scheduled expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies after 2025 is prompting financial advisors to re-evaluate retirement strategies, particularly concerning Roth IRA conversions. Since a Roth conversion increases an individual's taxable income for the year, it could push them above the eligibility threshold for ACA subsidies, potentially leading to significantly higher health insurance premiums. This creates a complex calculation for retirees trying to balance long-term tax benefits with immediate healthcare costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the popularity of low-premium Medicare Advantage plans, many seniors continue to choose Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap. The primary appeal of Medigap is its flexibility, as it allows beneficiaries to see any doctor or specialist in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, without being restricted to a provider network. Additionally, Medigap offers more predictable out-of-pocket costs and fewer administrative hurdles like prior authorizations, which is particularly valuable for those with chronic health conditions or who travel frequently.</p>
