          <p>The UK government is implementing a new crackdown on individuals claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, aiming to save £350 million over five years. Claimants abroad for more than eight weeks will generally lose eligibility, with a specialist team using travel data to identify non-compliant cases. This initiative follows a successful pilot that recovered £17 million, and is part of broader efforts to tackle rising benefit fraud, which reached an estimated £6.5 billion in 2024/25.</p>

          <p>Adidas has issued a public apology to the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe, which closely resembled traditional huarache sandals. Executives personally delivered the apology after the design, created by Willy Chavarria, drew criticism for cultural appropriation. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had previously accused Adidas of exploiting Indigenous culture. The company pledged future collaboration with the town, which relies on handicrafts for its livelihood, and the apology was welcomed as a "historic act of recognition."</p>

          <p>India and Russia have agreed to expand bilateral trade, resisting U.S. tariff pressure imposed on New Delhi due to its increased Russian oil imports. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar emphasized the steady partnership, while both nations committed to boosting trade in sectors like pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles. This defiance comes as bilateral trade hit a record $68.7 billion, largely driven by India's oil imports. The move underscores India's strategic autonomy and its continued engagement with Russia despite Western sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have denied that recent price increases in the U.S. are a direct result of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Toyota stated its July price hike was a regular annual adjustment for operational costs, not tariffs. Honda attributed its ability to avoid passing on tariff costs to its high proportion of American-made vehicles. This contrasts with a Nikkei Asia report suggesting tariffs were being passed to consumers, highlighting the complex impact of trade policies on global supply chains and consumer prices.

The ruling cited environmental law violations and irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem.

Florida officials have filed an appeal, but the decision marks a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's immigration policies and its controversial facility.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted by a Bangkok court of royal defamation, or lese majeste, charges that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The court found insufficient evidence to convict him for remarks made in a 2015 interview regarding the 2014 coup. This ruling is considered unusual, as acquittals in such cases are rare, and it eases a significant legal threat to his family's political movement. Thaksin remains a central figure in Thai politics, despite his daughter now serving as Prime Minister.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This mechanism was identified through field surveys in Hainan, China, where densely planted corn showed reduced herbivore damage but also less growth. Researchers believe optimizing the release of linalool could offer new strategies to combat pests and increase crop yields. This finding sheds light on the complex evolutionary adaptations of corn.</p>

Both parties requested a postponement of an appeals court hearing to finalize the agreement.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest since March, though still higher than expected. This easing was primarily driven by a significant drop in rice inflation, which fell to 90.7% after two months of surging past 100%. Despite this, headline inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. Experts suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, potentially impacting purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>
