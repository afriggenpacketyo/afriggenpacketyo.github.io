          <p>An increasing number of schools across the United States are implementing Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce bans on student cellphone use in classrooms. The system requires students to secure their phones in the pouch upon entering the school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. While educators report positive changes like increased student engagement and social interaction, reactions from students have been mixed, with some welcoming the break from digital distractions and others attempting to bypass the system.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.8 billion for the next drawing, making it the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. The surge comes after 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, tying a game record for the longest streak. If a single winner emerges, they will have the option of receiving the full amount as an annuity over 30 years or taking an estimated lump-sum cash payment of $826.4 million before taxes. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceptionally low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>At the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China projected its vision for a multipolar global order, positioning itself as a key diplomatic force. The event served as a platform for President Xi Jinping to enhance China's geopolitical profile as an alternative to US influence, particularly at a time of perceived instability in Western leadership. A notable moment of bonhomie between the leaders of China, Russia, and India was seen as a powerful symbol of this shifting dynamic, signaling a united front among nations often at odds with US foreign policy.</p>

The incident occurred during a game against the Miami Marlins, prompting widespread criticism online. In response, both the Marlins and Phillies organizations stepped in to make things right. The boy received a gift bag from the Marlins and later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, the player who hit the home run, who gifted him an autographed baseball bat.</p>

          <p>At its recent party conference, Reform UK made a concerted effort to showcase a wider range of politicians, aiming to counter the perception that it is a "one-man-band" centered entirely on leader Nigel Farage. The party gave prominent speaking slots to its four MPs and other up-and-coming figures, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson. This strategy is part of the party's broader ambition to significantly increase its number of elected officials in councils and parliaments across the country.</p>

          <p>A new UK-based organization called Sisters in Service is providing a crucial support network for female military veterans who have transitioned into healthcare careers. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, a former Army officer and current NHS psychiatrist, the group addresses the unique isolation and challenges these women face, as their front-line military experiences are often misunderstood in civilian life. The community offers a space for shared understanding and mutual support through activities and meetings, helping members navigate the compounding pressures of their past service and demanding new roles.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who used his computer skills to spread Catholic teachings online, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint. Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, was nicknamed "God's influencer" for creating websites that documented Eucharistic miracles. The Catholic Church has attributed two miracles to his intercession, fulfilling the requirement for sainthood. His canonization is seen by the Vatican as a significant opportunity to connect with and inspire a younger generation of believers in the digital age.</p>

          <p>As Dame Anna Wintour transitions from her long-held role as editor-in-chief of US Vogue to a global editorial director position, questions arise about the magazine's future relevance. Wintour is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with celebrity and pop culture, making it a powerful cultural arbiter for decades. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits the iconic brand but faces the challenge of maintaining its influence in a crowded, fast-paced digital media landscape where the power of traditional print magazines has significantly diminished.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will change how non-EU citizens cross into the 29-country Schengen Area. The system will replace manual passport stamping with a digital record, requiring travelers, including those from the UK, to register biometric data such as fingerprints and a facial image on their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns have been raised about potential for significant delays and long queues during the initial registration process.</p>

          <p>US independent director Jim Jarmusch has won the prestigious Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his film "Father Mother Sister Brother." The comedy-drama, starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, explores the complex relationships between adult children and their parents. The festival's second-highest honor, the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize, went to "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a powerful film about a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed by Israeli forces. Acting awards were presented to China's Xin Zhilei and Italy's Toni Servillo.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four off Ed Barnard, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls single-handedly turned the game around after Somerset's chase of 191 had looked unlikely. The thrilling finish sends Somerset to their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected domestic terrorist who was on the FBI's most wanted list for 21 years, is facing an extradition hearing in London to be sent back to the United States. He is the prime suspect in two 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area linked to an animal rights extremist group. After a high-speed chase, San Diego vanished, leaving behind a car that former agents described as a "bomb-making factory." He was discovered and arrested last year living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales.</p>
