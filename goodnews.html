          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) report that a small meteor, observed as a bright orange glow and a loud bang over the UK, likely scattered debris across the west Highlands of Scotland. The meteor, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was tracked descending to approximately 12 miles above the ground. Potential landing sites for the meteorite fragments are estimated to be in a vast, mountainous area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht, near Ben Nevis. UKMON is appealing to the public for help in locating the pieces, though acknowledges the challenging terrain will make discovery difficult.</p>

          <p>At a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," a sweeping tax-and-spend package that extends his 2017 tax cuts and boosts funding for defense and border security. Trump framed the legislative victory as a perfect birthday present for America ahead of the Fourth of July. During the event, which kicked off the nation's 250th-anniversary celebrations, he also announced unconventional plans for the commemoration, including a UFC championship fight to be held on the White House grounds for 25,000 spectators. The rally featured campaign-style rhetoric and criticism of political opponents.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu is set to face a formidable challenge against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. Raducanu advanced after a strong performance against the 2023 champion, Marketa Vondrousova, but acknowledges the significant gap she needs to bridge to compete with the sport's top players. Sabalenka is the overwhelming favorite, known for her powerful serve and dominant baseline game that has led her to at least the quarter-finals in her last ten Grand Slam appearances. Raducanu stated she needs to add more weapons to her game and play aggressively to have a chance against her opponent.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he "understands what anchors" US President Donald Trump, attributing their good working relationship to a connection based on shared family values. In a BBC interview, Starmer revealed that this personal rapport was instrumental in securing a vital trade deal that exempted key UK industries from US tariffs. He also shared that Trump had called to offer condolences after the death of his brother, highlighting a personal connection despite their different political backgrounds. Starmer argued that building such international relationships is crucial for serving the UK's national interest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered the best start of his career, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning and pitching into the eighth for the first time. May allowed just two runs and struck out nine, leading the Dodgers to a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox and completing a series sweep. The win marked the Dodgers' fourth in a row and ninth in their last ten games. The offense provided early support, with Freddie Freeman driving in three runs and Michael Conforto adding a two-run homer, securing a comfortable lead that May effectively defended through seven dominant innings.</p>

          <p>Global hearing solutions company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first markets worldwide to receive the technology. The device was launched via Hainan province and Hong Kong. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, Cochlear's implant works by bypassing damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals. The company's chief technology officer explained that the system is most effective for users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom conventional hearing aids are no longer beneficial, offering a significant advancement in hearing technology.</p>

          <p>China's government has vowed to tackle the issues of oversupply and excessive, low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a meeting with industry leaders, Minister Li Lecheng emphasized the need to govern the sector according to regulations and guide companies toward improving quality and phasing out outdated production capacity. The move follows a directive from President Xi Jinping to address "disorderly low-price competition" and reduce excess industrial capacity. The goal is to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of China's solar industry, which continues to be a dominant force in global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a trip that is fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Newsom will tour eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, a move his advisors claim is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting how rural communities are being left behind. However, the visit to South Carolina, which will hold one of the first Democratic primaries in 2028, is being widely interpreted as groundwork for a future national run, following other high-profile overtures to voters in southern states.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a major breakthrough in chimera research by cultivating a beating heart structure composed of human cells inside a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, reported that the human-cell-derived heart structure continued to beat unaided for 21 days. To achieve this, scientists reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival within the pig embryo before implanting them. This development follows a previous success by the same team in growing humanized kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for creating human organs for transplantation.</p>
