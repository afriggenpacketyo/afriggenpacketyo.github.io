          <p>China is facing a significant rocket shortage that is hampering its efforts to build a massive satellite internet network to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The national priority project, Guo Wang, has recently accelerated its launch schedule, consuming a large share of the available Long March rockets. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, struggling for launch capacity. As a result, Qianfan is now turning to private rocket companies, issuing a large tender to deploy 94 satellites by early next year, highlighting the growing domestic competition for space access.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally exporting millions of dollars worth of advanced AI chips, including Nvidia's H100 GPUs, to China. The individuals allegedly operated a company, ALX Solutions, to ship the technology without the required export licenses, which were implemented in 2022 to restrict China's access to sensitive semiconductor technology. The defendants are accused of using transshipment points in Malaysia and Singapore to conceal the final destination of the high-tech components, facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has successfully created methanetetrol, a highly unstable "super alcohol" long theorized to exist within interstellar clouds. By simulating the extreme conditions of deep space in a lab—freezing carbon dioxide and water and bombarding the ice with high-energy radiation—researchers produced the molecule for the first time. The discovery demonstrates that unexpected and counterintuitive chemistry occurs in space, opening new avenues for understanding how complex molecules, potentially including precursors to life, could form in the universe. The molecule is too unstable to exist naturally on Earth.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The site's future is uncertain, but local officials hope the property, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, can be redeveloped.</p>

          <p>Economists and policy thinkers in China are currently debating whether the country should set official, measurable targets for consumer spending in its upcoming five-year plan. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that establishing a "household consumption rate" as a national metric is crucial for expanding domestic demand, noting China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. However, other experts express concern that such a target may not be operationally feasible as a policy goal, highlighting a key point of contention in China's strategy for future economic growth.

          <p>After an underwhelming start to his MLB career followed by a shoulder injury, Dodgers' rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing signs of a potential comeback. The 23-year-old Japanese phenom has been progressing in his throwing program, with coaches noting improved velocity and the addition of a new two-seam fastball. While he was initially seen as a long-term project, the team is now hopeful he could rejoin the active roster by late August. His return could provide valuable pitching depth, either as a starter or a reliever, for the team's postseason push.</p>

Many of these accounts were tied to criminal centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target individuals with fake investment schemes and other fraudulent activities. The company worked with partners like OpenAI to disrupt these networks. In conjunction with the crackdown, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to alert users of potential scams, such as when they are added to a group chat by an unknown contact.</p>

AMD's data center segment, which includes its AI chips, saw revenue grow 14% to $3.2 billion.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional authority. The judge found that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone communities that rely on the funds for critical infrastructure projects.

          <p>A massive, China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan is reportedly making significant progress after being stalled for 17 years. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) announced it is ready to begin extraction this year at the Mes Aynak Mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits. The project, first contracted in 2008, was delayed by security issues and the presence of ancient archaeological remains. The Taliban government has since approved a switch to underground mining, a costlier method intended to better protect the historical sites.</p>

The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has been added to the World Health Organization's watchlist. However, the WHO assesses the global public health risk as "low," and current evidence does not suggest it causes more severe disease or significantly different symptoms than previous Omicron variants.

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face persecution or torture. This move effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, halting a policy the Trump administration had credited for a record drop in illegal border crossings. Migrants will now be processed under standard immigration law.</p>
