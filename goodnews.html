          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly licensing development rights for innovative medicines to global pharmaceutical companies, driven by cost-saving measures. Many deals utilize a "newco structure," combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend reflects an alternative to raising funds by selling shares amid depressed valuations. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, leading to a surge in the company's shares.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. This agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and is contingent on Japanese facilities completing registration and passing radiation checks. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The resumption of seafood trade marks a significant milestone in easing tensions between the two countries, though some restrictions remain.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a shift in regulatory approach, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be seen as an ally to the crypto industry. Binance is also deepening its involvement in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the country's newly formed Crypto Council.</p>
