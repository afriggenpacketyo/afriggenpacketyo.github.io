          <p>Robinhood has finalized its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, a long-standing cryptocurrency exchange, marking a strategic shift beyond retail trading into institutional services. The all-cash deal provides Robinhood with an immediate international presence, including over 50 active crypto licenses across Europe, the UK, and Asia, as well as an established institutional client base. This move allows Robinhood to offer institutional crypto flows, lending and staking infrastructure, and white-label "crypto-as-a-service" products, catering to hedge funds, fintechs, and registered investment advisors, and Robinhood aims to rebrand itself as a serious player in the evolving digital asset finance landscape. The company intends to combine its retail strengths with Bitstamp's institutional offerings for a more comprehensive service.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of "sanctuary jurisdictions" from its website days after posting it, following criticism from mayors and law enforcement. The list included cities and counties DHS claimed were noncompliant with federal statutes, and the agency demanded these jurisdictions align with federal immigration laws. The National Sheriffs' Association accused DHS of lacking transparency in compiling the list, and local leaders expressed confusion over their inclusion. The Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considers "sanctuary," such as ending coordination on naturalization ceremonies and reviewing federal disaster aid.</p>
