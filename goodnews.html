          <p>In contrast to the tragedy at other locations, the Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, a summer camp near the Guadalupe River, successfully evacuated about 70 children and adults before the devastating flash floods hit. Camp officials, monitoring weather reports and rising waters on their own, acted proactively without an official warning from local authorities. This decision highlights the self-reliance of some camps in the face of the sudden disaster and raises questions about the official warning system. The camp suffered some damage but accounted for all its guests.</p>

The age of consent in the UAE is 18, and the girl's mother reported him to authorities. Fakana, now 19, received a royal pardon from Dubai's ruler. Campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported his case, highlighted the risks for tourists unaware of the strict local laws, as Fakana was unaware the girl was under 18.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have installed a new tile wall in their stadium inspired by the iconic mosaic murals in the tunnels of Los Angeles International Airport. The move also brings recognition to Janet Bennett, the 96-year-old artist who designed the original LAX murals in 1961 but was largely uncredited for decades, with her boss often receiving attribution. The Dodgers organization contacted Bennett for her blessing on the project, which she gave, advising them not to limit the colors to just Dodger blue. A sign at the stadium now credits Bennett for her influential work.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Taiwan will participate in Japan's memorial ceremonies for the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend the August 9 ceremony. This move comes after Nagasaki faced controversy last year for excluding Israel from the event. The decision to include Taiwan, which Japan does not officially recognize diplomatically, is a sensitive one that is likely to be watched closely by Beijing, which considers the island a breakaway province.</p>

          <p>A hiker who fell 26 feet into a crevasse on a Swiss glacier was saved thanks to his small, long-haired Chihuahua. The man, who was stuck in the ice, managed to make a distress call, but rescuers in a helicopter had difficulty locating the small hole on the vast glacier. A rescue specialist then spotted the tiny dog perched on a rock right next to the opening where its owner had fallen. The "four-legged hero" remained by the spot throughout the rescue, and its presence was crucial in guiding the team to the man's exact location.</p>

          <h2>Economists Say Trump's Power Over the Federal Reserve Is Limited Despite Public Attacks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 07:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's persistent public attacks and threats against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, economists assert that his actual power to influence the central bank's policy is limited. The Federal Reserve is structured to be independent and nonpartisan, with interest rate decisions made by a 12-member committee through consensus. While Trump can appoint some members over time, his immediate ability to force rate cuts is minimal. Powell has publicly resisted the president's pressure, and economists warn that undermining the Fed's independence could lead to severe economic problems like high inflation.

          <p>This article suggests that Marvell Technology could be an attractive investment, as its stock has fallen in 2025 despite strong underlying business growth. The chip designer's valuation is currently lower than the Nasdaq-100 average, creating a potential buying opportunity. Marvell is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding market for custom artificial intelligence (AI) processors and data center components. The company aims to significantly increase its market share in these areas by 2028, which could lead to substantial revenue growth far exceeding current analyst expectations.

          <p>In a surprising display of sportsmanship, South Africa's cricket captain Wiaan Mulder declared his team's innings, leaving himself stranded at 367 not out and passing up a clear opportunity to break a historic record. He was just 33 runs short of Brian Lara's iconic 400 not out, the highest individual score in a Test match. Mulder's score is the fifth-highest in Test history and a new record for a South African. The decision echoes a similar move by former Australian captain Mark Taylor in 1998, who declared to remain tied with a national hero's record.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave to Parents Experiencing Early Miscarriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:30:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners, including musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a huge step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a true bereavement rather than an illness.</p>
