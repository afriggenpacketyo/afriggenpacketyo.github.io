          <p>Newly released audio clips from former special counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Joe Biden's handling of classified documents reveal instances where Biden struggled to recall dates of significant events, including his son's death. The audio is from interviews that occurred after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. The Biden administration initially resisted releasing the audio, citing executive privilege, but the Trump administration moved to release it, arguing that transparency is important. The release follows reports detailing concerns about Biden's mental acuity, although a spokesperson for Biden stated that the audio simply confirms information already made public.</p>

          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill has advanced through a key committee in the House, overcoming Republican infighting and moving closer to a full vote. The bill would extend tax cuts from President Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending, paid for partly by cuts to Medicaid and green subsidies. While some hard-line Republicans received concessions, other factions remain unhappy, and analysts suggest the bill could add trillions to the national debt.</p>
