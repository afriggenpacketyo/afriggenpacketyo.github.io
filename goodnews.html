          <p>Republican activist Scott Presler is leading a voter registration drive in New Jersey, aiming to build on recent GOP gains to win the upcoming gubernatorial election. He points to the narrow 84,000-vote loss for Republican Jack Ciattarelli in 2021 as evidence that the state is more competitive than its "blue" reputation suggests. The strategy involves maximizing turnout in rural counties and conducting outreach to diverse communities. Presler believes the "America First" message and policies like tax-free tips will resonate with working-class voters.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a baby boy from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, believed to be the longest storage time to result in a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, allowed Linda and Tim Pierce to have a child after years of infertility. The embryo was originally created and donated in 1994 by a woman who, after having one child, wanted her remaining embryos to have a chance at life. This event highlights advancements in fertility science and raises discussions about the millions of frozen embryos in storage.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged over 5% on their second day of trading, following a massive debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's stock more than tripled on its first day, closing with a 250% gain after being priced at $33 per share. Figma is the latest in a series of tech companies to go public, signaling a potential revival of the IPO market. The successful launch comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was abandoned in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While interest rates on savings vehicles like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain elevated, they have declined from their peaks in the previous year. A comparative analysis shows that a $10,000 deposit in various CD terms would have earned significantly more interest if opened in August 2024 versus August 2025. For example, a 3-year CD would have yielded over $500 more in earnings a year ago. Despite the lower returns, the article suggests CDs may still be a favorable option compared to variable-rate accounts, given the potential for future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the second day of the fifth Test match at The Oval, Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna and England batter Joe Root were involved in a heated verbal exchange. Krishna later stated that the confrontation was a deliberate tactic to disrupt Root, though he was surprised by the animated reaction from the English player. He described the incident as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The tense moment is part of a series that has seen several confrontations between the two teams.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. is expected to announce a deal giving the NFL an equity stake in its sports media giant, ESPN. In exchange, ESPN would likely take over the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This partnership would deepen the financial ties between the league and one of its major broadcast partners ahead of future media rights negotiations. The move comes as ESPN adapts to the changing media landscape, with declining cable subscriptions and a new direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized physical education assessment that was phased out in 2013. The test, which included exercises like the one-mile run and shuttle run, was a staple in American schools for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat declining physical fitness and rising obesity among children, which it frames as a threat to national vitality. While some educators support the focus on physical activity, others express caution about its potential negative impacts.</p>

The new project is projected to generate enough electricity to power every household in Scotland approximately twice over, marking a significant step in the country's renewable energy efforts. The timing of the announcement has been viewed as a pointed rebuttal to Trump's strong anti-wind energy stance.
