          <p>U.S. employers added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and indicating a resilient labor market despite slowing economic growth. The unemployment rate decreased to 4.1%, the lowest since February. Government employment, particularly state and local education, led the gains, with health care also adding significant positions. This robust job report suggests the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts, though economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
