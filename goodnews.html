          <p>Economists Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognized their contributions to understanding the dynamics of technological progress and its impact on prosperity. This award, officially the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was created in 1968. The announcement concludes this year's Nobel prize week, with the committee noting past criticism over the lack of diversity among laureates.</p>

          <p>Former Scotland rugby captain Stuart Hogg has revealed that his decision to retire from the sport was an attempt to save his marriage, a choice he now calls the "biggest mistake" of his life. The 100-cap player, who recently returned to the sport with French club Montpellier, spoke about his mental health challenges, including using alcohol to cope and being on antidepressants before his initial retirement. Hogg, who pleaded guilty to domestic abuse last year, stated he is now in a better mental state and is learning to be selfless for his family and team.</p>

This major philanthropic gift from the Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner will support students at Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College.

The 33-year-old, who was part of Luton's youth academy before joining Arsenal, succeeds Matt Bloomfield at the club, which has suffered consecutive relegations from the Premier League and Championship. Wilshere, who previously coached Arsenal's under-18s and was an interim coach at Norwich City, described the appointment as a "full-circle moment." He will be assisted by former England international Chris Powell, as the club aims to rebuild and climb back up the football league.</p>

          <p>An NPR story recounts how a college student, Silvana Clark, was able to continue her education because of the secret generosity of her drama professor, George Meshke. Facing financial hardship in 1971 and about to drop out, Clark was told by Meshke that she had unexpectedly received a college drama scholarship that would cover her next semester's tuition. She later discovered from the financial aid office that no such scholarship existed and realized her professor had paid the fees himself. This quiet act of kindness enabled her to stay in school, secure better employment, and ultimately graduate.</p>

Over his 50-year career, Nakamura has earned numerous prestigious awards for his pioneering research in synthetic and physical chemistry. He is particularly renowned for developing a technique known as single-molecule atomic-resolution time-resolved electron microscopy (Smart-EM), which allows for the observation of individual molecules' movements and reactions. His work has significantly advanced the field of organic synthesis, with recent research focusing on creating nanoscale artificial diamonds at room temperature.</p>

          <p>Hamas has released the first seven surviving Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, marking the initial phase of a ceasefire agreement brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump. This transfer is the first step in a larger deal that includes the release of more living captives and the remains of deceased hostages, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The development comes as over 20 world leaders, including Trump, prepare to meet in Egypt for a summit aimed at securing a lasting peace and planning the reconstruction of Gaza after a devastating two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has traveled to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend an international summit focused on finalizing a peace plan for Gaza. The summit, led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, follows the implementation of the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas. Downing Street stated that Starmer will pay tribute to President Trump's role in brokering the agreement. However, the UK's own claimed involvement has been disputed by Israeli officials, who suggested recent UK government decisions had actually emboldened Hamas's position during negotiations.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching initiatives to better connect with young people, as recent surveys reveal significant skepticism among Generation Z regarding the bloc's democratic processes and effectiveness. A TUI Foundation survey found that many young Europeans feel the EU is poorly implemented or too focused on trivial matters, and voter turnout in this demographic has declined. In response, the EU Commission is holding "Youth Policy Dialogues" on topics like cyberbullying to incorporate youth perspectives into policymaking. However, experts note the EU's limited power in key youth-centric areas like housing and employment presents a challenge to delivering tangible, visible results.</p>
