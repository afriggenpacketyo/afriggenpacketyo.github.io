        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's access to a system tracking student visa applications. Trump stated that Harvard has acted appropriately during negotiations and that a settlement could be historically significant. This follows previous actions by the Department of Homeland Security to potentially revoke Harvard's student visa system certification due to alleged antisemitism on campus, and Trump's order barring most international students from studying at Harvard. The legal battles have implications for Harvard, where a significant portion of the student body comes from outside the United States.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's parents have spoken out after their daughter's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer. The parents expressed a mix of relief and lingering uncertainty, acknowledging the emotional toll the two-year legal battle took on their family. They praised Karen's strength and active involvement in her defense, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" on the case. Despite the acquittal, the family recognizes that the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, a reality they hope will one day be resolved.</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as belonging to the Denisovan species. Researchers used dental calculus to extract DNA from the 146,000-year-old skull after previous attempts to extract DNA from a tooth failed. The analysis revealed that the skull is the first intact Denisovan specimen discovered to date. Denisovans, closely related to Neanderthals, coexisted with modern-day humans. This discovery provides valuable insights into human evolution and the relationships between different hominin species.</p>
