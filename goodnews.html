          <p>England goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football, just weeks before the European Championship. Earps, who played a vital role in England's Euro 2022 victory, had recently lost her starting position to another player. She made 53 senior appearances for England over eight years, also winning the 2023 Women's Finalissima and reaching the 2023 Women's World Cup final. Earps stated that this is the right time for her to step aside and give younger players the opportunity to thrive.</p>

          <h2>Economic Shifts May Explain Growing Political Divide Between Men and Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist argues that the widening political gap between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts over the past half-century. The decline of manufacturing and the rise of the cognitive economy have disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Women, empowered by feminist messages and evolving social roles, have adapted more successfully to the changing landscape, leaving men feeling a crisis of masculinity. The author suggests redefining men's role in an inclusive way that embraces caretaking and production, rather than relying on a resurgence of manufacturing.</p>

KFC will focus on setting up shops in key locations, including Ireland and northwest England, and invest in its supply chain. The new jobs will encompass servers, kitchen staff, and managers, as KFC faces increasing competition from other chains like Wingstop and Popeyes.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April, while shipments from China fell 76%, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" strategy. This shift is a response to Washington's tariffs against China, where most iPhones were previously manufactured. However, analysts expect growth in India's iPhone shipments to plateau due to limited manufacturing capacity. Analysts also suggest that protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing could curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity, as President Trump has threatened tariffs on all iPhone shipments not manufactured domestically (not investment advice).</p>

The US is the only wealthy country without national paid leave, and maternity care costs are significantly higher. While other countries provide robust social safety nets, the US relies heavily on private resources and individual responsibility. The author argues that a commitment to flexible gender norms and a robust social safety net are essential for improving mothers' lives.</p>

          <p>Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was likely formed rapidly about 2.1 million years ago due to landscape shifts in Idaho. A new study examined ancient river sediments found inside caves within the canyon to determine its age. Researchers believe the canyon emerged when a large lake in present-day Idaho drained, leading to a "fill and spill" episode that carved out Hells Canyon. This discovery reveals that Hells Canyon is younger than the Grand Canyon.</p>

          <p>A candidate for California's state superintendent of public instruction argues that the position should be appointed rather than elected. The author contends that the elected superintendent's responsibilities have been diminished over time, making the role more administrative than policy-setting. Given California's vast and complex education system, the author believes an experienced administrator appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature would be more effective. The author suggests this change would improve accountability and coordination within the state's education system.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Scrapping Two-Child Benefit Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 05:48:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has pushed people into poverty but warned that removing it would "cost a lot of money". The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy, with the taskforce looking at the cap and nothing is off the table.</p>
