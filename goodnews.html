          <p>Five individuals, including three women, a child, and the pilot, were successfully rescued after surviving for 36 hours in a swamp teeming with alligators in the Bolivian Amazon following an emergency landing. The pilot, Andres Velarde, recounted that the plane began losing altitude, forcing him to land in a swamp near a lagoon, where they were surrounded by alligators and an anaconda. They survived by eating cassava flour brought by one of the passengers and were eventually spotted by local fishermen, leading to their rescue via helicopter. All five were reported to be in excellent condition despite their ordeal.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved its first local council control in 10 areas, along with two mayoral positions, signaling a shift in British politics. Nigel Farage's party plans to implement efficiency measures, inspired by Donald Trump's 'Doge' initiative, focusing on cutting council spending on climate change initiatives and diversity programs. Reform aims to resist central government placement of asylum seekers in their controlled areas, with a focus on prioritizing essential services and reducing what they view as excessive expenditure. The party's deputy leader acknowledges the inexperience of newly-elected councillors but believes it will bring fresh perspectives and common sense to local governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decline in insurance-underwriting profits, which were impacted by Southern California wildfires. Warren Buffett cautioned that tariffs and geopolitical events are creating considerable uncertainty for the conglomerate, making it difficult to predict their potential impact on the business. Despite the earnings decline, Berkshire's cash hoard grew to a record $347 billion as Buffett continued to be a net seller of stocks, primarily reducing holdings in Apple and Bank of America. Buffett also criticized protectionist trade policies, stating that 'trade should not be a weapon'.</p>

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's trade policy, stating that "trade should not be a weapon." He argued that protectionist policies could have negative consequences for the U.S. and that the country should focus on trading with the rest of the world based on comparative advantages. Buffett's comments came after Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that indicated tariffs and geopolitical events created "considerable uncertainty" for the company. Despite a large cash reserve of $347 billion, Berkshire has been in a defensive mode, selling stocks for 10 straight quarters, reflecting Buffett's cautious outlook on the current economic environment.</p>

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school already trialing the initiative to encourage students to focus on lessons and interact more. The pilot program, called "Smart without your phone", requires students to leave their phones in their schoolbags during the day, with sanctions for violations. Education researchers support smartphone bans, citing increased social wellbeing and reduced cyberbullying, while some student representatives express skepticism, arguing that students should learn responsible smartphone use. Other countries like France and Italy have already implemented similar bans, reflecting growing concerns about the impact of smartphones on learning and social interaction.</p>

Many parents are unaware of these anxieties, which can significantly impact children's well-being. The therapists offer practical coping strategies, such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, teaching affirming phrases, and scheduling a 'worry window.'

As a result, this year's crop of high school seniors is more likely to choose local and less-expensive public schools rather than private universities far from home.
