          <p>Shares of major cannabis companies, including Tilray Brands and Canopy Growth, experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could provide major tax benefits and stimulate institutional investment in the cannabis industry. While the president cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his public support has generated strong optimism among investors and industry leaders, who see it as a pivotal step toward federal reform.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved export licenses for Nvidia and AMD to sell specific AI chips to China, contingent on the companies sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This unusual arrangement is seen by analysts as a transactional approach to foreign policy that provides certainty for the chipmakers, as receiving 85% of revenue is preferable to zero. While the deal helps U.S. firms compete with Chinese rivals like Huawei, it also raises long-term uncertainty about future government demands and sets a unique precedent for strategic sectors like semiconductors.

The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates. CEO Adam Aron attributed the success to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron. The company has also restructured its debt, creating a more stable foundation to capitalize on expected industry growth into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The resumption of its IPO plans signals renewed confidence and contributes to a recent revival in the IPO market, which has seen several major tech companies go public.

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, urging the company's board to resist what he called President Trump's "artless bullying." The defense comes after Trump demanded Tan's resignation over alleged conflicts of interest and national security concerns related to his ties to Chinese companies. In an opinion piece, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, praised his leadership and turnaround capabilities, framing the situation as a test of corporate backbone against political pressure. Tan has since met with the White House to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods by signing an executive order that extends the deadline for another 90 days, until mid-November. The duties were set to increase significantly but were paused following recent trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. This extension avoids an immediate escalation in the trade war, providing temporary relief and more time for talks. The move is the latest instance of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused or altered with little advance notice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan, through their company Archewell Productions, have signed a new multiyear, first-look deal with Netflix, extending a partnership that began in 2020. This new agreement gives Netflix the first right of refusal on their projects, offering more flexibility than their previous exclusive contract. The couple has produced several documentaries for the streamer, including "Harry & Meghan," and has upcoming projects in the works. These include a second season of Meghan's lifestyle show and a feature film adaptation of the novel "Meet Me at the Lake," continuing their efforts to build their media ventures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global transition to clean energy technologies like batteries and solar panels is fueling anxiety over potential shortages of critical minerals, a concept dubbed "peak mineral." A new study suggests the world could face shortfalls of up to 12 different minerals by 2100, even under moderate emission-reduction scenarios. However, the article notes that technological innovation may mitigate these fears, much like new drilling techniques overcame "peak oil" concerns. Companies are already developing batteries that use more abundant materials and reducing the need for rare metals like cobalt, suggesting that adaptation and substitution could prevent a future crisis.</p>

          <h2>Three Key Considerations for Beginners Thinking About Investing in Gold</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether gold is a suitable investment for beginners, especially in the current economic climate of rising inflation and a strong stock market. It advises new investors to consider three main factors: their short-term financial goals, the recent price volatility of gold, and their need for portfolio diversification. While gold can act as a hedge against inflation, its high price and lower potential for short-term income compared to stocks may not be ideal for everyone. The article suggests that beginners weigh these points and potentially consult a financial advisor before allocating funds to the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The imminent takeover of the Newcastle Falcons rugby club by Red Bull has generated significant excitement, given the company's history of transforming sports teams. Fans are hopeful for a return to the club's glory days, but experts caution that a revival may be gradual due to salary caps and the current recruitment cycle. Red Bull is expected to bring financial investment and professional expertise, but will need to navigate spending limits and focus on retaining homegrown talent. The deal is seen as a major boost for the league, attracting a blue-chip brand and securing the future of a financially struggling club.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that gold will be exempt from tariffs, directly contradicting a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling.

Trump's declaration on social media immediately reversed this, causing gold futures to fall. The initial ruling could have impacted the international flow of physical gold used to back futures contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cave in Norway, hidden until the 1990s, has yielded an extensive collection of 75,000-year-old animal bones, providing the oldest evidence of Arctic biodiversity from a warmer period of the last Ice Age. The remains include a wide array of species, from lemmings and fish to whales and a polar bear. Scientists believe this diverse ecosystem thrived on melting glaciers but disappeared when the climate cooled again, as DNA analysis shows none of the ancient lineages survived the subsequent freeze. The findings highlight how even cold-adapted species struggle with dramatic climate shifts.</p>
