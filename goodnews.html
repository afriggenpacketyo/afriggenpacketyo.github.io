          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England as temperatures are expected to rise as high as 33C by the weekend, signaling a potential heatwave. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of possible impacts on health and social services, particularly for those over 65 or with pre-existing health conditions. While temperatures are not expected to break the UK's June record, the alerts serve as an early warning for the health sector and government departments.

          <p>President Donald Trump praised the UK, stating their "ultimate protection" is that he likes them, after signing a trade deal with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit. Despite ideological differences, Trump expressed warmth towards Starmer, calling him a "friend" and noting their strong alliance. The UK's cultural links with the U.S., including Trump's Anglophilia and familial ties to Britain, contribute to this favorable relationship. Vice President JD Vance signaled the deal was coming because "the president really loves the United Kingdom."</p>

          <p>The Mayor of London announced plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, aiming to revitalize the area and attract more visitors. The proposal involves banning vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, diverting 16 bus routes. While City Hall claims two-thirds of people support the ban, concerns remain about traffic diversion and the impact on local businesses and accessibility. The mayor's plan depends on establishing a new mayoral development corporation with planning powers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its meeting, keeping it in the 4.25% to 4.5% range. This decision reflects a cautious approach as the Fed monitors the impact of President Trump's tariffs and economic policies. While consumer sentiment has improved, uncertainty persists, and the inflation rate slightly increased in May. Economists predict a high probability that the Fed will hold rates steady, with some members expressing concerns about slowing growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy in certain cases. ADCs deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing side effects.

Challenges remain, including optimizing drug delivery and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target, but progress is being made with next-generation ADCs and combination regimens.</p>

          <p>Questions have emerged regarding McLaren's decision-making during a race, specifically whether Lando Norris should have been allowed to pass his teammate Oscar Piastri. While Piastri has been more consistent this season, Norris's raw speed is undeniable, though he has made several errors. The team's strategy is generally not to prioritize one driver over the other, except in specific circumstances. There is no clear argument for prioritizing Piastri given McLaren's current standing in the championship.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that the Trump Organization's newly announced smartphone, the T1, will likely be manufactured in China despite claims it will be built in the U.S. The phone, priced at $499 and running Android, will likely be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). Analysts cite the lack of readily available smartphone manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. Experts also note that manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. would be nearly impossible and would significantly increase the product's price.</p>
