        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, a view that is challenged by many autism scientists. These scientists assert that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and improved screening, not a novel environmental toxin. Genetic research has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a strong case for genetics being the most significant driver. Experts worry that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from promising genetic research, which is leading to the development of new therapies for severe autism. The scientific community largely agrees that autism is a complex disorder with multiple variables, and genetics play a critical role.</p>

          <h2>Wyoming Hospital Challenges Private Equity Logic with Community-Driven Approach</h2>

          <p>This article details the story of a Wyoming hospital that is challenging the conventional wisdom of private equity in rural healthcare. After a private-equity firm's cost-cutting measures led to the decline of their local hospital, residents of Riverton decided to build a new, community-owned hospital. Through a combination of local fundraising, government loans, and a commitment to community-driven healthcare, they are creating a model that prioritizes patient care over short-term profits. The project highlights the importance of local knowledge and investment in making decisions for a community's healthcare needs.</p>
