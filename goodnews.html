          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated his commitment to bolstering China's advanced manufacturing capabilities, a strategy that has drawn criticism from the United States and other major trade partners due to concerns about deepening global trade imbalances. During a visit to Henan province, Xi emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as crucial for China's economy. This push aligns with the "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer in sectors like electric vehicles and semiconductors. Despite significant state subsidies, China has faced challenges in meeting key targets and has fostered unhealthy industrial competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying its competition with OpenAI. The upgraded model, released on AI model repository Hugging Face, follows DeepSeek's earlier success with its free, open-source R1 model, which outperformed offerings from rivals like Meta and OpenAI. The company's low-cost and rapid development sparked concerns about overspending among U.S. tech giants. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is designed for more complex tasks through logical thought processes and benchmarks closely with OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 models. </p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority by invoking an emergency law. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce, not the president unilaterally. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which was prompted by a lawsuit from small businesses importing goods. If the appeal fails, businesses that paid tariffs will receive refunds. The decision has been welcomed by global markets, with stock markets rising and the US dollar gaining strength. </p>
