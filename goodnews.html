          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target, moving from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, marking a significant shift in the alliance's strategy. This decision, outlined in a joint declaration, underscores the bloc's unified stance against security threats, particularly Russia and terrorism. The 5% target includes a minimum of 3.5% for core defense spending, with the remainder allocated to security and defense-related critical infrastructure. Member states will be required to submit annual plans demonstrating their progress toward achieving this goal, addressing previous concerns about some members not meeting the 2% target. This agreement comes amid heightened global tensions and aims to reinforce NATO's collective defense commitment. </p>

          <p>President Trump brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which took effect after a 12-hour delay to allow final military maneuvers. John Spencer of the Urban Warfare Institute notes that such delays are common, citing historical precedents like the Korean War Armistice and the Yom Kippur War Ceasefire. He highlights the U.S. operation as a nonpartisan win against nuclear proliferation. Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold, describing it as an "off-ramp" for both sides. </p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building. Keepers used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped due to an "operational error." </p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have declined for the fifth consecutive month, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This drop is attributed to customers switching to cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's European market share has also decreased, and the company faces rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD. Shares of Tesla are down more than 15% year-to-date. </p>

          <p>Louisiana made significant efforts to attract Meta's $10 billion data center, including a 20-year sales tax exemption. The state hopes the project will transform its economy, but it will only create 500 permanent jobs. The Meta site will use twice as much electricity as New Orleans on a peak day, requiring the construction of three new gas-fired power plants. Meta sought a site where it could quickly expand into gigawatts and appreciates Louisiana's ability to provide a large, contiguous plot of land. </p>

The 12-day conflict left casualties on both sides, and the Trump administration brokered the ceasefire.

Iran's parliament voted to halt cooperation with the IAEA, raising concerns about future monitoring. </p>
