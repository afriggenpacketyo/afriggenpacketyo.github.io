          <p>Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, a milestone achieved after a rigorous journey through the minor leagues since 2016. Her debut is not a public relations stunt but the result of officiating over 1,200 minor league games and earning her position through merit and perseverance. Pawol, a former all-conference catcher and member of a world champion U.S. softball team, follows in the footsteps of pioneers in other major sports. Her call-up represents a significant moment for baseball, demonstrating that dedication and skill can break long-standing barriers.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford, playing for Fiorentina in a pre-season friendly. De Gea, who left the club two summers ago after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, providing a belated farewell. The match itself ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning the subsequent penalty shootout thanks to a save by current keeper Altay Bayindir. The event reignited discussions among fans about the club's decision to replace de Gea, especially given the mixed performance of his successor, Andre Onana.</p>

          <p>The Nasdaq reached a new record high this week, driven by a significant surge in Apple's stock price after the company pledged an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments. This commitment helped Apple secure an exemption from new semiconductor tariffs, boosting investor confidence and sending its shares up more than 13%. While the broader market saw gains, the pharmaceutical sector faced headwinds from potential new tariffs and disappointing clinical trial results from Eli Lilly. The week's activity highlights the market's sensitivity to trade policy and corporate strategy in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The four astronauts of NASA's Crew-10 mission have safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a nearly five-month stay aboard the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, JAXA's Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos' Kirill Peskov, conducted over 200 science experiments during their mission. Their return in a SpaceX capsule marks another successful flight for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which has ended U.S. reliance on Russia for transport to the station. Their replacements, the Crew-11 mission, arrived at the ISS last week to begin their own six-month tour.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, a step taken by the new liberal government to ease tensions. For months, the two nations had engaged in a Cold War-style psychological campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating noises. While a positive development, tensions may rise again with upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which the North views as a provocation.</p>

          <p>According to physical therapist John Rusin, D.P.T., the posture encouraged by frequent phone use is a primary cause of stiff and achy shoulders. This posture typically involves internally rotated shoulders, a forward-jutting neck, and a slouched spine, which he calls a 'silent killer' for shoulder health. To counteract this, the article suggests several exercises aimed at strengthening the upper back and improving posture, including band pull-aparts, rear delt raises, and face pulls. These movements are designed to restore proper shoulder position and build muscle to prevent future pain and stiffness caused by modern lifestyle habits.</p>

          <p>Developers have completed a $104 million project to convert the abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Brooklyn into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic site, which had been deteriorating for decades, now features 205 units, blending original architectural details like exposed brick with modern amenities. The project, funded by a construction loan and private equity, includes 62 units designated for affordable housing. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which was keen to see the neglected but beautiful building preserved and repurposed for the community.</p>

The recommended foods include edamame for its isoflavones, sweet potatoes and tomatoes for their collagen-boosting vitamin C and sun-protecting carotenoids, and salmon for its anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Other beneficial options are kefir for skin hydration, pumpkin seeds for their high zinc content which aids in healing, and orange juice for its vitamin C and hydration properties.

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance in a new book. He now suggests that a diversified portfolio can support a safe withdrawal rate closer to 4.7%, and potentially even higher for today's retirees. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and don't spend enough, and he encourages a more dynamic approach to get the most out of accumulated wealth. His refined strategy incorporates a wider range of assets and a "rising equity glide path" to enhance portfolio longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who became one of Europe's most famous artists, surpassing even Rembrandt and Vermeer in her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and botanist, Ruysch specialized in 'bloemstilleven,' or flower still life, a genre she perfected over a nearly 70-year career. Her paintings are noted for their scientific accuracy, dramatic lighting, and inclusion of exotic blooms and insects, reflecting the global reach of the Dutch empire. A new exhibition seeks to re-establish her significance, showcasing her technical mastery and the complex layers of meaning within her work.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle is not a mystery at all, attributing the disappearances of ships and planes to simple probability and environmental factors. He argues that the high volume of traffic in the area means the number of incidents is statistically normal on a percentage basis, a view shared by Lloyd's of London and NOAA. Factors such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather, complex navigation around numerous islands, and potential magnetic compass anomalies offer logical explanations. The article suggests that while supernatural theories are more exciting, the reality is a combination of nature and human error.</p>

          <p>Author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones cannot expect their children to develop healthy technology habits. Speaking at a panel, she explained that children often mirror their parents' behavior, and overuse of devices can negatively impact sleep, mental health, and attention spans, hindering their development. Robbins advises parents to consciously change their own habits by putting their phones away and creating physical distance from them. Instead of scolding children for screen time, she suggests getting curious about what they are doing online to foster connection rather than creating conflict over technology use.</p>
