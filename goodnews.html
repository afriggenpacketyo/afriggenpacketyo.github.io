          <h2>Trump Administration Approves New York Offshore Wind Project After Pipeline Compromise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:19:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Equinor will resume construction on its Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm in New York after the Trump administration lifted a stop work order. The project, approved by the Biden administration but halted by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, was allowed to proceed after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to move forward on critical pipeline capacity. Burgum stated that increased access to natural gas would benefit New York and New England, while Hochul reaffirmed New York's commitment to new energy projects meeting state legal requirements. The article highlights the political complexities surrounding renewable energy development and the Trump administration's stance on wind power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. The company has been diversifying its import sources, with no single country outside the U.S. representing more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to cover tariff costs. The company missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but beat sales estimates. The article highlights the differing approaches of major retailers in response to tariffs and their impact on consumers.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook is set to make his England debut in the upcoming Test match against Zimbabwe. The 27-year-old will join an inexperienced bowling attack, alongside Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, and Shoaib Bashir. Matthew Potts and James Rew will not be included in the starting lineup. Zak Crawley will remain as the opener, while Ollie Pope will return to the number three position, and Jamie Smith will be the wicketkeeper after paternity leave. The match, Zimbabwe's first in England since 2003, will be a four-day Test held at Trent Bridge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto about his effort level after Soto failed to hustle out of the batter's box on a potential home run that bounced off the Green Monster for a single. This incident follows a similar play where Soto was slow out of the box on a groundout. While Soto denies any lack of effort, Mendoza emphasized the importance of running hard in that ballpark. The article highlights the scrutiny on Soto's performance since signing a record contract with the Mets.</p>
