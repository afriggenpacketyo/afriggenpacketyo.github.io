          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $100,000 annuity purchased at age 70, noting that the amount varies based on gender, annuity type, and interest rate environment. According to Cannex data, a 70-year-old man could expect around $729 per month, while a woman might receive $689. Joint life annuities, which continue payments to a spouse, could pay about $620 per month. The article also discusses factors such as the value of guaranteed income, health status, and the desire for simplicity in determining whether an annuity is a worthwhile investment. It concludes that while an annuity may not cover all retirement expenses, it can provide a stable income foundation, especially when combined with Social Security and other savings.

          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the company behind the CrushAI app, which uses AI to simulate nude images of real people. Meta alleges that Joy Timeline made multiple attempts to circumvent Meta's ad review process to advertise CrushAI apps on Facebook and Instagram, despite violating the platforms' advertising policies. Meta bans "non-consensual intimate imagery" and has previously removed ads for nudify technology and blocked associated websites. Meta will share information about violating entities with other tech companies through the Tech Coalition's Lantern Program to combat child safety violations. </p>

The men, one armed with a machete, entered the store and held the employees down, demanding money from the safe. An employee handed them three red deposit bags, which they then grabbed before fleeing in a white Jeep Wrangler. However, the bags were empty, as the store's deposits had already been made for the day. </p>

          <p>This article reviews Mike Flanagan's film adaptation of Stephen King's novella, *The Life of Chuck*, praising Flanagan's ability to translate the story's sentimentality and structure into a crowd-pleasing film. The article notes that King's strength lies in creating lived-in worlds, and Flanagan captures this quality by highlighting the ordinary foundations upon which the supernatural is built. The film is told in three chapters, beginning at the end of Chuck's journey and featuring a strong cast, including Tom Hiddleston and Mark Hamill. While the film relies on familiar tropes, it delivers a poignant message about the wonder and terror of being human. </p>

In contrast, Rae's *Addison* is praised for its fresh and innovative sound, evoking electronic experimentalists like Aphex Twin and Timbaland.
