          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to accompany President Donald Trump on a state visit to the United Kingdom, joining other prominent U.S. business leaders. This move highlights Nvidia's strategic efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the Trump administration as the company seeks new licenses to sell its advanced AI chips in China. Huang has been actively engaging with the president to argue that allowing these exports benefits U.S. national security by ensuring American leadership in the artificial intelligence race. This follows previous successful negotiations for waivers on other chip sales to China.</p>

          <p>The 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly is set to begin, bringing together all 193 member states for global diplomacy and deliberation. As the UN's primary representative body, it operates on a "one state, one vote" basis, allowing for equal representation on issues like economic policy, security, and climate change. Although its resolutions are non-binding, they carry significant normative power and can set the stage for legally enforceable treaties. This year's session occurs amid major global conflicts and shifting geopolitical dynamics, including a new dialogue on AI governance.</p>

His visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, and he privately paid his respects by laying a wreath at her burial site in Windsor. During the awards ceremony, he met with children facing serious health issues and delivered a speech praising their courage. The Prince and Princess of Wales also marked the anniversary by attending a separate event with the Women's Institute, an organization the late Queen long supported.</p>

          <p>A family has spoken out after a viral incident at a Philadelphia Phillies game where a father who caught a home run ball was aggressively confronted by a female fan. Drew Feltwell retrieved the ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, before the woman approached them, shouting vulgarities and demanding the ball was hers. To de-escalate the situation in front of his children, Feltwell gave her the ball. The Phillies organization and player Harrison Bader later provided the family with souvenirs, including an autographed bat, to create a positive memory from the experience.</p>

Separately, a partnership between Meta Platforms and Anduril Industries was officially awarded a U.S. Army contract to develop advanced combat goggles, marking a potential new revenue stream for Meta's long-term metaverse and hardware ambitions.

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the medals awarded to 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an aerial view of the wrong city. Instead of showing the half marathon's route through Newcastle, the design depicted the nearby rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The Great Run Company acknowledged the error with a humorous "Wear [sic] sorry!" statement, noting the mistake makes the medals and matching T-shirts a unique historical keepsake. The blunder prompted lighthearted jokes online, particularly regarding the fierce football rivalry between the two cities.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with significant credit card debt, generic financial advice may not be effective. This article suggests three ways to get personalized help, starting with consulting a non-profit credit counselor who can create a comprehensive financial plan. Another option is to work with a debt relief company that can negotiate directly with creditors to potentially reduce the total amount owed. Lastly, individuals can proactively contact their credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or payment plans that can offer temporary relief and lower interest rates.

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a significant incentive of $7 per square foot to businesses, schools, and other public institutions in Southern California to replace nonfunctional grass lawns. This rebate, the largest ever offered by the agency, aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable, drought-tolerant landscapes. The program is a proactive measure to prepare for a new state law taking effect in 2027 that will prohibit the use of potable water on such lawns. The goal is to conserve vast amounts of water while also promoting biodiversity and beautifying properties.</p>

          <p>Following a routine victory against Andorra, this article examines the often predictable and unexciting nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches. Despite an impressive unbeaten streak in qualifiers since 2009, these games are frequently seen as formalities that lack the jeopardy and thrill of major tournaments. The piece reflects on memorable exceptions, like David Beckham's 2001 free-kick against Greece, while noting that most qualifiers involve England comfortably defeating inferior opponents. This raises questions about whether these matches truly gauge the team's readiness for the challenges of a World Cup.</p>

However, their final take-home amounts will differ significantly due to state tax laws.
