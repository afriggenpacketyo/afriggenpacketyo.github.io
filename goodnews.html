          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, leading to a 5% stock drop. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, below the expected $11.62 billion, while earnings per share were 83 cents against the expected 50 cents. Gross bookings are expected to reach between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion in the current quarter. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed the FTC lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, and highlighted the company's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, reaching an annual run-rate of 1.5 million AV trips.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule in football to benefit the attacking team, which would involve the striker being onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is level with the defender. Wenger compared the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup. This change is suggested because with VAR, the advantage given to the striker disappeared, which can be frustrating for many people.</p>
