          <p>Juneteenth, observed annually on June 19th, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States and became a federal holiday in 2021. The name combines June and nineteenth, marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. While some celebrations may be smaller due to funding changes, communities continue to honor the holiday with parades, concerts, and educational events. Juneteenth symbolizes freedom and the resilience of Black communities, with its origins dating back to the arrival of Union soldiers in Galveston, Texas, to announce the freedom of over 250,000 enslaved people. </p>

Financial planners emphasize that high-yield savings accounts should not replace long-term investments like stocks and bonds.

          <p>The Florida Panthers have cracked and dented the Stanley Cup during their championship celebrations, adding to the trophy's long history of damage. The bowl of the Cup is cracked, and the bottom is dented, but the Hockey Hall of Fame plans to repair it before the celebration parade. Damage is common for the 131-year-old trophy, which has been submerged in water and mishandled by players and staff for over a century. Other teams, such as the Tampa Bay Lightning and Colorado Avalanche, have also damaged the Cup during their celebrations. </p>

          <h2>Senate Budget Bill Includes New Tax Break for Charitable Contributions</h2>

          <p>The Senate version of President Trump's budget bill includes a new tax break for charitable contributions, allowing non-itemizers to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly. This provision is a throwback to a similar rule from the CARES Act and aims to provide tax savings for individuals who may not currently deduct charitable giving. The bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, seeks to permanently extend the cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as introduce new tax breaks. This could offer some tax relief for those who donate to charity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Congestion Pricing in Manhattan Shows Early Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 08:57:40 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite initial opposition, congestion pricing in Manhattan is proving to be a success, with commuters experiencing significantly reduced travel times. The introduction of a $9 toll has led to improved traffic flow, prompting some initial skeptics to change their minds. Polls indicate growing support for the toll among New Yorkers, contrasting with staunch opposition prior to implementation. This suggests that the policy is effectively addressing congestion issues and gaining public acceptance. </p>
