          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased by 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. This success was largely attributed to a 36% jump in equities trading revenue, which generated $4.3 billion, and a 9% rise in fixed income trading, as market volatility from U.S. tariff policies benefited Wall Street activities. The strong results reflect a broader trend of positive earnings from other major banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in tone, a prominent Chinese state-run newspaper, the Economic Daily, has published an editorial supporting the country's internet platform companies. The article highlighted the importance of these firms, which provide services like food delivery, alongside "hard-tech" sectors such as aerospace and chip manufacturing. This change reflects Beijing's move towards a more favorable position on e-commerce and technology giants after a period of intense regulatory crackdowns. The editorial emphasized that innovations improving daily life are as crucial as breakthroughs in core "stranglehold technologies."</p>

          <p>Wang Huning, China's fourth-ranked official, has stressed the strategic importance of boosting domestic demand to ensure the nation's long-term economic health. Speaking at a political advisory meeting, he called for in-depth research and practical policy proposals that can be translated into "actionable results." This high-level focus on consumption comes as China's economy faces challenges in lifting domestic spending. The remarks precede a key Politburo meeting at the end of the month, where analysts anticipate the announcement of further demand-side stimulus measures.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed to "physician assistants" to clarify their roles. The report, commissioned by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, addresses concerns about patient safety and confusion, suggesting these professionals should wear distinct uniforms and see patients only under limited circumstances. The review follows high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The recommendations aim to establish a clearer framework for these roles within healthcare teams.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound as investor optimism grew around the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation in the U.S. House this week. Bitcoin increased by 2% and ether rose 3%, while related stocks like Circle and Coinbase also gained. The positive sentiment followed a temporary dip after a procedural snag delayed two crypto-related bills, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act. President Trump later indicated that several Republicans had reversed their opposition, boosting hopes that a regulatory framework for the industry is forthcoming, which could reduce market uncertainty.

          <p>The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a historic home run swing-off for the first time, with the National League securing a victory over the American League. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs on three swings to clinch the win. The new tie-breaking format, introduced in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, provided a dramatic conclusion to the event. Schwarber, who was named the game's MVP, overcame a two-homer deficit in the shootout to give the NL its first victory in the midsummer classic since 2012.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on airlines from Pakistan, allowing them to apply to resume flights after the country made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which came to light after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. The decision follows a similar move by the European Union's aviation safety agency earlier this year. Restoring these profitable routes is seen as a crucial step for the struggling state-owned PIA as it moves towards privatization.</p>

The author suggests that the event suffers from top players withdrawing and a format that has become less compelling over time. Proposed innovations include incorporating bat flips into the Home Run Derby to create more viral social media moments and adjusting the schedule to better accommodate players. The piece contends that to truly thrive, the game needs to ensure its best players are present and its format is fundamentally entertaining.</p>

Despite the downturn in Japan, the Cartier-owner's overall revenue rose 6% to €5.41 billion, slightly beating analyst expectations. The group's performance was bolstered by strong demand for its high-end jewelry brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, which saw sales rise 11%. However, the specialist watchmakers division continued to lag, reflecting a broader downturn in the luxury market. (not investment advice)</p>
