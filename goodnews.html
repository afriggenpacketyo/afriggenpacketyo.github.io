          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of rebuilding the UK's trade relationship with the European Union to benefit the British economy. He noted the fall-off in goods trade with the EU since Brexit and suggested that improving trade relations could positively impact inflation and overall economic openness. Bailey highlighted the recent US-UK trade agreement as an example of the importance of trade deals and their potential to rebuild the world trading system, while underscoring the need to ensure Brexit decisions do not damage the UK's long-term trade position.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is advising President Donald Trump not to raise taxes on wealthy Americans, cautioning against reversing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Pence argues that increasing the top margin rate would disproportionately affect small business owners who reinvest their earnings into their companies. He advocates for making all the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent to foster economic growth. Pence also credited Trump for his victory last November, securing the southern border, and restoring the military while expressing concerns about straying from conservative principles.</p>

          <p>Fox News co-host Jeanine Pirro is leaving the network to become the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following her appointment by President Trump. This decision comes after the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination due to concerns over his connections to Nazi sympathizers and defense of January 6th Capitol rioters. Pirro, a former district attorney and judge, will terminate her Fox News contract as is standard practice when nominated for a government role. Pirro's nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, is accompanied by her involvement in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Smartmatic.</p>

          <p>President Trump has replaced his controversial pick for U.S. attorney in D.C., Ed Martin, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, citing a lack of Senate support for Martin. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, faced criticism for demoting prosecutors involved in January 6th Capitol riot cases. Senator Thom Tillis expressed concerns about Martin's nomination due to his views on the Capitol riot, leading to Trump's decision to withdraw the nomination. Pirro's appointment as interim U.S. attorney resolves a thorny dilemma for the president, who said hours earlier that he would withdraw his nomination to permanently install the interim U.S. attorney, Ed Martin, under pressure from Senate Republicans.</p>

Her appointment resolves a dilemma for Trump, who needed to quickly fill the position before Martin's term expired. Pirro's past includes controversy, as she was named in a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for questioning the validity of ballot tabulations, which Fox News settled by acknowledging her statements were false.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines and must continue using a court-ordered map. The three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that flouted their directive to create a fair plan for Black voters. The judges said the 2023 map violated the Voting Rights Act by consigning Black voting strength to a single majority-Black district, and Alabama should have a second district with a substantial percentage of Black voters. The ruling came after a February trial and is expected to be appealed by the state.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer can claim a limited victory with the new trade deal with America, though political opponents accuse him of over claiming and adopting Trumpian hyperbole. The deal mitigates recent tariff increases, rather than representing a broad free trade agreement, but offers better trading conditions than recent times. The UK avoided diluting its Digital Services Tax and questions about the NHS or food standards. As industries pore over the specifics, Starmer can highlight this agreement as positive news, even if limited, amid international and domestic political challenges.</p>

The agreement will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slash tariffs on steel and aluminium. The two sides have also agreed to "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>
