          <p>President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill to influence House Republicans to support Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to pass a crucial bill. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" faces opposition from both conservatives and moderates, testing Johnson's leadership. Negotiations are ongoing to address concerns about Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Johnson remains optimistic about reaching a consensus, emphasizing the bottom-up approach in building consensus among lawmakers, as the bill is expected to go to the House floor for a vote on Thursday.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, deeming the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to dismantle the agency "null and void." Judge Beryl Howell stated that President Trump exceeded his constitutional authorities by disbanding the agency. The ruling reinstates the USIP board and allows the agency to resume its peacebuilding activities. The judge criticized DOGE's use of law enforcement and threats during the takeover, describing it as a "gross usurpation of power."</p>

These repeated outages have caused widespread delays and cancellations, exacerbating existing equipment and staffing issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said upgrades to the nation's air traffic control system are underway, with $12.5 billion allocated for modernization.</p>

          <p>With credit card balances remaining high and interest rates unlikely to decline materially soon, borrowers should re-evaluate their debt payoff strategies. Compounding interest makes it crucial to tackle credit card debt sooner rather than later. A variety of debt relief options exist, including debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and credit counseling, which can be tailored to individual circumstances. Depending on qualifications, some borrowers may be eligible for credit card debt forgiveness programs. (not investment advice)</p>
