The club plans to buy 50 shares of Palo Alto Networks and 75 shares of Starbucks, increasing its holdings in both companies. The rationale for the Starbucks purchase is the confirmed progress of its turnaround plan, while the Palo-Alto Networks buy is driven by the strategic value of its recent acquisition of CyberArk, despite initial market uncertainty. The article notes that trading was delayed due to rules restricting trades after a stock is mentioned on television. (not investment advice)</p>

The 22-year-old is reportedly in Paris for a medical after agreeing to a five-year contract with the European champions. The deal marks the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth this transfer window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez, generating substantial profit for the club. To fill the gap, Bournemouth has already agreed to a deal for Lille's Bafode Diakite for an initial fee of £30 million.</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC events, including marquee fights and "Fight Nights," will be available on the Paramount+ streaming service, with some events simulcast on CBS. This deal marks a shift away from the pay-per-view model previously used by ESPN+, as Paramount will not charge extra for the events. The acquisition of the year-round sports asset is seen as a strategic move by Paramount's new leadership to bolster its streaming content.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese aerospace engineers has developed a new stealth launcher designed to capture space debris without creating harmful vibrations or secondary fragments. The device uses a closed-gas mechanism that ignites a small charge to propel a projectile, such as a net, toward a target. Unlike conventional launchers, it produces no smoke or light, and a unique energy-absorbing ring near the muzzle mitigates the recoil, protecting the launch platform. While its stated purpose is for space cleanup, the technology's precision and stealth capabilities raise questions about its potential for dual-use as a weapon.</p>

          <p>The transfer of South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC is poised to significantly boost the profile of Major League Soccer in Asia. As one of the continent's biggest sports icons, Son's presence provides LAFC and the league a major platform to engage with Asian markets and brands, particularly from South Korea. While some fans initially wished for him to remain in a top European league, many now support his decision, which also makes sense ahead of the next World Cup. Marketing experts believe the move presents a massive opportunity for LAFC to expand its commercial reach through tours, partnerships, and digital content in the region.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will officially recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be formalized at the UN General Assembly in September. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations like France, Britain, and Canada that have signaled similar intentions. Albanese described the decision as a practical contribution towards a two-state solution, which he called "humanity's best hope" to end the conflict and the "humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza. The recognition is predicated on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no role for Hamas in government and the demilitarization of Gaza.</p>

          <p>Police in India have arrested six men accused of running a fake law enforcement agency called the "International Police and Crime Investigation Bureau" from an office in a New Delhi suburb. The suspects allegedly used a website, forged documents, and an office decorated with police-like logos to pose as officers and extort "donations" from victims. They also falsely claimed affiliations with Interpol and other international crime units. This incident follows another recent case near New Delhi where a man was arrested for running a fake embassy to defraud job seekers.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman States 'AGI' Is No Longer a Useful Term</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed that the term "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) is becoming less useful as AI capabilities advance rapidly. He noted that with multiple, shifting definitions, the concept of an AI that can perform any human intellectual task has become too vague. Instead of a binary "is it AGI or not?" distinction, Altman suggests it is more productive to think about continuous levels of progress in AI capability. Other experts agree, arguing the sci-fi-tinged term can be a distraction from the tangible, specialized progress being made and is often used as hype to drive funding.</p>

          <p>The generation of a Buddhist-style sutra by a chatbot has sparked a discussion about whether AI-written scripture can hold spiritual meaning. An expert prompted a chatbot to create the "Xeno Sutra," which, upon analysis, contained subtle concepts, rich imagery, and classic Buddhist ideas, rewarding a close reading. The article explores how different religious traditions might approach such texts, noting that non-dualistic faiths like Buddhism may be more receptive than Abrahamic religions focused on divine authorship. While AI can participate in meaning-making by remixing human wisdom, the article cautions about the risks of decontextualizing sacred ideas and the importance of human community in religious life.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Compulsory Eye Tests for Drivers Over 70</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 06:49:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is considering a major revision of driving laws that could require motorists over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests to remain on the road. This proposal is part of a new road safety strategy that also includes potentially lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's. The move follows a coroner's report which called the UK's reliance on driver self-reporting for vision problems the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government aims to address the nearly 1,600 annual road deaths with tougher, more proactive safety measures.</p>
