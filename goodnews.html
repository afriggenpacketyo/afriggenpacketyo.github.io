        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. Originally conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some criticize the cost and delays, others view the upgrade as a significant investment in the region's future, generating jobs and opportunities. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Cheaper Stockpiled Rice Hits Store Shelves Amidst High Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 02:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's stockpiled rice is now available in stores, offering consumers a cheaper alternative amidst soaring rice prices. Major retailers like Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama are selling 5-kilogram bags for 2,160 yen ($15), including tax. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening, reflecting high demand. The government aims to curb rice prices by selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers, hoping this approach will be more effective than previous auctions. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the weekend series against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe.

In Betts' absence, Miguel Rojas will take over at shortstop, with Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim also being options to fill in. Optimism score is 60.</p>
