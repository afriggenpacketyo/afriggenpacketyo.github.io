          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:51:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut to address a slowing labor market, marking the first reduction of the year. The Federal Open Market Committee's projections, known as the "dot plot," indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of 2025. This decision comes amidst significant political pressure from the White House and internal debate, with one governor dissenting in favor of a larger reduction. The Fed's statement highlighted rising downside risks to employment while acknowledging that inflation remains somewhat elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has offered a positive perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. She framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of “reglobalisation.” Despite the ongoing tariff battles, Okonjo-Iweala asserted that the WTO remains relevant, with nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operating under its rules. She acknowledged the system has been heavily disrupted but expressed excitement about the potential for positive change.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle has publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's assertion that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is dead. Biffle countered that the U.S. airline industry is currently facing an oversupply issue, not a problem with the discount model itself. His comments followed Kirby's prediction that rival Spirit Airlines would fail, calling Frontier the "last man standing on a sinking ship." Biffle defended his airline's lower operating costs and its role in serving budget-conscious travelers who might otherwise not fly.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest level in three years, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.13%. This significant decline is largely driven by market anticipation of the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut, which has caused yields on 10-year Treasury notes to slide. The lower rates have already triggered a surge in mortgage loan and refinancing applications from homeowners and prospective buyers. The article suggests that now may be an opportune moment for borrowers to lock in a lower rate before the market potentially shifts again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>With Interest Rates Falling, Long-Term CDs Offer a Way to Secure Higher Yields</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, savers may want to consider opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in currently available higher yields. As rates are expected to continue declining, a CD offers a guaranteed return that will not be affected by future cuts, unlike high-yield savings accounts with variable rates. By securing a multi-year CD now, savers can protect their earnings against further market changes and an unpredictable economic climate. Even with the recent dip, current long-term CD rates can still yield significant interest over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut to Affect Consumer Mortgages, Credit Cards, and Savings Accounts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point will have mixed effects on household finances. Consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, are likely to see their interest rates decrease in the near future. While the cut has already been factored into current mortgage rates, it may contribute to a gradual downward trend if more cuts follow. Conversely, savers will likely see yields on high-yield savings accounts and CDs drop, making it a less favorable environment for earning interest on deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open water for several days, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from major landmasses. However, meteorologists indicate that Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. While no immediate hazards to land have been announced, the system may approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, and its path remains under close observation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic drinks per day by eating naturally fermented ripe fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in figs and plums favored by the primates and calculated their daily intake. This finding lends support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our fruit-eating primate ancestors. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits that wild chimps routinely consume.</p>

          <p>Despite their success in the regular season, the primary objective for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami remains winning the MLS Cup, the league's championship title. While the Supporters' Shield for the best regular-season record is a significant achievement, the MLS Cup holds greater prestige and historical weight for the club and its fans. With Messi, now 38, nearing the end of his career, the urgency to secure this championship is high. The club's journey through the playoffs will be a major test, as regular-season success does not guarantee victory in the high-stakes knockout tournament.</p>

          <p>A sharp drop in mortgage rates to a multi-year low has triggered a massive 59.8% weekly surge in refinancing applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Homeowners who purchased homes in 2023 and 2024 at much higher rates are the primary group looking to benefit from the current average 30-year fixed rate of around 6.13%. The article notes that those with large loan balances, good credit, and plans to stay in their homes long-term are best positioned to save money by refinancing now. This trend reflects homeowner optimism about locking in lower long-term borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

These results move Eli Lilly closer to introducing a new, convenient, needle-free alternative in the highly competitive market for GLP-1 diabetes and obesity treatments.</p>
