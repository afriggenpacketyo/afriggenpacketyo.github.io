          <p>A sustained campaign of Ukrainian drone strikes has successfully disabled a significant portion of Russia's oil refining capacity, estimated at 15-20% of its total production. These attacks are creating domestic fuel shortages and pressuring the Kremlin's war economy by reducing crucial export revenue. European officials and military analysts believe this strategy of targeting Russia's strategic industries is an effective way to apply economic pressure and degrade Moscow's ability to wage war. The cumulative damage is becoming harder for Russia to repair due to sanctions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully contained a brush fire that broke out in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday evening, preventing it from damaging any homes. The fire burned approximately a quarter of an acre of vegetation on a steep hillside near Sunset Plaza Drive. About 80 firefighters, aided by water-dropping helicopters, were able to extinguish all active flames and stop the fire's forward progress within an hour. Although one car was burned, no structures were affected, and residents were instructed to shelter in place.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and marking the fastest growth rate since September of the previous year. The growth was primarily driven by strong domestic spending from both households and the government. This positive economic data comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates in August, citing a slightly clearer global trade outlook despite ongoing uncertainties. However, the central bank has slightly lowered its full-year growth forecast due to a weaker productivity outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed legislation requiring K-12 schools and public colleges to notify students, families, and staff when federal immigration enforcement agents are present on campus. The bill, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, is a direct response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies that have heightened fear in immigrant communities. Proponents argue the measure is crucial for student safety and well-being, ensuring schools remain a secure place for learning. If signed, the law would take effect immediately and remain in place until 2031.</p>

          <p>The recent craze for Pop Mart's Labubu dolls is seen as an early sign of a broader 'branding supercycle' in China, where brand trust is becoming as important as hardware. This trend is expanding beyond consumer goods into industrial sectors like electric vehicle batteries from CATL and cars from BYD and Xiaomi. This shift indicates Chinese companies are moving from a cost-advantage model to a brand-advantage model, where components and industrial products become recognized and requested by name, reflecting a significant change in the global business landscape.

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully escaped a domestic violence incident by using a hand signal popularized on social media to alert a bystander for help. The witness at a 7-Eleven recognized the discrete gesture—tucking the thumb into the palm and closing the fingers over it—and called 911. Police responded quickly and arrested the suspect, a convicted felon who had an active warrant and was in possession of a stun gun. The 'Signal for Help' was created by the Canadian Women's Foundation in 2020 to aid abuse survivors.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B of assault and battery in a civil lawsuit filed by a security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, had alleged the rapper spat on her and cut her with a fingernail during a 2018 confrontation at an obstetrician's office when Cardi B's pregnancy was not yet public. The jury deliberated for only an hour before finding the rapper not liable. Following the verdict, Cardi B stated she works hard for her money and warned against frivolous lawsuits.</p>

          <p>A federal judge indicated that the rapid rise of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT significantly altered the course of the U.S. Department of Justice's landmark antitrust case against Google. While Google lost the case last year, the judge ruled against the most severe penalty of breaking up the company, noting the AI landscape is 'highly competitive' with numerous new entrants. This new competitive dynamic, which didn't exist when the case was filed in 2020, was a key reason Google was allowed to keep its Chrome browser.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, can resume her duties, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to fire her. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, upholding nearly a century of legal precedent designed to insulate the agency from partisan politics. Slaughter, who was fired along with another Democratic commissioner in March, expressed eagerness to return to her work on behalf of American consumers. The ruling is a significant check on presidential power over independent regulatory agencies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ordered remedies in the landmark antitrust case against Google, ruling that the tech giant will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. However, Google will be barred from entering into exclusive default search engine contracts and must share certain search and user interaction data with competitors. The decision is seen as a partial victory for Google, as it avoids the most severe structural penalties sought by the Department of Justice. The ruling acknowledges the intense competition brought by the rise of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, 'Power and the Palace,' reveals that Queen Camilla fought off a sexual assault on a train as a teenager in the 1960s and had the perpetrator arrested. The account, reportedly told by Camilla to Boris Johnson in 2008, is one of several claims in the book by author Valentine Low. Other anecdotes include insights into the late Queen Elizabeth II's private opposition to Brexit and tense negotiations over the Sovereign Grant. A source close to the Queen hopes the story's publication can empower others to speak out against abuse.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava up to 330 feet high from its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 32nd eruptive episode since the current activity began in December 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed that all lava flow has so far been contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists are continuously monitoring the volcano, which has a history of both contained summit eruptions and more destructive flows from lower-elevation vents.</p>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's decision on remedies in its antitrust case.

While Google must share some search data and is barred from certain exclusive contracts, the financial penalties were seen as manageable. The outcome suggests the market believes Google's core business model will remain largely intact despite the monopoly finding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's stock saw a significant rise after a federal judge ruled that Google can continue its lucrative practice of paying to be the default search engine on devices like the iPhone. The decision was part of the remedy phase in Google's antitrust lawsuit, where a ban on these multi-billion dollar payments was a potential outcome. The continuation of this deal is crucial for Apple's high-margin services division revenue. The ruling, while placing some new restrictions on exclusivity, preserves a key financial partnership between the two tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a scathing ruling declaring that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen in Los Angeles in June was a 'serious violation' of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The judge found that the administration knowingly worked to circumvent the law by claiming a 'constitutional exception' to justify the operation. This ruling rebukes the administration's legal reasoning and sets a precedent that could impact its plans to deploy troops in other cities like Chicago.</p>
