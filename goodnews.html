          <p>England is set to face France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final at Ashton Gate in Bristol. As tournament hosts and the world's top-ranked team, England are the clear favorites, boasting a 16-match winning streak against their French rivals. The Red Roses have demonstrated formidable power throughout the tournament, extending their world-record winning run to 31 matches after a decisive quarter-final victory over Scotland. The winner of this clash will advance to the final at Twickenham to play Canada, who secured their place by defeating defending champions New Zealand.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high, as investors assessed the economic outlook following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The rise in long-term yields is somewhat counterintuitive, as the Fed's move was intended to ease financial conditions. However, investors in longer-term debt are also weighing factors like future economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to sell more debt to finance spending. The market's reaction suggests some investors believe the economy may be stronger than previously thought, potentially tempering the need for further aggressive rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly addressed reports that he collaborates on game plans with team minority owner Tom Brady, stating that their discussions are not a weekly occurrence. Kelly clarified that while he has used Brady as a valuable resource, talking with him about football philosophy and strategies against certain defenses, the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not involved in the team's weekly game planning. The clarification comes after an ESPN sideline report during "Monday Night Football" suggested a more formal and frequent collaboration. The NFL has confirmed that Brady's presence in the coaches' booth during games is permissible under his status as a limited partner.</p>

The successful debut is another positive sign for the tech IPO market, which has seen a resurgence after a prolonged quiet period. However, the company acknowledged significant risks in its prospectus, including its heavy reliance on Amazon and uncertainties related to global trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research indicates that U.S. electricity demand is set to grow significantly over the next five years, driven largely by the power requirements of new AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, signaling a strong and sustained investment trend. This outlook is particularly bullish for industrial companies like GE Vernova, which manufactures power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which produces essential electrical equipment for the grid and data centers. The high demand and limited production capacity, especially for gas turbines, are expected to maintain favorable pricing and profit margins for these firms. (not investment advice)</p>

Visitors can once again climb the 424 stairs to experience panoramic views of Paris and see the famous gargoyles up close. The cathedral itself reopened in December 2024 and has already attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily. The successful, near-$1 billion restoration fulfills Macron's promise to complete the project within five years, representing a remarkable achievement in architectural and cultural preservation.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations providing key details on President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but the guidance clarifies which occupations qualify and what constitutes a deductible tip. Notably, workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, are not eligible for the deduction. Furthermore, the agencies confirmed that automatic or mandatory gratuities do not qualify as tips because they are not given voluntarily by the customer, which will exclude a significant portion of service charges from the tax break.</p>

          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several cost-effective options for borrowing money. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is currently one of the cheapest methods, with average rates below those of home equity loans and personal loans, and significantly lower than record-high credit card rates. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed interest rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that does not put a borrower's home at risk as collateral. With the potential for future rate cuts, variable-rate products like HELOCs may become even more affordable, offering relief to borrowers after years of high interest rates.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, arguing that a central theme throughout his work was the hollowness of easy victory and the corrupting nature of success. From his iconic roles as athletes in films like "Downhill Racer" and "The Natural" to his directorial work on "Quiz Show," Redford consistently explored the idea that winning is often a perilous deception. He believed American culture was obsessed with victory at all costs, a concept he sought to deconstruct through his art. Redford's legacy is defined not just by his on-screen charisma but by his intelligent and critical examination of competition and the true meaning of triumph.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking significant steps to win back the lucrative liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping trade that it lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG tankers next year and are developing a new 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus as an alternative to canal transits. This "Interoceanic Energy Corridor" would free up vessel slots and provide more flexibility for energy companies. These initiatives aim to address the decline in LNG traffic, which has persisted even as water levels have improved, and to solidify the canal's role in global energy logistics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet federal court standards. The judge described the filing as repetitive, superfluous, and more of a political document intended to "rage against an adversary" than a proper legal claim. The lawsuit, which also named the publisher Penguin Random House, accused the newspaper of being a "mouthpiece" for Democrats. While the judge struck down the current suit, Trump has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to the court's procedural rules.</p>

          <p>Recent images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured during a total lunar eclipse, show it emitting a distinct green glow, a phenomenon that is currently puzzling astronomers. Typically, a comet's green color is caused by the fluorescence of dicarbon (C2) molecules as it heats up near the Sun. However, observations of 3I/ATLAS have so far revealed very few signs of this molecule, suggesting its chemical composition is unusual. Scientists speculate that either the dicarbon has not yet been detected or another, unknown molecule is responsible for the green hue, indicating that the interstellar visitor still holds significant secrets about its origins.</p>

Sable has denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated. The charges add another legal hurdle for the company, which has already faced opposition from state regulators over its plans to reactivate pipelines, including one that caused a major oil spill in 2015.</p>

In September 2025, several Western nations including the UK, Canada, and France announced plans to formally recognize Palestine, a move that has angered Israeli officials who argue it rewards terrorism. While Palestine holds non-member observer status at the United Nations, its bid for full membership was blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. The recent trend, accelerated by the ongoing conflict in Gaza, reflects increasing international support for a two-state solution, though key powers like the U.S. and Germany have not yet extended formal recognition.</p>
