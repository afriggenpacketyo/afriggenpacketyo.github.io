        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing market expectations. The company's success is attributed to the surging demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. This strong performance has solidified its position as a global leader in the HBM space, notably as a key supplier to AI giant Nvidia. The article highlights how SK Hynix has maintained its edge over competitors like Samsung and Micron in this lucrative market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:37:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, a stronger-than-expected performance that allowed the nation to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which reversed a contraction from the previous quarter, was primarily driven by a rebound in total consumption and a strong increase in exports. Shipments of key products like semiconductors and petroleum products showed significant gains. The positive economic data comes as South Korea navigates sensitive trade negotiations with the United States and as its central bank maintains interest rates to ensure financial stability.

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to specifically request and be matched with women drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," is designed to address safety concerns and preferences that female riders and drivers have expressed. Women drivers can also opt-in to a preference for female riders. While the company acknowledges that wait times may be longer for this option due to the smaller number of female drivers, the initiative builds on similar successful programs Uber has implemented in 40 other countries.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will run for re-election to his Hudson Valley House seat, ending speculation that he would launch a bid for New York governor against incumbent Kathy Hochul. Lawler stated that keeping the Republican House majority is critical, emphasizing that his seat was a key factor in determining control of the chamber in past elections. His decision narrows the field of potential GOP challengers to Hochul, with Rep. Elise Stefanik now seen as a more likely contender, and keeps a prominent Republican in a highly competitive congressional district.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially unveiled its AI Action Plan, a comprehensive strategy aimed at ensuring U.S. leadership in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. The plan's major pillars include expediting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants by modernizing permitting processes.

          <p>A new comprehensive analysis published in The Lancet Public Health journal suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with significant health benefits, offering a more achievable target than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. The research, which reviewed dozens of past studies, found that a 7,000-step daily count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and substantial reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to more sedentary individuals. The authors propose this number as a practical and clinically meaningful public health goal.</p>

          <p>Comments from In-N-Out Burger's billionaire owner, Lynsi Snyder, about leaving California for Tennessee sparked a wave of online speculation that the iconic chain was relocating its headquarters. Snyder cited the difficulty of raising a family and doing business in the Golden State. However, the company has since clarified that while Snyder is moving personally, the corporate headquarters will remain in Southern California, where the business was founded. The incident nonetheless triggered a culture-war debate and left some loyal California customers feeling slighted by the owner's remarks.</p>

          <p>The word "OK," one of the most universally understood terms on the planet, has its roots in a playful 19th-century American trend of jocular misspellings. Scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as an abbreviation for "oll korrect." The term was then widely popularized during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname was "Old Kinderhook." His supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," cementing the phrase in the American lexicon, from where it spread globally through technology and culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of primary residences. Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to the tax. The proposal, which was recently introduced in a House bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is intended to boost the housing market by encouraging homeowners, especially seniors in high-value areas, to sell without facing a large tax penalty. The potential cost and congressional support for the measure remain unclear. (not investment advice)</p>
