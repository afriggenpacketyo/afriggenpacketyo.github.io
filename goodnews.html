          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal that sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, avoiding a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies entering the U.S. market, particularly in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal lowers duties on key exports like autos, it excludes concessions on steel, aluminum, and copper, which face 50% tariffs. The agreement highlights the complex interpretations of investment profits and strategic negotiations amid broader U.S. trade policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill, AB 379, into law, which increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. This "wobbler" provision was a compromise after initial concerns from some Democrats that a blanket felony charge could harm victims or be used to profile minorities. The law also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for Democratic values. Sources close to Harris indicated she seriously considered the role but ultimately felt she could have a greater impact on the national stage. This decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign, a possibility she has not ruled out.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, generated tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. The event prompted evacuation orders and warnings in Hawaii, Japan, and along the U.S. West Coast, though most were later downgraded to advisories as the risk of major damage appeared to pass. Flooding was reported in Russia near the epicenter, and small waves and minor flooding occurred in Hawaii and parts of California. While the immediate threat has subsided in many areas, authorities in some South American countries issued new warnings.</p>

          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport. Their plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The group claims their proposal would reduce risk and costs compared to the plan from Heathrow's own operators, estimating a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted, introducing a new dynamic to the long-debated infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue, which surged 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The growth was driven by a significant increase in funded customers, total platform assets, and net interest revenue. The company is successfully expanding beyond retail trading into wealth management, attracting new clients with deposit matches and growing its retirement account assets. Despite the positive results, shares dipped slightly after the company forecast higher operating expenses for 2025 due to acquisition costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani caused concern when he left his pitching start in the fourth inning against the Cincinnati Reds, but the team later announced the issue was only cramping. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, though he remained in the game as a designated hitter. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, but the primary focus was the relief that Ohtani's injury was not serious. He is expected to make his next scheduled start, providing a positive outcome on an otherwise disappointing night for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The decision came as new data showed the economy grew 3% in the second quarter, largely due to a drop in imports caused by tariffs, but underlying indicators suggest a loss of momentum. In an unusual move, two Fed board members dissented, favoring a rate cut, signaling a potential broadening of support for future reductions. The Fed remains cautious, balancing a stable job market against the uncertain economic effects of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science of tsunamis. They are typically generated by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes with vertical tectonic plate movement, which displaces a massive volume of water. In the deep ocean, the waves travel as fast as a jet but are often unnoticeably low; they slow down and grow dangerously high as they approach shallower coastal waters. Predicting their exact size and impact remains challenging, and experts stress the importance of heeding all evacuation warnings immediately, as even small-looking waves can carry immense destructive power.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has observed and documented abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The team discovered fields of tube worms, clam beds, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities are more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing and complex debate about the effects of screen time on children, questioning the narrative that it is uniformly harmful. Some scientists argue that concrete evidence for negative outcomes is lacking and that many studies rely on flawed self-reporting data, failing to distinguish between different types of screen use. Others maintain that increased screen time correlates with rising depression rates and reduced sleep, advocating for parents to delay smartphone access. The piece highlights the lack of clear scientific consensus and official guidance, leaving parents to navigate a judgmental and uncertain landscape.</p>

The images revealed sophisticated and intricate designs of animals and mythical creatures that were not visible to the naked eye. The quality of the tattoos, which include leopards and a griffin, suggests advanced techniques and a significant cultural practice among the ancient nomadic people. By collaborating with a modern tattooist specializing in ancient methods, the team gained new insights into how these complex decorations were likely created.</p>

Witherspoon is embracing his role as a mentor to younger players and sees the team's decision not to add new cornerbacks as a vote of confidence in the current group.
