          <h2>Photo Exhibit Highlights Courage of Women Facing Tropical Disease in Madagascar</h2>

          <p>A photo exhibit titled 'Sahy Rano' by photographer Miora Rajaonary showcases the courage of eight women in Madagascar who are raising awareness about female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, leads to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and genital ulcers, often causing shame and suspicion due to STD-like symptoms. The women in the exhibit wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their bravery in speaking about the disease, while Rajaonary uses painted backdrops and laundry ropes to symbolize the water's presence in their lives. Razanaparana, one of the women featured, contracted FGS while working in rice fields and faced abandonment by her husband due to the symptoms, highlighting the severe social impact of the disease. The exhibit aims to break taboos and promote public awareness about FGS and its impact on women's lives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 09:21:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The court's decision supports the separation of church and state, arguing that the mandate would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling, believing it only applies to specific districts and plans to appeal, potentially taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are facing challenges, with legal experts anticipating the Supreme Court will ultimately address the issue of religion in government.</p>

          <p>Former Indiana Pacers star Jalen Rose confidently predicts a Pacers victory in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Rose emphasizes the importance of Tyrese Haliburton's health, stating that if Haliburton is ready to play, Indiana will win the game. The Pacers and Thunder are closely matched, with Oklahoma City having outscored Indiana by only seven points throughout the entire series. A win for the Pacers would secure their first NBA championship, while a win for Oklahoma City would mark their first title since 1979.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples should take a compatibility test to avoid potential "deal-breakers" later in the relationship. The expert and her husband created a list of questions based on relationship science principles to determine their compatibility before committing to a long-term relationship. Unlike generic questions found on dating apps, the list should be tailored to the specific couple's needs and values. The main themes to focus on include finances, family, lifestyle, and future goals, ensuring open communication and understanding between partners.</p>

          <p>Air conditioning is essential for the modern world, offering benefits that extend beyond mere comfort, including saving lives by preventing heat-related deaths. It also boosts productivity by maintaining optimal working conditions, helps people sleep better, and enables various industries, from movie theaters to microchip manufacturing. Moreover, air conditioning has allowed millions to live and travel in previously uninhabitable hot climates. While current air conditioning technology has environmental drawbacks, the focus should be on improving efficiency and using cleaner energy sources to maximize its benefits in an ever-warming world.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with a history of heart troubles, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant after her heart function continued to decline despite having an LVAD. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, proposed the procedure to address her high antibody levels, which increased the risk of organ rejection. The liver transplant was intended to help lower the antibodies, and the procedure was successful. Baker's surgery has paved the way for other patients with similar conditions to receive life-saving treatment.</p>
