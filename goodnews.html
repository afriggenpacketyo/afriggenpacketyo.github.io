        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs outfielder Ian Happ made a significant baserunning mistake in the first inning. After hitting a single, Happ ran from first base on a fly ball hit by a teammate, reaching second base before the ball was caught. On his retreat to first base, he failed to retouch the second base bag, a required action in baseball rules. The Cardinals successfully appealed the play, resulting in a double play that ended the inning, a rare blunder for the veteran player. Despite the error, the Cubs went on to win the game 3-0.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and other traditional foods. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between this diet and improved mental well-being. The institute noted that specific foods like seaweed, soy, and oily fish contain nutrients that can assist in releasing mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn criticism toward the management of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's office. One inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a collective reward of $50,000 offered for information leading to his arrest. At least 16 people have also been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>The Japanese fruit sandwich, or "furutsu sando," has made its way to the UK high street, with retailer M&S launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. This snack, popular in Japan and recently viral on social media, typically consists of soft white bread, whipped cream, and fresh fruit. The M&S sandwich quickly became its top-selling variety after its launch, indicating a strong public reception. While fruit sandwiches might seem unusual to some, the concept builds on other British staples like banana or jam sandwiches, sparking a wider conversation about what defines a sandwich.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the creators and stars of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," are preparing for a second series that delves even deeper into dark and taboo subjects. The show, written by Sadler, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial and relationship struggles with a bleakly humorous perspective. The first series addressed topics like mental health and abortion with an unconventional, edgy tone. Sadler says the new series is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and will continue to satirize contemporary issues from a distinctly female viewpoint.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent explored the potential of bacteriophages, or phages, which are viruses that prey on bacteria, as a viable alternative to antibiotics. In an experiment with the Phage Collection Project, a phage collected from the correspondent's own toilet was found to be effective at killing a persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. This century-old science is gaining renewed interest as the world faces a growing crisis of antibiotic resistance, which is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. While challenges remain in bringing phage therapy into mainstream medicine, it offers a promising avenue for treating incurable superbugs.</p>

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan struck down the order against the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it a violation of the Constitution and an attack on the right to legal counsel. This is the latest in a series of judicial rebukes against the administration's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. The targeted firms have successfully argued that the orders, which impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances, violate their First and Fifth Amendment rights.</p>

His comment was interpreted by some, including AI chatbot Grok, as a reference to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization potentially reaching $100 trillion. This highly bullish sentiment is shared by other analysts, such as Julien Bittel of Global Macro Investor, who believes mass crypto adoption could drive the market cap to that astronomical figure within the next decade. For context, the total crypto market cap currently stands at just over $3 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match in Barbados, with bowler Josh Hazlewood playing a pivotal role. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the final session of day three, losing all ten of their wickets as they chased a target of 301 runs. Hazlewood was the chief destroyer, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the West Indies' top order during a crucial spell. Despite some late resistance from Justin Greaves and Shamar Joseph, Australia's bowlers wrapped up the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, increasing the fund to $750 million from $330 million. The move, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, is designed to keep production local and reverse the trend of filming moving to other states and countries that offer more generous incentives. Industry unions and professionals have applauded the decision, calling it a crucial step to support workers and bring production back home. The entertainment industry has seen a significant decline in local jobs and production activity in recent years.</p>
