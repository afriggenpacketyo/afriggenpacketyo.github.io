Cricket is similar to baseball, with a bat and ball, but the bowler tries to hit the wicket behind the batsman. Runs are scored by hitting the ball across the boundary or running between the pitches. A super over is a tie-breaker where each team bowls six balls to score the most runs. India is favored over the United States in their upcoming match.</p>

Lower inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which could make other investments more appealing compared to gold.

The artificial intelligence feature is being tested directly beneath the Google search bar beside a "Google Search" button, replacing the "I'm Feeling Lucky" widget. The new feature, though not widely available yet, is being tested in a location where Google rarely makes changes.</p>
