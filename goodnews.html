          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, was forced to return to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas after flames and smoke were observed coming from its left engine shortly after takeoff. The flight, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, landed safely without any reported injuries. While initial reports suggested an engine fire, a subsequent inspection by American Airlines maintenance teams found no evidence of a fire. The aircraft, an Airbus A321, has been taken out of service for further evaluation, and the FAA will conduct an investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Emily Eavis, organizer of Glastonbury Festival, describes the special atmosphere of the festival's first two days, particularly the "Thursday feeling" of excitement and anticipation. She notes that the site typically reaches capacity on Thursday afternoon, creating a palpable sense of community as friends reunite. Eavis shares memories of opening the gates with her father, Michael Eavis, and witnessing the cheer and determination in the eyes of festival-goers. The festival, which began in 1970, has evolved over the years but retains the same magical essence of community and excitement.</p>

          <p>A controversial project to create artificial human DNA from scratch has commenced, marking a potential breakthrough in biology. The Wellcome Trust has provided initial funding for the Synthetic Human Genome Project, despite ethical concerns about designer babies and unforeseen consequences. Researchers aim to develop therapies for age-related diseases and generate disease-resistant cells for damaged organs. Critics fear the research could be misused for unethical purposes, but proponents argue it holds immense potential for advancing medical treatments and understanding human genetics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have developed a test to identify women with abnormal womb linings, increasing their risk of miscarriage and paving the way for new treatments. The test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining, which is being piloted to help over 1,000 patients. In some women with a history of miscarriage, the womb lining doesn't react properly, failing to transform into a supportive environment for the embryo. The findings offer a potential explanation for recurrent miscarriage and provide hope for improved pregnancy outcomes.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter released an alternative album cover for her forthcoming album, ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Best Friend,‚Äù in response to backlash over the original artwork. The initial cover, which depicted Carpenter on all fours like a dog with a man pulling her hair, sparked criticism for allegedly promoting sexist stereotypes. The alternative cover features a black-and-white image of Carpenter in an elegant gown leaning against a man in a suit, seemingly channeling Marilyn Monroe. Carpenter has previously faced controversy for her music video filmed at a church and her suggestive performances on tour.</p>

          <p>The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Mars' proposed acquisition of Kellanova, the maker of Pringles, citing concerns about potential price hikes for consumers.
