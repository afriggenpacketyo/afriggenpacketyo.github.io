        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, Hong Kong firms are being encouraged to proactively implement safe AI practices to mitigate security and privacy risks. The use of AI systems often involves collecting and processing personal data, which raises concerns about excessive collection, unauthorized use, and potential data breaches. International declarations and resolutions, including the Bletchley Declaration and the UN's resolution on AI, emphasize the importance of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. China has also stressed the need for both development and security in technological innovation, promoting a people-centered approach to AI governance.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases prior to the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures to raise ¬£3-4 billion annually, including increasing corporation tax on banks and extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. The Labour party is having discussions about raising funds rather than cutting benefits, as some Labour MPs have expressed unease about cuts to welfare announced at the Spring Statement.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to support a sweeping bill aimed at advancing his domestic agenda, as party leaders negotiated with holdouts to secure their votes. Trump urged Republicans to embrace the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, emphasizing that it was a test of loyalty. Despite initial resistance, Speaker Mike Johnson made progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations, addressing concerns from various factions. The bill encompasses tax cuts, increased military spending, and changes to Medicaid, requiring careful concessions to satisfy different Republican groups. The White House views the bill's passage as crucial for fulfilling Trump's campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper's recent performance at the Madrid Open has highlighted British tennis players' potential on clay courts, a surface where they have historically struggled. While Andy Murray reached the French Open final in 2016, Sue Barker remains the last British singles champion in Paris, dating back to 1976. Last year, all six British singles competitors were eliminated in the first round, marking the third such occurrence this century. The article poses the question of what skills and attributes are necessary for success on clay, a surface that demands unique strategies and physical endurance.</p>

          <p>Tributes have been paid by the cast of US comedy series Cheers after George Wendt - who starred as Norm Peterson - died at the age of 76. Ted Danson, who played bar boss Sam Malone, said he was "devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us". Kelsey Grammer, who played Frasier Crane before starring in his own spin-off, said in a statement to Deadline: "I believe mourning is a private matter. But I liked George a lot. He was beloved by millions." Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers, which ran from 1982 to 93.

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed an immunity to multiple types of venom. His experiences have prompted researchers to explore the possibility of creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions of people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers hope to synthesize a treatment from Friede's blood that could neutralize toxins from various snake bites. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with specific venoms to produce antibodies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism from some in the Maga movement, who view him as a continuation of Pope Francis's progressive policies. However, the article argues that the new pope's approach may be more challenging for Catholic Maga figures, particularly those who have used their faith to justify nationalist policies. Pope Leo's choice of name signals a recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, and his focus on issues like inequality, climate change, and migration suggests a critique of the Maga worldview. The article suggests that Pope Leo will challenge the insular nationalism and authoritarian tendencies of the Maga movement.</p>
