          <p>A new gene therapy has shown significant promise in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75%, bringing immense hope to affected families. For Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed in 2011, this breakthrough is life-changing, offering the prospect of growing old together. While the therapy is still in early stages and faces regulatory hurdles for NHS approval, it represents a crucial step forward for a devastating condition that previously had no treatment options. Scientists believe this approach could also have broader implications for other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning ideas, once controversial, are now inspiring the next generation of new towns in England, with government announcements expected soon. These developments will emphasize walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" housing, reflecting the King's traditional town-building philosophy. TV architect George Clarke notes a shift in mainstream architectural thought, embracing designs sensitive to local places and public preferences, moving away from past "ego-driven" brutalist structures. The goal is to create communities with high-quality homes, public spaces, and improved local services, learning from the shortcomings of post-war new towns.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio has launched "Men's Work," a program led by Johnny Cole of Hey Brother and teacher David Reese, offering teen boys a unique forum to openly discuss their emotional struggles and the complexities of modern masculinity. This initiative addresses the challenge many boys face in expressing their feelings, with only 38% comfortable discussing mental health with friends. The program aims to counteract harmful messaging from the "manosphere" by fostering a supportive environment where young men can explore identity, strength, and emotional well-being in a healthier way.</p>

          <p>Nine-year-old Jameson Pennings, a Philadelphia Phillies fan, displayed remarkable generosity by gifting a foul ball he caught to Donna Morey, a fellow fan celebrating her 80th birthday. Jameson overheard Morey's daughter trying to get a ball for her, realizing an elderly fan's chances were slim. He approached her with his prized possession, explaining he could attend more games and get other balls. Morey was deeply touched by the unexpected act of kindness, which she described as symbolizing "goodness in this world."</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has long captivated public interest. While many believe Earhart's plane ran out of fuel and crashed, various unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged the declassification, citing firsthand accounts of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. Experts, however, largely dismiss the spy theory, attributing her disappearance to a fuel shortage and inadequate preparation for the challenging flight.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts are examining how Hong Kong's role as a "superconnector" between the mainland and global markets could evolve. Despite past doubts, Hong Kong's stock index rise, fundraising surge, and appeal to global businesses indicate its resilience. Its position in Beijing's blueprint will significantly influence policies and resources directed its way. Experts suggest the special administrative region could strengthen its unique economic function, as its trajectory has historically been shaped by Beijing's high-level policy decisions.</p>
