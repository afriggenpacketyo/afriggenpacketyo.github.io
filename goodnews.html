          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.75%, providing some relief for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend occurred despite the Federal Reserve holding its key interest rate steady, highlighting the influence of other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield. However, whether this decline will continue through July is uncertain and may depend on upcoming inflation data and future signals from the Fed. Analysts suggest that lenders might begin lowering their rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, after a passenger's portable battery pack caught fire in the cabin. Flight attendants successfully extinguished the flames, but the plane was diverted out of an abundance of caution due to residual smoke. All 185 customers and six crew members landed safely with no injuries reported. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which is the latest in a growing number of events involving lithium-ion battery fires on aircraft, prompting some airlines to introduce new safety policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has agreed to acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly expand CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of Core Scientific's U.S. data center footprint. Core Scientific, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has been shifting its focus toward high-performance computing. The acquisition will allow CoreWeave to either divest Core Scientific's crypto mining business or convert those sites for AI workloads, bolstering its competition with major cloud providers.</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, is expanding its operations by beginning to test its vehicles in Philadelphia. The initial phase will involve a limited fleet of cars operating with human safety drivers behind the wheel to collect mapping data and assess the technology's performance in the city's unique urban environment. This "road trip" is a standard step for Waymo as it evaluates new locations for potential paid ride-sharing services. The expansion comes as Waymo aims for a broader rollout of its services, which are already active in several other major U.S. cities.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Article Parodies Workplace Trend Reporting by Chronicling a 'Day in the Life of a Gen Z Worker'</h2>

          <p>In a satirical piece, The Atlantic critiques the media's breathless reporting on so-called Gen Z workplace trends by humorously rebranding everyday activities with buzzword-laden names. The article follows a fictional Gen Z worker through a typical day, describing sleep as a "Microdeath," commuting without internet as a "Tiny Detox," and taking a lunch break as a "Microvacation." The piece playfully mocks the alarmist tone often used to describe mundane behaviors like talking to colleagues ("Voice Quitting") or breathing ("Lung Bathe"). It ultimately satirizes the way normal work-life phenomena are often framed as dramatic, new generational trends.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood by artist Louie Palsino honors Dodgers utility player Kiké Hernández for his public stance in support of immigrants. The artwork was inspired by an Instagram post from Hernández in which he expressed his anger over immigration raids and stated his support for the Los Angeles community that adopted him as one of its own. The mural features Hernández's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles." It is located on a building that already features Palsino's murals of Dodgers legends Vin Scully and Fernando Valenzuela, cementing Hernández's place in the city's culture.</p>

          <p>One month into his return as a two-way player for the Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani is demonstrating both his pitching prowess and his powerful hitting. While still building up his endurance on the mound after his second Tommy John surgery, he has been effective in limited innings, with his fastball consistently exceeding 100 mph. At the plate, he continues to post MVP-caliber numbers, leading the National League in home runs and slugging percentage. While his batting average has seen a slight dip, the team remains impressed with how he is managing the dual responsibilities and progressing in his recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated in the coming months, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) are advised to take preparatory steps now. Financial experts suggest prospective borrowers should check their credit reports, work on improving their credit scores, and compare offers from multiple lenders to establish a baseline. It is also crucial to calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios, as HELOCs have variable rates. Taking these actions can better position homeowners to secure favorable terms when rates eventually drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chicxs Rockerxs, a summer camp for girls and gender-nonconforming youth in Southeast Los Angeles, canceled its in-person program and moved entirely online to protect its community from the escalating ICE raids in the area.

          <h2>California Progresses on Conservation Goals Amidst Federal Threats to Public Lands</h2>

          <p>California is on track to meet its "30x30" goal of conserving 30% of its land and coastal waters by 2030, having now protected 26.1% of lands and 21.9% of waters. Recent progress was significantly boosted by the federal designation of the Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands national monuments. However, state officials worry that the Trump administration's opposition to conservation, including threats to rescind these monument designations, could reverse these gains. The initiative aims to restore biodiversity and combat climate change, but its success remains partially dependent on federal cooperation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified the oldest known pterosaur fossil in North America from a fragile jawbone discovered in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The flying reptile, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, was about the size of a small seagull and lived approximately 209 million years ago during the late Triassic period. The discovery, detailed in a Smithsonian-led paper, helps fill a significant gap in the fossil record and provides new insights into the evolution of these early flying animals. The fossil was unearthed from a rich bone bed that has yielded thousands of other important Triassic fossils.</p>
