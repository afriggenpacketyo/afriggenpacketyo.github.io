        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike will once again sell its products directly on Amazon in the U.S., marking a return after a six-year absence due to concerns about counterfeit goods. Nike aims to enhance customer experience and broaden its reach by leveraging Amazon's marketplace. Amazon will source a wider variety of Nike products, although Nike will remain a "gated" brand to prevent the sale of counterfeit items. This deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it seeks to attract more high-end brands to its platform, expanding its luxury fashion offerings. </p>
