          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people in 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents had fewer or expected to have fewer children than they wanted. Financial limitations were cited as a major factor, with 39% of respondents globally identifying it as a barrier. The article emphasizes the shift in focus towards low fertility issues and the challenges individuals face in achieving their desired family size.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl-related deaths among people under 35 have decreased significantly from 2021 to 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. Despite this progress, addiction remains a severe issue for many, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services pose a threat to sustaining this positive trend. The article highlights the positive impact of harm reduction strategies and changing attitudes towards drug use among young people.</p>
