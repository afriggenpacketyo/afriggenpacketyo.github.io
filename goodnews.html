          <p>President Trump touted a tariffs agreement with the UK at the G7 summit, displaying the deal alongside Prime Minister Starmer. The agreement removes tariffs on the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, averting potential job losses. While the UK is exempt from the global 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding proof of origin. The deal also includes reciprocal access to beef sales between the two countries; this agreement is an achievement for the Prime Minister on the international stage despite Trump's unorthodox approach. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5%. The decision, which aligns with economist expectations, signals concerns about economic growth amid persistent inflation. The central bank aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets while maintaining stability. Japan's economy faces uncertainty, with inflation remaining above the BOJ's target for three years and GDP shrinking recently due to declining exports. (not investment advice)</p>
