          <h2>How a Putting Coach and a New Putter Transformed Scottie Scheffler's Game</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:30:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season, including seven PGA tour wins and a second Masters title, is credited to a dramatic improvement in his putting. In late 2023, while ranked as the best player from tee to green, he was among the worst putters on tour. He then began working with renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon, who helped him with green reading, his grip, and most critically, a switch from a blade to a mallet-style putter. This change sparked an incredible run of form, solidifying his position as the world's top player ahead of The Open Championship.</p>

          <h2>China's Q2 Economic Growth Surpasses Expectations, but Deflation and Weak Consumption Persist</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:21:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and keeping it on track to meet its annual 5% target. However, underlying data reveals significant weaknesses, including slowing retail sales growth and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite resilient industrial output, economists point to a sharp decline in a broad measure of prices, fueling deflationary fears and calls for more substantial government stimulus. While officials expect consumer prices to improve, analysts note that the growth was partly driven by price discounting, which erodes trade terms and points to underlying fragility in the economy.

          <h2>Spanish Jesuit Priest Dedicates Life to Preserving St. Ignatius Pilgrimage Route</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:14:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For over a decade, 65-year-old Jesuit priest Josep Lluís Iriberri has almost single-handedly maintained the Camino Ignaciano, a 600-km pilgrimage route in Spain. The path recreates the transformational 1522 journey of St. Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Iriberri designed the route, marks the trail, and personally guides groups, combining hiking with spiritual exercises drawn from Ignatius's teachings. Despite receiving patronage from the Vatican, the pilgrimage's future is uncertain, as it struggles to attract enough walkers to become self-sustaining without Iriberri's dedicated stewardship.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025 and making up 40% of all passenger cars in Oslo. This success is attributed to long-term, consistent government policies that incentivize EV ownership while heavily taxing gasoline and diesel cars. Key measures include VAT exemptions, discounts on road and parking taxes, access to bus lanes, and significant investment in public charging infrastructure. The country's experience demonstrates how sustained policy can rapidly shift consumer behavior and transform a nation's transportation landscape.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is billed as the "world's largest wooden construction project," with an investment of about $1.25 billion. The development, named Sickla, will feature thousands of homes, offices, and schools built primarily from cross-laminated timber, a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. This initiative aims to showcase a new model for urban development, significantly reducing the construction sector's carbon footprint, which currently accounts for 37% of global emissions. The project leverages Sweden's deep cultural and economic connection to its forests and aims to create an attractive, environmentally friendly urban space.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, following a significant reversal in U.S. policy. The U.S. government had previously halted sales of the chips, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls, by requiring a license. However, Nvidia stated that the government has now assured the company that licenses will be granted, a move that follows intense lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang and a recent preliminary trade framework agreement between Washington and Beijing. This development is a major win for Nvidia, allowing it to reclaim its market share in the crucial Chinese AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building massive artificial intelligence data centers across the United States. The company is developing several "multi-gigawatt" clusters to power its efforts in creating "superintelligence," a form of AI that could surpass human intellect. The first of these huge facilities, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. This massive investment underscores the escalating race among tech giants to achieve dominance in AI, despite growing concerns about the immense energy and water consumption of such data centers.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, nicknamed "Big Dumper," won the 2025 MLB All-Star Home Run Derby, defeating Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round. Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, is the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to ever win the competition. He advanced through the first round on a tiebreaker and hit consistently throughout the night, with his father, a former college coach, pitching to him.

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals react to sounds produced by plants. Scientists discovered that female moths chose not to lay their eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "scream" sounds, which the plants emit when they are dehydrated or otherwise distressed. The moths appeared to associate these sounds with an unhealthy host for their larvae. This groundbreaking finding suggests a previously unknown layer of communication in ecosystems, opening a new field of study into how animals and potentially other plants use these sounds to make decisions.</p>
