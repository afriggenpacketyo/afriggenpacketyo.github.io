FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move aims to strengthen the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The new office will also focus on combating transnational crime, including cybercrime, narcotics trafficking, and online child exploitation. This development signifies a deeper law enforcement partnership between the U.S. and New Zealand, enhancing collaboration on shared security challenges.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a comprehensive trade deal, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on South Korean exports to the U.S., including key sectors like automobiles. As part of the agreement, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment in the U.S., though the two nations appear to have different interpretations of how these funds will be controlled and utilized. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive beef and rice markets from further U.S. access, critics note the deal negates benefits from their existing free trade agreement. The deal avoids a threatened 25% tariff, aligning South Korea's rate with Japan's. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that strengthens penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The legislation allows prosecutors to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense, a change from the previous misdemeanor charge. The bill, AB 379, was controversial, with some lawmakers raising concerns that it could be used to unfairly target minorities. The law also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders and non-compliant hoteliers.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that while she seriously considered the gubernatorial race, she believes she can have a greater impact on the national stage, keeping the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>Following an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles officials have restricted the construction of duplexes in the fire-ravaged Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The move exempts the area from SB 9, a state law designed to increase housing density, after residents raised concerns that more building could worsen evacuation routes in future wildfires. While duplexes are being blocked, the addition of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) has been streamlined and widely adopted by homeowners rebuilding in the area. The decision has drawn criticism from pro-development groups, who argue it undermines state housing goals.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would be cheaper and less disruptive by avoiding the need to reroute the M25 motorway. This marks the first time a rival bid for the long-debated expansion has been formally considered by the government. The proposal aims to deliver a fully operational runway by 2035 at a lower cost than Heathrow's current estimate.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused concern when he left the mound with a trainer during the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. The team later announced the early exit was due to cramping, a relatively minor issue that alleviated initial fears of a more serious injury. Ohtani was able to remain in the game as a designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-2. The incident occurred on a hot and humid night, and manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the injury was not severe, expecting Ohtani to make his next start.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though in an unusual move, two board members dissented, favoring a rate reduction. The decision comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain economic effects of the administration's tariffs and recent data showing moderated growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cautious approach is warranted, as the full impact of tariffs on inflation and growth is not yet clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Russia, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are generated and what risks they pose. A tsunami requires a strong undersea earthquake, typically magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, creating powerful waves that can travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean. As these waves approach shallow coastal areas, they slow down and increase dramatically in height, becoming incredibly destructive. The article provides safety advice, emphasizing that people should immediately move to higher ground upon receiving a warning, as the waves are too fast to outrun.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has captured unprecedented images of abundant life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team discovered what they describe as thriving communities of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, in a pitch-black environment under immense pressure. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings challenge previous assumptions about life's limits and suggest such "chemosynthetic" ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

These academics argue that the term "screen time" is too broad and fails to distinguish between different types of online activity. While the debate continues, there is no scientific consensus, leaving parents with inconsistent guidance on managing their children's technology use.</p>
