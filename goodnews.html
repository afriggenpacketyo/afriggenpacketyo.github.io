          <h2>Chinese Military Scientists Propose More Powerful 'X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists with the Chinese army have proposed a new 'X-railgun' design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, first mounted on a ship in 2018, is limited by the weight of projectiles it can fire, making it less effective against large targets. The proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which would significantly increase bore pressure. According to the project team, this would allow the weapon to fire a 30kg projectile at Mach 7, overcoming a key technological hurdle and enhancing its military application.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still viewed overwhelmingly as a worthwhile achievement that contributed to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting a widespread public appetite for future missions.</p>

          <h2>China's Open-Source AI Models Challenge Dominance of US Tech Giants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese tech firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are leveraging open-source AI to redefine the global technology landscape and challenge the closed systems of American giants like OpenAI and Google. By making their large language models' source code and weights freely available, they foster collaborative development and have gained support from developers worldwide. This open-source movement has unleashed a wave of new AI applications within China and presents a viable alternative to the more restrictive, proprietary models from Silicon Valley. Analysts suggest this trend poses a serious competitive challenge to U.S. leadership in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement came during a dinner with Republican senators, where Trump praised the work of his Middle East envoy. Meanwhile, reports indicate Israeli intelligence officials have been discussing the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza with international partners.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to support its defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. The tanks are a key component of a $160 million package, with most of the 49 promised vehicles now in Ukrainian possession. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over $980 million in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment. This move underscores Australia's continued commitment to supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for the conflict, which it has labeled an illegal and immoral invasion.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a U.S. Marine veteran, has brought to life a vision that helped him endure the horrors of the Vietnam War. During intense fighting, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow to cope with the trauma. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now, the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, has delighted over a million visitors and has become a source of profound healing and joy for Harrison and his community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States. The law specifically targets stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own. Supporters, including key figures from the crypto industry present at the signing, believe this will foster innovation, strengthen the dollar's role in digital finance, and provide much-needed consumer protections. The administration views this as a significant step toward integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its regulations for a future dominated by tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges, particularly for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. As private digital currencies gain traction, spurred by the Trump administration's recent embrace of the technology, international regulators are intensifying their scrutiny. The BIS emphasizes the need for a new framework to manage these emerging financial instruments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to his White House physician, the condition is benign, common in people over 70, and was confirmed via ultrasound and blood tests, which ruled out more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, have difficulty returning blood to the heart, causing it to pool. Treatment for mild cases typically involves lifestyle changes such as wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and regular exercise to improve circulation.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal practices to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical support for U.S. Department of Defense cloud services. The change follows a report detailing how the Pentagon's cloud infrastructure was being supported by these overseas engineers, raising national security and cybersecurity concerns. The previous arrangement involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the work of more technically proficient engineers in China. Microsoft stated the move is a response to these concerns and reflects its commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After several quieter years, the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant resurgence in wasp populations this summer. Pest control professionals and insect experts attribute the increase to the very warm and dry spring weather, which created ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike social wasps, experts emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in gardens and agricultural landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>
