          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing that led to the creation of the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" sticker on music albums. The effort was spearheaded by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore, who argued for "truth in packaging" to help parents guide their children's listening habits. Musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Frank Zappa, and John Denver testified against the labels, framing the issue as one of censorship, but the PMRC ultimately succeeded in getting the recording industry to adopt the voluntary warning stickers.</p>

They stated that the current market is still in the "bottom of the first inning," reflecting their strong belief in the long-term value and early stage of the cryptocurrency's adoption.

          <p>A South African court has denied an attempt by Thabo Bester, a convicted murderer and sexual assaulter known as the "Facebook Rapist," to block the release of a Netflix documentary about his case. Bester, who escaped from prison by faking his own death in a fire, argued the film would violate his right to a fair trial. The judge dismissed the urgent application, stating the case is already in the public domain, though Bester can still sue for defamation after the documentary airs. He was recaptured in Tanzania in 2023.</p>

          <p>After a dominant first half, the Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has struggled significantly since early July, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. While injuries to key players have been a factor, the team also acknowledges a decline in fundamental execution, such as having competitive "team at-bats" and capitalizing on scoring opportunities. With the postseason approaching, the Dodgers are placing a renewed emphasis on their strategic approach at the plate, hoping that better health and a focus on fundamentals will rectify their performance and prevent a repeat of past playoff disappointments.</p>

          <p>The European Union has accepted Microsoft's commitment to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office software suites, allowing the company to avoid a significant antitrust fine. The decision follows a 2023 investigation, prompted by a complaint from rival Slack, which alleged that Microsoft's bundling practices were anti-competitive. Under the binding agreement, Microsoft will offer versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price and improve interoperability with competing products, a move praised by the European Commission as a step to restore fair competition.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing generative AI to create real-time language translation devices, bringing a long-standing science fiction concept closer to reality. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods, allowing for seamless conversation between speakers of different languages. This move places Apple in direct competition with Google's Pixel phones, which can translate calls while preserving the speaker's voice inflections, and Meta's smart glasses, which also feature translation capabilities, marking a new battleground for AI innovation.</p>

          <p>Exactly 48 years after his death in police custody, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority has announced it will reopen the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko, who founded the Black Consciousness Movement, died from a brain hemorrhage, which his family has long maintained was the result of torture by police, contrary to the official claim of a hunger strike. Despite evidence presented to the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, no one has ever been held accountable, and this new inquest aims to formally rule on whether a crime was committed.</p>

          <p>For retirees on fixed incomes facing rising costs, tapping into home equity can provide crucial financial relief without the burden of additional monthly loan payments. One primary option is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their equity, with the loan being repaid only when the home is sold. Other alternatives include home equity sharing agreements, where a company provides cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, and sale-leaseback arrangements, which unlock the full equity value.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are preparing to launch competing daily pills for weight loss in the U.S. next year, shifting their rivalry from injectables to the oral drug market. While Lilly's injectable Zepbound currently offers the highest efficacy, questions remain about how widely the less-effective oral medications will be adopted. Lilly is confident its pill, orforglipron, will fare well against Novo's oral semaglutide in a head-to-head trial, citing manufacturing advantages and fewer dietary restrictions, even as initial data suggests Novo's pill may produce more weight loss.</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's target, many Americans with high-interest credit card debt are facing continued financial pressure. Waiting for significant interest rate cuts to provide relief is likely an ineffective strategy, as any reductions are expected to be small and their future is uncertain due to persistent inflation. Borrowers should instead proactively explore debt relief options now, such as credit counseling, debt management programs, or debt settlement, which can significantly reduce balances without relying on unpredictable changes in the broader economic climate.
