          <h2>Electric Grills Gain Popularity as a Climate-Friendly Alternative</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 05:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the growing trend of using electric grills as a more climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills. Many people are switching to electric grills due to their convenience and the increasing cost of propane, while also reducing their carbon footprint. Electric grills are becoming more advanced, with some models reaching high temperatures and offering precise temperature control, appealing to younger consumers and those in apartments where gas grills may be restricted. Some chefs note electric grills are convenient for cooking items that cook quickly, though purists may miss the flavors imparted by wood or charcoal. </p>

          <p>This article reports on Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's return to the Cannes Film Festival after more than two decades, despite facing a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel in Iran. Panahi's new film, "It Was Just an Accident," confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer. The film was shot in secret and features unveiled female characters, defying Iran's hijab law, and is a sharp break from Panahi's previous works. Panahi insists he's simply doing the only thing he knows how, and that no regime can stop him from making films. </p>

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that the intense criticism aimed at Harvard has become excessive, calling it "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges the university's serious ailments but cautions against punitive measures that could harm its intricate system developed over centuries. Pinker addresses concerns about academic freedom, viewpoint diversity, and antisemitism at Harvard, advocating for a balanced approach to address these issues rather than an all-out assault. </p>

          <p>The energy price cap will fall in July, leading to a typical household saving of ¬£11 a month, and the regulator Ofgem advises consumers to shop around for cheaper fixed deals. Switching to a fixed deal could potentially save customers up to ¬£200 annually, although those currently on fixed deals won't benefit from the immediate price drop. Prices remain high, and many households are still struggling with energy costs, with significant customer debt to suppliers. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will roll out its new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards that emphasize readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT consists of five events, including a three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, with combat roles held to the highest standards, and the test is designed to improve soldier readiness and ensure physical standards. </p>
