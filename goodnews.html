          <p>As the United States potentially wavers in its support, Europe is increasingly optimistic about its capacity to defend Ukraine. While Europe possesses the financial resources and artillery shells necessary, replacing key U.S. capabilities, such as operational intelligence and air defense, would prove challenging. This shift in sentiment reflects Europe's growing commitment to ensuring Ukraine's security in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as the continued and urgent need for Ukraine to not be left to collapse against Russia. The situation highlights the evolving dynamics of international alliances and defense strategies.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind since the war, was temporarily delayed due to a resident's refusal to evacuate. The evacuated area included the old part of the city, numerous hotels, bridges, the town hall, and train stations, but excluded the Cologne Cathedral. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city's history as a major bombing target during World War II, highlighting the enduring legacy of the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Strong Government Remains Beneficial Despite Trump's Leadership, Argues Vox Correspondent</h2>

          <p>A Vox correspondent argues that a strong federal government is still beneficial, even with Donald Trump in power, because the primary issue with Trump's presidency is a lack of oversight, not excessive government power. While acknowledging concerns about potential abuses of power, the author contends that reducing government size could consolidate Trump's power. The author points to the COVID-19 pandemic response as an example of the necessity of a robust state and advocates for strengthening checks and balances rather than shrinking government. The author suggests that a larger government with proper oversight is preferable, as it can address basic needs and provide essential services.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate recently reached a record high, nearing a widely recommended rule of thumb. In the first quarter of 2025, the 401(k) savings rate, including employer and employee contributions, rose to 14.3%, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred an average of 9.5% into their 401(k) plans, while companies contributed 4.8%.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant deported to El Salvador. The decision follows a request from a media coalition, including CBS News, asserting the public's right to access court records. The Justice Department opposed the release, citing the documents as discovery materials and concerns for national security. The Trump administration has acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status preventing his removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution by local gangs.</p>

          <p>Archivists are facing challenges in preserving historical records due to the shift towards digital communication and storage. The rise of text messages, disappearing voice notes, and encrypted platforms makes it difficult to capture intimate details and important information for future historians.

Archivists are exploring new methods of managing and presenting digital collections, such as metadata-based access, but these approaches may sacrifice serendipitous discoveries and raise ethical questions.</p>
