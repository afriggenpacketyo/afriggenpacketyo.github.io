          <h2>Argentina Adjusts Sorghum Export Standards to Strengthen Trade with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 11:11:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's government has tightened its export standards for sorghum, a move designed to boost its agricultural trade with China and solidify its position as a reliable supplier. The new regulations establish stricter grading rules based on weight, impurities, and broken kernels to meet the demands of foreign markets. This policy shift aligns Argentine standards with those of key trading partners, particularly China, which has become the primary buyer of its sorghum since 2021. The change could create new trade tensions with the United States, which was previously the main sorghum supplier to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a continued push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, workers are engaging in forms of passive resistance to maintain flexibility. According to Stanford research, work-from-home rates have remained steady since spring 2023, with a growing gap between official policies and employee compliance. Many middle managers are not strictly enforcing mandates, while workers practice behaviors like "coffee badging"—showing up for just a few hours—or "micro-shifting" their work schedules. This trend highlights a persistent desire for flexibility, even as employers try to reassert in-office norms.</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced a new "Rings" award to recognize 25 top creators, providing them with a physical gold ring and a special profile badge but no monetary prize. This initiative comes after Meta, Instagram's parent company, ended its Reels Play bonus program, a significant source of income for many creators. The move has raised questions about the platform's support for its creator community, especially as brand deals slow industry-wide. A panel including filmmaker Spike Lee and YouTuber Marques Brownlee will select the winners based on effort and risk-taking rather than follower count.</p>

          <p>Home lending experts predict that mortgage interest rates will likely remain stable through October, even with an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and mixed economic signals. After dipping in September in anticipation of a Fed rate cut, rates have slightly increased, and analysts believe another potential cut may already be factored into the market. Economic data on inflation and employment are creating a "cloudy" outlook, causing market reactivity. Prospective homebuyers are advised to consider their personal financial goals and circumstances when deciding whether to lock in a rate. (not investment advice)</p>
