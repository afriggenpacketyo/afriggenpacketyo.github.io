          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities may receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 per year. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education, while supporters claim it will provide families with greater educational freedom.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to discard thousands of ballots. The ruling is a victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes after two recounts. Judge Richard E. Myers II, a Trump appointee, stated that invalidating military and overseas ballots would violate voters' due process rights. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation, and experts warn it could set a precedent for future attempts to overturn elections.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett will retire at the end of the year as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era. Buffett's performance at Berkshire Hathaway was a thousand times that of the blue-chip American index. Buffett stood out on Wall Street because he eschewed its frequent chicanery, self-dealing and greed and revered the institutions of capitalism; most especially, he treated the executive‚Äôs duty to shareholders as a sacred trust. One of his favorite aphorisms was that investors would invest more wisely if they were told at birth they could make only 20 investment decisions.</p>

The site, created in 2018, was described as "the most prominent and mainstream marketplace" for deepfake porn. The shutdown comes after Congress passed the "Take It Down Act," making it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. Experts believe the shutdown is a step in the right direction but the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will not go away entirely.</p>
