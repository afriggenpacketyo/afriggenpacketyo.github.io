        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports from sources close to Pamela Anderson and Liam Neeson claim their widely publicized romance is genuine, pushing back against allegations that it was a publicity stunt for their movie, "The Naked Gun." Insiders told People magazine that the connection between the two actors is real and that neither would participate in a fabricated relationship for promotional purposes. These statements contradict claims from other outlets like TMZ, which suggested the romance was orchestrated by their PR teams. While the co-stars have displayed affection during their press tour, they have not officially confirmed their relationship status, leaving their on-screen and off-screen chemistry a subject of public speculation.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national women's rugby team has advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time in over two decades after defeating Fiji in a hard-fought match. Winger Francesca McGhie was a standout player, scoring two tries to bring her tournament total to five. Despite a strong effort from Fiji, who scored three tries of their own, Scotland's cohesive performance and a remarkable individual try from Emma Orr secured the victory. The win sets up a decisive Pool B match against Canada next weekend, as the Scottish team continues its historic tournament run. The victory marks a significant milestone for Scottish women's rugby on the international stage.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a controversial home run celebration has been sold for nearly $10,000 at an auction. The incident, where Rocco flipped his bat after a home run, led to his ejection and a suspension that was later overturned by a judge following a legal challenge by his father. All proceeds from the auction, managed by Goldin Auctions, will be donated to his Haddonfield Little League program. The bat flip gained national attention, with many major league players expressing their support for the young player, turning a moment of controversy into a positive financial contribution for his local league.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo collaborated for a unique performance titled "Sarabande Africaine" at the Hollywood Bowl, exploring the African origins of the classical sarabande dance form. The concert featured a fusion of works from Bach, Handel, Philip Glass, and Gershwin, all reinterpreted with African rhythms and instrumentation. Kidjo's powerful stage presence complemented Ma's more subtle, integrative cello performance, creating a dialogue between diverse musical traditions. A highlight was their rendition of Philip Glass's "Move On," a piece originally based on a David Bowie song, which showcased the deep artistic connection between the two performers and their shared message of global unity.</p>

Red Bull's Max Verstappen, a home favorite, qualified in third place, acknowledging his team's difficulties throughout the weekend. A standout performance came from rookie Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls, who qualified an impressive fourth, ahead of drivers from both Mercedes and Ferrari. The close qualifying times set the stage for a highly competitive race on Sunday.</p>

          <p>China's senior trade negotiator, Li, concluded a three-day visit to the United States where he called for an "equal dialogue" to resolve ongoing economic and trade issues. During his trip, he met with officials from the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments, as well as representatives from major American business councils and companies. The discussions focused on bilateral trade relations and the implementation of previous agreements between the two nations. This visit serves as a preparatory step for the fourth round of trade talks, which are anticipated to take place before a 90-day truce on tariffs expires and a potential visit by President Trump to China.</p>

          <p>Declining water levels in Iraq's Mosul Dam reservoir, a consequence of severe and prolonged drought, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. Archaeologists were able to access the site in the Duhok province only after the water receded to historic lows this year. The tombs are thought to date back to the Hellenistic period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for archaeological excavation. The discovery highlights the rich history of the region, as researchers work to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is once again submerged.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's absence from public events for four days has fueled widespread speculation and rumors on social media, with hashtags like #whereistrump trending. Despite the online frenzy, which included false claims of his death, Trump was active on his Truth Social platform, posting about his tariff policies. Some commentators noted that the writing style of his recent posts seemed different from his usual tone, adding to the speculation. The rumors may have been amplified by recent questions about his health and comments from Vice President JD Vance about being prepared to assume the presidency. However, reporters later confirmed that Trump was seen heading to play golf on Saturday morning.</p>

This commentary article explores how different groups are projecting their own narratives onto the event.

The author also critiques the celebration of Kelce as a feminist ally, pointing to his past comments and defense of a teammate who made misogynistic remarks, highlighting the complex and often contradictory ways celebrity relationships are consumed by the public.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University topping the list. The analysis considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and median post-graduation earnings. While private colleges often have high sticker prices, elite institutions with large endowments, such as Princeton, MIT, and Harvard, provide generous financial aid packages that significantly lower the net cost for many students. Graduates from these top-ranked private schools often go on to earn higher median incomes than their counterparts from even the best-value public universities. (not investment advice)</p>

While external factors like AI, politics, and economics are transforming higher education, the core elements of the experience—forming friendships, learning independence, and navigating personal growth—remain constant. The article compiles several past essays that delve into these themes, from lessons learned at a 30th college reunion to the way the parent-child relationship evolves when a student leaves home.
