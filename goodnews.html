          <p>Monterrey, Mexico, serves as a vibrant cultural center for cumbia music, a genre that originated in Colombia but found new life and unique expressions through Mexican "sonideros"—DJs dedicated to collecting and playing tropical records. This article delves into the genre's deep cultural roots within migrant neighborhoods, where accidental innovations like the slowed-down "cumbia rebajada" and the distinctive "cholombiano" subculture developed. Despite a period of intense organized crime that forced celebrations indoors, cumbia has resiliently returned to the streets, with dance groups actively reclaiming and celebrating this integral part of their identity, demonstrating the enduring power of music to foster community.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asserts that the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," marked by inflated company valuations and a tendency to fund both promising and weak ideas indiscriminately. Despite this speculative environment, Bezos maintains that AI technology is fundamentally "real" and will ultimately provide "gigantic" benefits across every industry, drawing a historical parallel to the 1990s biotech bubble that, despite its burst, led to significant advancements. Other financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, share similar concerns about market exuberance and anticipate a potential "drawdown" in equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Sarah Mullally has been named the new Archbishop of Canterbury, marking a historic moment as the first woman to lead the Church of England in nearly 500 years. The former NHS chief nurse and first female Bishop of London, Mullally immediately condemned the "horrific violence" of the Manchester synagogue attack, stressing the importance of standing against hatred. Her appointment follows Justin Welby's resignation amid a safeguarding scandal, and she inherits significant challenges, including addressing past abuse, reversing declining church attendance, and navigating divisive issues like assisted dying and same-sex marriage blessings. Mullally hopes her role will inspire confidence and possibilities for young women.</p>

          <p>Latter-day Saints churchgoers have initiated a fundraiser for the family of Thomas Jacob Sanford, the alleged mass shooter who killed four and injured eight at a Michigan church. Despite reports of Sanford's anti-Mormon motivations, organizer David Butler justified the effort by citing biblical teachings on supporting the fatherless and widows, noting that one of Sanford's sons requires ongoing medical care. The GiveSendGo campaign has garnered substantial donations, with many contributors expressing forgiveness and solidarity for the grieving family. This unique act of compassion contrasts with other fundraisers solely dedicated to supporting the victims of the tragic attack.</p>

          <p>A significant breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Texas yoghurt shop murders, with advanced DNA and ballistics technology identifying Robert Eugene Brashers as the likely serial killer responsible for the brutal deaths of four teenage girls. This cold case, which endured for 34 years and resulted in wrongful convictions, now links Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, to the crime scene evidence and several other unsolved murders across multiple states. The development offers long-awaited closure for the victims' families and fully exonerates two men previously imprisoned for the crimes, while also underscoring the transformative potential of forensic advancements in resolving other cold cases.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing significant lobbying pressure from industry and some celebrity chefs as he deliberates on signing a bill that would ban cookware containing PFAS "forever chemicals." Public health advocates strongly support the legislation, emphasizing the chemicals' links to various serious health issues and the existence of viable, safer alternatives. Conversely, industry groups argue the ban would negatively impact restaurants and consumers, despite evidence from other states suggesting such bans have not caused widespread shortages. Newsom's decision, coming amidst speculation about his presidential aspirations, is viewed as a crucial moment for environmental policy in the face of powerful corporate interests.</p>

          <p>Brendan Wallace, CEO of Fifth Wall, has announced that the "winter" for property technology (proptech) has concluded, pointing to successful recent IPOs like ServiceTitan and the rise of new unicorns such as Juniper Square and Bilt. He acknowledges a challenging period characterized by high interest rates and capital market contraction, but highlights an "unprecedented" creation of enterprise value in the past 15 months. Conversely, climate-related proptech investments are still struggling due to a significant political shift away from sustainability in the U.S. Despite this, Wallace maintains long-term optimism, driven by local government initiatives and currently attractive valuations.

          <p>Vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are exempt from the Trump administration's recent tariff rollback, protected by the Cold War-era Berman Amendment which safeguards "informational materials." This exemption is vital for the booming vinyl market, which has experienced a significant resurgence, especially among Gen Z, now comprising nearly three-quarters of U.S. physical music revenue. While some American record manufacturers express concern about this exemption hindering domestic production, it prevents price increases for consumers and substantially benefits major record labels, particularly with artists like Taylor Swift driving immense sales through collectible variants and new releases.</p>

His strategy involves consistently investing 15% of her total income (combining her main job's $52,400 and a second job's $14,000) and fully leveraging her employer's 401(k) match, even if she receives no future raises. Ramsey emphasized a "process driven, math driven" approach, recommending maximizing catch-up contributions, investing in diversified stock index funds for growth, and potentially delaying retirement.
