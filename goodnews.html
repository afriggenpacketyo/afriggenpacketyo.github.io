          <h2>Sean Duffy Appointed as Interim NASA Administrator by President Trump</h2>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the interim head of NASA. This appointment follows the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur backed by Elon Musk, as the nominee for the permanent role. Trump cited Isaacman's Democratic political donations and close professional ties to Musk, whose company SpaceX holds significant NASA contracts, as reasons for the change. Duffy's temporary leadership comes at a critical time as the agency pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and a future mission to Mars.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. This move comes as the central bank evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures designed to cool down Seoul's rapidly heating housing market, which saw prices surge over 19% in June. Authorities are concerned about the significant rise in household debt linked to real estate. The decision to hold rates follows a cut in May, which occurred during a period of political uncertainty and US tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his administration will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression. The decision reverses a recent, temporary halt in some arms shipments, a pause which the president claimed he was not aware of who ordered it. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending the weapons at Trump's direction to secure a lasting peace. The move comes after Trump expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian populations.</p>

          <p>A tentative contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services. The strike by 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees, led to piles of uncollected trash across the city during a summer heatwave. The new three-year contract reportedly includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Workers, including sanitation crews, immediately returned to their jobs as the city began cleanup efforts, with a union ratification vote pending.</p>
