          <p>A research team in China is endeavoring to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. According to ancient historical texts, the ornate bronze device could detect distant earthquakes and even indicate the direction of their epicenter. Although some modern scholars have dismissed the invention as a myth, this project aims to restore its place in history by recreating it with the aid of modern science and newly discovered clues.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI has fortunately revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The injury primarily affects his throwing, not his hitting, and he is expected to be sidelined for 10 to 14 days. This news comes as a relief to the team and its fans, who feared a more severe, long-term injury for the star player, who hopes to return quickly as a designated hitter.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his passing, rock legend Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered not just for his heavy metal career but also for his iconic role as an early 2000s reality television star.

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists are explaining the intense physical and emotional reactions that accompany high-stakes sporting events. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, leads to increased heart rate and jitters, which are signs of deep emotional investment. Experts recommend managing this anxiety by resting, planning the day, eating well, and using physical movement to release energy, thereby reframing the nerves as part of a positive, shared experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently in the midst of its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures dipping below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the persistent chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While residents and tourists are bundling up, experts caution that the region's hottest weather often arrives in September and October, so the cold spell may not last.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly those from residents of new, nearby housing developments. Under the proposed changes, the responsibility for soundproofing would fall on developers, and the process for opening new establishments or expanding outdoor areas would be fast-tracked. These reforms are designed to help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry by cutting restrictive red tape.</p>
