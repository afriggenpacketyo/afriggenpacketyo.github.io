          <p>A University of Cambridge professor, Nita Forouhi, debunks common myths about cooking oils, advising on healthier choices for home cooking. The article clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils are good for us, being low in saturated fats and high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats, contrary to some negative claims. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy due to near-zero trans fats. While extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying.</p>
