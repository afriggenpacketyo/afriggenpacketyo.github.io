          <p>Michael Conforto's late RBI single propelled the Dodgers to a 6-5 victory over the Mets, salvaging a series split. Despite struggling earlier in the game, Conforto delivered the crucial hit in the eighth inning, driving in the go-ahead run. The Dodgers' comeback was necessary after a less effective outing from pitcher Landon Knack, who allowed four runs in just over three innings. This win puts the Dodgers ahead of the Padres in the NL West standings, highlighting the significance of Conforto's clutch performance.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that anti-discrimination laws protect all employees equally, regardless of their status as a majority or minority group member. The justices rejected the notion that majority group members need to provide more evidence of discrimination to win a case. The ruling revives a lawsuit by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. This decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual based on various factors.</p>
