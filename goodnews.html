          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. has agreed to arrangements allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff. Separately, Japan and the EU reaffirmed their collaboration in maintaining global free trade amidst Trump's tariff policies. Trump also stated that upcoming trade talks with China in Switzerland would be substantive.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight the US-UK trade deal, with emphasis on the role of Brexit in facilitating the agreement and its potential to save the British car industry. The deal includes concessions for car and steel exports but retains a levy on most goods. There are also reports that the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim disputed by the government. The papers also note the selection of Cardinal Prevost as the first American Pope, with his message of building bridges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a major shift from its protectionist policies. This potential deal, driven by President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports, aims to boost bilateral trade, which reached $129 billion in 2024. While some experts believe the deal won't significantly harm domestic industries, others caution about the impact on India's manufacturing ambitions. A trade deal could benefit logistics companies and consumer staples, with potential downsides for financials, materials, and healthcare sectors if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported mixed first-quarter results, with inclement weather impacting comparable store sales, but strong performance in April offers hope for the second quarter. The company's revenue exceeded expectations, but earnings per share fell short. Despite the earnings miss, the stock rose due to positive trends in March, April, and May, indicating the brand's resilience. However, an increased commodity cost inflation outlook is expected to squeeze margins. Overall, Texas Roadhouse's value and customer experience position it well to manage economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The enforcement of skort wearing in camogie has ignited a debate about sexism, with former All-Star Jane Adams urging the Camogie Association to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has scheduled a Special Congress to vote on the issue. While some argue that the skort is unfit for purpose, others believe there are more pressing issues facing women's sports.</p>
