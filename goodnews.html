          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a jailed Belarusian opposition leader, has been released from prison after being incarcerated since 2020. His release coincided with a visit from US Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to help facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed her gratitude to the US for their efforts in securing his release. Tsikhanouski was originally jailed after attempting to challenge Lukashenko in an election. </p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is forecast to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record high temperatures.

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, specifically the FDA's slow approval process for new UV filters, contribute to this disparity. While US sunscreens generally protect against UVB rays, they often provide weaker UVA protection compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives. </p>
