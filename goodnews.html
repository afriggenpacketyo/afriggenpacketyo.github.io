          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open at Royal Portrush, finishing four strokes ahead of his nearest competitor. The 29-year-old world number one demonstrated commanding control throughout the final round, securing his second major championship of 2025. This victory marks his fourth career major, placing him in an elite group alongside Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as players who have won The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. He now only needs a U.S. Open title to complete the coveted career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>A dietary strategy known as "meal sequencing" could offer health benefits, according to nutrition experts. The practice involves consuming fiber-rich vegetables, protein, and fats before eating carbohydrates, which may help prevent significant spikes in blood sugar after meals. This approach is considered particularly beneficial for individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, as it can slow glucose absorption. Additionally, eating protein and fiber first can increase feelings of fullness, potentially aiding in weight management by suppressing appetite and delaying gastric emptying.</p>

          <p>After his decisive win at the Open Championship, Scottie Scheffler stated he is "living out his dreams" but also reiterated his belief that there is "more to life than playing golf." Earlier in the week, the world number one had questioned the ultimate fulfillment found in the sport, a sentiment he stood by after his victory. Scheffler clarified that while he is immensely grateful for his success, winning tournaments does not fulfill the "deepest desires of your heart." He acknowledged the joy of the win but maintained his perspective that personal happiness is not solely defined by professional achievements.</p>

          <p>As Germany experiences increasingly frequent and intense heat waves, authorities are focusing on public protection measures, particularly for vulnerable populations. With temperatures recently soaring near 40°C (104°F), the government has launched informational websites and uses a national warning app to advise residents on safety. Doctors are urging the public not to underestimate the health risks, such as heart and circulatory failure, which led to approximately 6,000 heat-related deaths in Germany over the last two years. Experts are calling for more effective climate protection and better infrastructure, as many buildings still lack air conditioning.</p>
