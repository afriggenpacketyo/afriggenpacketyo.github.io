          <p>Lowe's surpassed Wall Street's earnings forecasts in its latest fiscal quarter, driven by increased demand for home projects, though larger-scale renovations remained subdued. The home improvement retailer announced an $8.8 billion acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor for large residential and commercial professionals, signaling a strategic shift towards this more stable customer segment. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted a 'healthy pipeline of demand' from an aging housing stock and pent-up renovation needs, expressing confidence that these investments will accelerate sales growth as the market improves. Despite a slight revision to full-year earnings guidance, Lowe's shares rose, contrasting with competitor Home Depot's recent performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>TJX Companies, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, leading to an increase in its full-year fiscal 2026 guidance. The discounter demonstrated robust customer demand across its U.S. and international divisions, with comparable sales growing 4%, surpassing analyst estimates. CEO Ernie Herrman expressed confidence in the company's ability to offset higher costs from tariffs, which were factored into the updated outlook. Analysts suggest that off-price retailers like TJX are well-positioned to gain market share from traditional department stores due to their purchasing model, which often sidesteps direct tariff impacts.

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart surged over 12% on Wednesday, following the announcement of a remarkable near-400% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. This significant financial growth is largely attributed to the booming global demand for its 'ugly-cute' Labubu dolls, which have gained international celebrity endorsement. The company's revenue jumped by 204.4%, exceeding earlier forecasts, and CEO Wang Ning expressed confidence in hitting ambitious revenue targets for the year. Despite concerns from some analysts about the long-term popularity of its IPs and recent Chinese state media calls for stricter oversight of 'blind-box' toys, Pop Mart continues its global expansion strategy.

          <p>England's head coach John Mitchell has selected an unchanged starting XV for the Red Roses' opening game of the Women's Rugby World Cup against the United States in Sunderland. This powerful lineup mirrors the side that secured a decisive victory over France in their final warm-up match. Captain Zoe Aldcroft will lead the team from blind-side flanker, with 2014 World Cup-winner Alex Matthews at number eight. The squad also includes veteran Emily Scarratt among the replacements, who is poised to become the first English rugby union player to participate in five World Cups. The team is poised for a strong start in the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Current Mortgage and Refinance Interest Rates for August 20, 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 08:52:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of August 20, 2025, average mortgage rates stand at 6.64% for a 30-year fixed loan and 5.82% for a 15-year fixed loan, according to Bankrate, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Despite elevated rates compared to previous years, new homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still secure favorable terms, especially with strong credit profiles. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Fed rate hikes could stabilize mortgage rates. To secure the best rates, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit, shop around for different lenders, and carefully compare loan terms and fees before locking in a rate.

          <p>India is actively strengthening its diplomatic and economic ties with China and Russia, a move that comes amidst growing friction with the U.S. over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed 'steady progress' in relations with China after meeting Foreign Minister Wang Yi, agreeing to resume direct flights and boost trade. Concurrently, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Moscow, where Russian officials confirmed continued oil supplies and a planned meeting between Putin and Modi. Experts view India's strategy as an effort to balance diverse partnerships and maintain strategic autonomy, rather than solely a response to U.S. actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 08:46:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can find affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average interest rates currently around 8.12% for HELOCs and slightly higher for fixed-rate home equity loans. These rates are significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards, making them attractive for large sums. Home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Both products offer potential tax benefits if used for IRS-eligible home improvements. Homeowners should compare lenders and understand the risks, as their home serves as collateral.

          <p>An unidentified flying object crashed into a cornfield and exploded in eastern Poland early Wednesday, near the village of Osiny, causing broken windows in nearby houses but no injuries. Local police discovered burned metal and plastic debris at the scene, with initial speculation pointing to a part of an old engine. Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command confirmed no airspace violations from Ukraine or Belarus were recorded. Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later stated the object was most likely a drone, and an investigation is underway by civilian and military authorities to determine its origin and nature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of August 20, 2025, Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates offer competitive returns, with top rates significantly exceeding the national average and current inflation rates. For instance, some 6-month CDs yield 4.45% APY, while 5-year CDs offer around 4.20% APY. These accounts provide a safe investment vehicle, typically insured by FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000, allowing savers to lock in high rates for a specified term. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies like CD laddering can help investors leverage short-term high yields while planning for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' has significantly expanded the eligible uses for 529 college savings plans, offering families more flexibility for education-related expenses. Beyond traditional tuition, funds can now be used for qualifying credentialing, vocational programs, professional licensing, and continuing education courses. The law also broadens K-12 education expenses to include tutoring, standardized test prep, and educational therapy, aiming to better prepare students for post-secondary journeys and potentially reduce costs. Additionally, the act introduces 'Trump accounts' for newborns, providing an initial $1,000 federal contribution towards future investment, though 529 plans often offer greater immediate flexibility.
