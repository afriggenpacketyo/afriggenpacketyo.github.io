          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the recall of tomatoes from Ray & Mascari Inc. in 11 states and Williams Farms Repack LLC in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia due to potential salmonella contamination. Ray & Mascari Inc. recalled their Vine Ripe tomatoes sold by Gordon Food Service Stores after being notified by Hanshaw & Caping Farms about possible salmonella presence in their facility. The FDA advises consumers to discard or return the tomatoes, though no illnesses have been reported. Symptoms of salmonella infection include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, posing a greater risk to young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>A recent 60 Minutes report highlighted the growing popularity of egg freezing among young women, detailing the medical procedure where eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored for future use. The article discusses the high costs associated with egg freezing, averaging around $12,000 to $13,000 per cycle, with additional expenses for storage and later IVF procedures. While some companies are beginning to offer egg freezing as a benefit, the majority of women still pay out of pocket. Doctors emphasize that egg freezing does not guarantee pregnancy, and women should be aware of the drop-off rates at each stage, from thawing to implantation.</p>

Women interviewed on 60 Minutes express that egg freezing alleviates the pressure to find a partner quickly and reduces anxiety about their biological clocks. The article also highlights the importance of education about egg freezing and fertility, suggesting that gynecologists should discuss these options with women at a younger age. Dr. Tomer Singer predicts that egg freezing and IVF will become increasingly common, potentially replacing traditional methods of reproduction in the future.</p>
