          <p>A recent incident where a flight attendant asked a passenger to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted the inconsistent and often unclear airline policies regarding smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these items in both carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines have varying rules on their in-flight use. Many major airlines like American, United, and JetBlue do not have specific public policies, leading to confusion and debate among travelers. Delta's policy, however, explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping.</p>

          <p>Social media influencer turned boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight against a largely passive Chavez, who rarely threw punches, much to the dismay of his legendary father at ringside. Despite being booed by the crowd, Paul claimed it was an easy and flawless performance. The victory continues to fuel debate about the legitimacy of Paul's boxing career and the quality of his opponents, as he now calls out current world champions.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new smoking ban that extends to beaches, parks, and other public areas, including near schools and swimming pools. The rules, which went into effect Sunday, are designed to protect the public, especially children, from the dangers of passive smoking and are part of a national goal to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, though there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance a massive spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by President Trump, after a dramatic late-night session. The procedural vote succeeded only after leaders negotiated with a small group of conservative holdouts who were concerned about deficit spending and Medicaid provisions. Senator Ron Johnson ultimately flipped his vote to a 'yes,' securing the needed majority to begin debate. The bill's passage remains uncertain, as it now faces a lengthy process and potential amendments before a final vote.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. This year's events blend joyful celebration with a more defiant, protest-oriented tone in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the community's resistance against these challenges. The marches also contend with reduced corporate sponsorship, as some companies have pulled back from diversity and inclusion initiatives amid shifting public sentiment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to voluntarily partner in tackling obesity. Under the initiative, retailers will be encouraged to make healthy food more accessible and appealing, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulations. Major food retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability, with targets agreed upon with the industry. This policy is part of a broader strategy to improve public health and relieve long-term pressure on the National Health Service.</p>
