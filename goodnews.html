          <p>The German economy saw a surprising 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis).

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced a 7% decrease in the energy price cap, marking the first drop in a year and providing some relief for households. This change means a typical household will see an annual bill reduction of ¬£129, affecting 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite the welcome reduction, charities emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, with significant customer debt to suppliers. The drop reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, although prices remain higher than previous years.</p>

          <p>BYD has overtaken Tesla in European battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the first time, despite hefty tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. BYD sold 7,231 BEVs in April, a 169% year-on-year increase, while Tesla's sales fell 49% to 7,165 units. This milestone marks a significant shift in Europe's car market, as Tesla has led the BEV market for years. Chinese carmakers' BEV sales jumped 59% year-on-year in April, contributing to the growth in BEV adoption in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Maya Ixil community in Guatemala is mobilizing against transnational corporations that have invaded their ancestral land to install hydroelectric plants. This community, which suffered a massacre in 1982, now fights to protect its territory in the Quich√© region. The article highlights the lack of consultation with indigenous communities before implementing these projects. Leaders like Concepci√≥n Santay G√≥mez are traveling internationally to raise awareness and demand respect for their rights and natural resources.</p>
