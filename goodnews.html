        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump Treasury Department has implemented new sanctions targeting key members of the Cartel del Noreste (CDN), identified as a foreign terrorist organization. These sanctions aim to block the U.S. assets of Miguel Angel de Anda Ledezma and Ricardo Gonzalez Sauceda, disrupting CDN's violent activities, including intimidation, kidnapping, and terrorism along the southern border. According to Paul Perez of the National Border Patrol Council, these actions create a power vacuum within the cartel, potentially leading to infighting and weakening the organization. He emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to protecting American citizens and decimating cartel activity. The sanctions are viewed as a significant step in addressing the threat posed by cartels to border security and public safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. This arrangement, reversing Biden's block on Nippon Steel's bid, is projected to create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel confirmed its commitment to protecting American workers and national security, while U.S. Steel's CEO previously warned that blocking the deal could lead to the company pivoting away from Pittsburgh. While the specifics of the partnership remain unclear, the announcement caused U.S. Steel shares to jump, and Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meme coin dinner, an exclusive event for top holders of his cryptocurrency, has been criticized for its underwhelming experience despite the opulence on display. Attendees who spent a combined $148 million on the token reported that "the food sucked" and that security was lax. Trump made a brief appearance, re-hashing crypto talking points, but did not interact with most guests. Some attendees expressed disappointment and noted that many were checking their phones during the dinner to monitor the coin's price, which had plunged 16% that morning.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, leading to walking difficulties, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition, which is more common with age, is often underdiagnosed due to its symptoms being mistaken for normal aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that drains excess fluid, and physical therapy to improve gait stability. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment, with surgery potentially reversing symptoms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. Judge John Bates found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments, characterizing parts of it as a "screed" expressing animosity towards the firm. The order, which instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances and terminate government contracts, was seen as retaliation for the firm's legal challenges against Trump's policies. The ruling marks the second legal setback for the administration in its efforts to punish law firms critical of its policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing a previous decision by President Biden to block the acquisition on national security grounds. Trump announced the planned partnership, stating it will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. The decision follows a new review of the proposed acquisition by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate the agreement.</p>

          <p>A two-month-old black bear cub, rescued after being found alone and starving in a California forest, is now being raised by wildlife staff at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center. Staff are using enrichment sessions, including dressing as bears, to mimic maternal behavior and prepare the cub for a future return to the wild. The goal is to minimize human interaction to prevent conflicts once the cub is released. The cub, believed to be the youngest the organization has cared for, is thriving after more than a month of around-the-clock care.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind a ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù between US Steel and Nippon Steel, months after insisting he was ‚Äútotally against‚Äù a $14.9bn bid by the Japanese firm for its US rival. The US president stopped short of an all-out endorsement of the takeover, he announced a deal between the two businesses on social media. Under the arrangement announced by Trump, US Steel would remain in the US, with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, he stressed, announcing plans to hold a ‚Äúbig rally‚Äù in the state next week.</p>
