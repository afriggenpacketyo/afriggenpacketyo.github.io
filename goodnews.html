          <p>Spanish and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has made history by winning the women's Ballon d'Or for an unprecedented third time, solidifying her status as a dominant force in world football. The 27-year-old secured the prestigious award ahead of her international teammate Mariona Caldentey. Bonmati's win continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players receiving the honor, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022. Despite a season where her club and country missed the biggest prizes, her individual brilliance, including being named UEFA's Champions League player of the season, was recognized by the jury of journalists.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé, once the world's second most expensive player, has fulfilled long-held predictions by winning the men's Ballon d'Or, capping a remarkable career transformation. After years of battling injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, the 28-year-old flourished at Paris St-Germain, scoring 35 goals in a treble-winning season. His success was catalyzed by a tactical shift to a more central, goal-scoring role following Kylian Mbappé's departure, as well as personal maturation after his marriage and the birth of his child. This achievement marks a significant turnaround from a career previously defined by unfulfilled potential.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after being indefinitely suspended. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and led major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to drop the program. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," calling some of the host's comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The company stated the decision to resume the show came after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its newest class of 10 astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, is composed of six pilots, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon under the Artemis program, and potentially Mars. The selection comes at a time of uncertainty for NASA, with budget cuts and the planned retirement of the ISS.</p>

          <p>England's Hannah Hampton has been named the world's best female goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards, a remarkable achievement for an athlete who was told as a child she should not play football due to a serious eye condition. Despite ongoing depth perception issues from strabismus, the 24-year-old played a pivotal role in Chelsea's domestic treble and England's Euro 2025 victory with crucial penalty shootout saves. Her journey to the top has included overcoming career setbacks, such as being temporarily dropped from the national squad, demonstrating resilience and a determination to prove doubters wrong.</p>

          <p>An expedition in the Solomon Islands has discovered a massive coral colony of the species Pavona clavus, now considered the largest single underwater organism ever recorded. The coral, estimated to be around 300 years old, measures approximately 112 by 105 feet and is large enough to be seen from space. Led by a partnership including National Geographic Pristine Seas, the team found the giant coral to be in good health, a positive sign amidst global concerns over climate change impacting reef ecosystems. This discovery underscores the importance of local conservation efforts and the wonders still hidden within the ocean's depths.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a new ownership structure for TikTok's U.S. operations, which it claims will satisfy national security concerns and prevent a ban of the app. The plan involves creating a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive security oversight, including for the app's powerful algorithm. A senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, although Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The move aims to resolve the long-standing dispute over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis, with estimated payments about $7 to $10 less than a comparable home equity loan. However, homeowners must consider that HELOCs have variable interest rates that can change over time, whereas home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against Orsted's Revolution Wind project, allowing the Danish renewable energy company to resume construction. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the nearly completed project off the New England coast, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a temporary injunction, stating that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit and would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has declared that his party has a moral obligation to prevent Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party from gaining power. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey positioned the Liberal Democrats as the true alternative for voters disillusioned with both the Labour and Conservative parties. He argued that Farage aims to reshape the UK in the mold of "Trump's America," which he described as harsh and contrary to British values. Davey contrasted this with his party's vision for a "decent, caring country" offering radical but principled change.</p>
