          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737, traveling from Denver to Los Angeles, was forced to make an emergency diversion to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in one of the windshield's layers. The flight was carrying 134 passengers and six crew members, all of whom landed safely and were transferred to another aircraft to complete their journey. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident and will examine the damaged windscreen to determine the cause of the crack. Officials noted the multilayered windshield is specifically designed to maintain integrity even if one layer is compromised.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia, who missed a full year with an ACL injury, scored a spectacular winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham. The substitute's goal capped a remarkable return to form, with three goals and an assist in his last four appearances, helping his team secure a third consecutive league win. Buendia, once the club's record signing, had struggled for opportunities after his injury and was even loaned out last season. His determination to stay and fight for his place now appears to be paying off, providing a much-needed boost for Villa after a difficult start to their season.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter used her dual role as host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" to address criticism of her provocative public persona and album art. Through several sketches, including one where she played an oblivious designer of a pillow resembling female genitalia, she playfully challenged the idea that her sexuality is problematic. Her performance was interpreted as a commentary on the scrutiny faced by young female artists who embrace a more adult image after starting as child stars. The appearance effectively served as a witty rebuttal to her critics, questioning why her confident and sometimes bawdy persona is considered controversial.</p>

          <p>In a significant political shift, moderate, centre-left politician Tufan Erhuman won the Turkish Cypriot presidential election, defeating the hardline incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhuman campaigned on a platform of reinvigorating stalled UN-led talks to reunify the divided island of Cyprus, pledging to explore a federal solution. His victory could create a new opening for diplomacy, as the previous leadership, backed by Turkey, had advocated for a two-state policy rejected by Greek Cypriots. The island has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion, and this election result offers a potential path toward resolving the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team clinched a place in the Women's World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. Chasing 289 to win, India appeared to be in a commanding position but collapsed after the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana for 88. England's total was built on a masterful century by former captain Heather Knight, who scored 100 runs off 86 balls. Despite a late charge from India's Deepti Sharma, England's bowlers held their nerve in the final over to secure the critical win, while India now faces a difficult path to advance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>In a recent analysis following a trip to San Francisco, insights were shared regarding major trends in the technology and artificial intelligence sectors based on conversations with prominent CEOs. The report suggests that Salesforce's AI platform is showing real-world utility, potentially boosting its revenue growth and dispelling skepticism about its value. It also notes that while there is growing concern over OpenAI's spending, Broadcom's CEO remains a firm believer in their partnership. The article concludes that the AI buildout is not a zero-sum game, with room for companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to thrive simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams secured a decisive 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London, improving their record to 5-2. Quarterback Matthew Stafford was exceptional, throwing for five touchdowns, three of which were caught by receiver Davante Adams, even without the team's star receiver Puka Nacua, who was out with an injury. The Rams' defense was equally dominant, sacking Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence seven times throughout the game. This strong performance marks the Rams' best start since their Super Bowl-winning season in 2021 and sends them into their bye week with significant momentum.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured a direct radio image of two supermassive black holes orbiting each other, confirming a long-held scientific theory. The pair was discovered inside the quasar OJ287, located five billion light-years away, and consists of a smaller black hole orbiting a colossal one with a mass 18 billion times that of the sun. The breakthrough was achieved by combining data from Earth-based radio telescopes with the Russian RadioAstron satellite, creating an image with extraordinary clarity. This observation provides crucial evidence for how galaxies and their central supermassive black holes evolve through mergers.</p>

          <p>According to a World Health Organization report, smoking prevalence in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades, dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. This success is attributed to strong public health initiatives, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces in most countries in the region. However, the fight is not over, as the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and Indonesia remains a major outlier with high smoking rates and significant tobacco industry influence. Furthermore, the rapid rise of e-cigarettes and vaping presents a new public health challenge, particularly among adolescents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers to resume processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers in two income-driven repayment plans. The administration had previously paused cancellations under the Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay as You Earn plans, arguing it was required by a court order that halted a separate Biden-era program. This reversal reopens a path to debt relief for millions of borrowers and is being hailed as a major victory for public service workers. The agreement also clarifies that loan forgiveness received in 2025 will not be subject to federal taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills ahead of the November budget. While not confirming the policy, Miliband acknowledged the country is facing a severe "cost-of-living crisis" and that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief. The government is under pressure to reduce high energy costs, which have remained elevated since the 2021 price spike. Scrapping the VAT on energy could save the average household around £86 per year, offering a potential measure to ease financial strain on consumers.</p>
