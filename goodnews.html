          <p>Drawing on research into historical resistance against Nazism, the author suggests that the US left can learn valuable lessons for effective opposition. The author emphasizes the importance of laser-focused action to create change, rather than relying on attention-grabbing but less impactful gestures. The author also highlights the need for self-scrutiny and empathy, urging the left to embrace those who may have been misled by far-right leaders. This approach emphasizes creating a better future for everyone, not just defeating the enemy.</p>

          <p>Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, discusses the economic theory behind Trumpism and the shift in conservative economic thinking. He argues that the Republican Party has been too focused on corporate interests and market fundamentalism, advocating for a reset that embraces American manufacturing and empowers workers. Cass believes that the right has been blind to these issues, and that a new economic populism is needed.

The piece also highlights Lou Gehrig's grace and courage in the face of his terminal illness, demonstrating how responses to failure can be more enduring than statistical achievements.
