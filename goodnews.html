          <p>The contest to replace Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader is already revealing potential friction for Keir Starmer's government. Candidates from outside the cabinet, such as Emily Thornberry, are using the platform to voice criticism on issues like welfare, Gaza, and a wealth tax, signaling they won't simply "nod along" with the government line. This public debate among senior party figures could create awkward political dynamics for the leadership. The race's tight timetable for securing nominations has also drawn criticism from some contenders, highlighting internal party tensions.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Tsurkov, an Israeli-Russian academic and Princeton graduate student, has been released after being held captive by the militant group Kata’ib Hezbollah for over two years. President Donald Trump announced her release, stating she was tortured for months and is now safe at the American Embassy in Iraq. Tsurkov was abducted in Baghdad in March 2023 while conducting research for her doctorate. Her sister expressed immense gratitude to President Trump and the U.S. officials who worked to secure her freedom after 903 days of captivity.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants, yielding to customer feedback just weeks after reversing a controversial logo change. The company had faced intense criticism from some customers and conservative figures who accused it of going "woke" for attempting to modernize its brand. In a statement, the company affirmed its commitment to its traditional "Old Country Store" aesthetic, including rocking chairs and fireplaces. This decision reinforces that the brand is prioritizing its established customer base's preferences over its recent rebranding efforts.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in “Breaking Bad,” was taken into custody for five hours following a dispute with three women over a parking spot. Cruz was washing his car when the women parked very close to him and began recording him after he asked them to move. His agent claims that while telling them to stop, water from the hose may have inadvertently splashed on them. The women reported an alleged assault to the police, but Cruz's representative characterized the event as a misunderstanding and expects the case to be dropped.</p>

          <p>Six Labour MPs have entered the contest to become the party's next deputy leader, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently leading in nominations from fellow MPs. The candidates, who also include Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry, must secure 80 MP backers by Thursday to proceed to a vote by party members. The tight timetable has drawn criticism from some, like left-wing candidate Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who argues it is unfair. The race is seen as influential for the future direction of the Labour government, with the winner to be announced on October 25.</p>

          <p>Thomas Kurian, the head of Google Cloud, detailed how the company is successfully generating billions in revenue from its artificial intelligence products. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, Kurian explained a multi-faceted monetization strategy that includes consumption-based pricing for AI models and infrastructure, where customers pay per token used. The strategy also relies on monthly subscription fees for products like Google Workspace and upselling customers to higher-priced, more capable AI tiers.

          <p>Nottingham Forest has swiftly appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new manager, just hours after the departure of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno's exit followed a period of public friction with the club's ownership over the pace of transfer business, which created what was seen as unnecessary disruption. Postecoglou, who was recently sacked by Tottenham, has an existing positive relationship with Forest's owner, Evangelos Marinakis. The club has stated that the new manager has the credentials to help them build on their recent success and begin challenging for trophies.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement, backed by Egypt, to resume cooperation on nuclear monitoring. This development paves the way for the potential relaunch of inspections at Iran's nuclear facilities, which were suspended following a war with Israel in June. The agreement comes as European powers are moving to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. IAEA inspectors have been unable to verify Iran's stockpile of near bomb-grade uranium since the conflict, a situation the agency described as a "matter of serious concern."</p>
