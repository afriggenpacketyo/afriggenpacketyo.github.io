          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to become a hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Sunday, Barbara was located about 170 miles southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and moving west-northwest at 12 mph. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, portions of Mexico's western states may experience two to four inches of rainfall, leading to potential flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the southwestern coast. NOAA officials have predicted a 60% chance of an above-normal hurricane season.

          <p>The government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, potentially including a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 22:00 curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle mentioned the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones as a concern. An online safety campaigner, Ian Russell, whose daughter took her own life after seeing harmful content online, criticized the government for delaying the implementation of tougher online safety laws. While parental controls and screen time limits are already available on some platforms, the government is exploring additional measures to ensure a healthy online life for children.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, common relationship conflicts include tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, and can be addressed by naming the effect and giving the partner a chance to correct. Family relation arguments often reflect unmet needs and value clashes, requiring reassurance and setting limits as a team. Disputes over chores often stem from an uneven distribution of labor and the unacknowledged "invisible load," which can be resolved by naming the load and redistributing tasks. Communication style arguments can be navigated using the "five-second rule" and striving for mutual understanding. The optimism score is not found in this summary.</p>

          <p>Despite Germany's 2-0 defeat to France in the Nations League third-place playoff, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen emerged as a bright spot, making several excellent saves. The loss highlighted both the good and bad aspects of Julian Nagelsmann's developing team, with a lack of clinical finishing remaining a concern. Ter Stegen, now the first-choice goalkeeper following Manuel Neuer's retirement, faces an uncertain future at Barcelona, where he has been largely ignored in favor of Wojciech Szczesny. Reports suggest that Ter Stegen is willing to fight for his place at the club, despite the potential signing of another goalkeeper. The optimism score is not found in this summary.</p>
