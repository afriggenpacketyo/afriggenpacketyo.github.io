          <p>Charles Rangel, a former New York representative and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, chairing the House Ways and Means Committee for a time. His career included notable achievements and a public censure for violating House rules, though he remained widely respected and continued to serve in Congress.

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh aimed to challenge negative perceptions of sharks, which he believes were unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws." He emphasized the critical role sharks play in maintaining a healthy ocean ecosystem, stating that around 100 million sharks are killed each year, an unsustainable rate. Pugh endured frigid waters and harsh weather during the 12-day swim, accompanied by safety personnel and a "Shark Shield" device.</p>
