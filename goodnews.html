          <h2>Opinion Piece Highlights Dangers of Focusing AI Development Solely on US and China</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece cautions against framing the artificial intelligence race as solely between the United States and China, emphasizing the risks of unchecked AI development, such as the loss of human control over autonomous weapons and potential manipulation. The article argues that an AI race without proper consideration for safety and ethical guidelines could lead to a global 'lose-lose' scenario. It also notes that focusing solely on these two nations neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and corporations that are not fully aligned with either Beijing or Washington. The author asserts that while AI model training is resource-intensive, model performance is only one part of the equation.</p>

          <p>Equipment issues caused ground stops at Newark Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International airports on Sunday, leading to flight delays and cancellations. The FAA reported that technicians were addressing the problem in Newark, which appeared to stem from a communications system in Philadelphia. A runway equipment issue and weather also caused delays in Atlanta. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce traffic load at Newark by installing a new communications line and emphasized that backup systems ensure safety. Duffy also stated that the new communications line is scheduled to be completed by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the US and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war, as high-level talks concluded in Geneva, Switzerland. The treasury secretary did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also praised the "important progress" from the talk, and told reporters in Geneva that the meetings had been substantive. An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he will use as Air Force One, four sources familiar with the planning confirmed to NBC News. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move. The administration will retrofit the plane so it can be used in Trump's official capacity as president. The plane, a Boeing 747-8 jet, is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term, two sources confirmed to NBC.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, sources told CBS News. But the plane, a 747-8, won't be ready to serve as Air Force One quite yet, and Mr. Trump won't be using it to fly back to the U.S. from the Middle East. The plane needs to be checked for security and spying devices before it is accepted, one of the sources told CBS News. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York confirmed to CBS News that he sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office urging an investigation into the Trump administration accepting a plane as a gift.</p>

Real Madrid are expected to be Alexander-Arnold's next club. And a section of the Liverpool support took their first chance to let him know their feelings about his decision, booing him during the draw with Arsenal.</p>
