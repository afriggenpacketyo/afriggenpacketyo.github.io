        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have heightened their scrutiny of Greenland, driven by President Trump's renewed interest in acquiring the island and Vice President Vance's visit to a U.S. military base there. Intelligence reports about Greenland, strategically located in the Arctic Circle and rich in rare earth minerals, are increasingly circulating within the executive branch and Congress. Danish officials have reacted negatively to the increased intelligence collection, with some suggesting the closure of a consulate. While much of the intelligence work is based on open-source information, the White House remains concerned about security in the Arctic and potential encroachment by China and Russia on American interests.</p>

The decision comes after discussions following the 2021 Olympics, with Bird serving on the board and considering the managing director role. Her term will last four years, aligning with the Olympic cycle, and she will be responsible for selecting the coaching staff and players for upcoming events, including the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, challenging incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff in the 2026 election. Carter's announcement follows Governor Brian Kemp's decision not to run for the seat, opening the door for other Republicans to enter the primary. Carter is positioning himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump, focusing on cultural issues such as transgender rights to contrast himself with Ossoff. Carter's campaign will include television ads highlighting his support for Trump and his opposition to Ossoff's policies, framing the election as a choice between a 'MAGA warrior' and a 'trans warrior'.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that he will announce a replacement for Ed Martin, his controversial choice for interim U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia, due to Martin's lack of Senate support. Martin, a 'Stop the Steal' activist, was appointed on an interim basis and can serve until May 20. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, publicly stated he would not vote to advance Martin's nomination, leading to Trump's decision to seek a new candidate. Trump hopes to find another position for Martin within the Justice Department.</p>

The Microsoft co-founder, currently the world's fifth-richest person, aims to give away virtually all of his wealth, with the Gates Foundation set to close by the end of 2045.

          <p>The US and the UK have reached an agreement over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, although US President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. The deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Car tariffs cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US has been scrapped as part of this deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home working appears to have led to a more significant decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London, according to a Lords committee. Pub spending data suggests that in London, post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday, but a similar shift is not seen in other large British cities, where spending in bars is more likely to shift into the weekend. A decline in city-center spending has not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centers. The data analyzed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialize than in the capital.</p>

It is also supported by a pro-crypto administration and buying from spot-ETF investors, and is resilient versus U.S. equity benchmarks.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Ed Martin will not be the nominee for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing a lack of support from key senators. Martin's defense of January 6 rioters and inflammatory rhetoric surrounding the Capitol attack had plagued his nomination. Trump expressed disappointment but indicated that he would soon announce a new nominee for the role. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney, which began upon Trump's inauguration, is set to expire on May 20.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Starmer. The agreement includes billions of dollars of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol. While the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing 25% rates. This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, appearing on "The View," criticized President Trump's second term, calling it the "worst 100 days any president's ever had".

Biden expressed disappointment but not surprise at Vice President Kamala Harris' loss, attributing it to sexist attacks. The Bidens pushed back against reports claiming cognitive decline and rejected accusations that Jill Biden was isolating Joe from allies and the public.</p>
