        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has suspended the "Voice of Freedom," a long-running military propaganda radio broadcast aimed at North Korea. The decision is part of a broader series of measures by the current administration to de-escalate military tensions with its nuclear-armed neighbor. The broadcast, which first aired in 1962, transmitted outside information and K-pop music into the isolated state. This move follows other recent actions, such as halting propaganda from loudspeakers along the border, in an effort to improve inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>Newcastle has agreed to a deal worth £55 million to sign forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford, just a day after the player publicly stated his desire to leave the club. The transfer, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, comes as Newcastle seeks to bolster its attack following the record sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, accused Brentford of unfairly blocking his move before talks resumed and an agreement was reached. The DR Congo international is now set to complete the formalities of his move to St James' Park.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of funded childcare support has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-paid care per week for children aged nine months to four years. While the program is expected to save families thousands of pounds annually, its rollout is facing significant hurdles. Parents report encountering long waiting lists for nursery places, and providers warn that persistent staff shortages are severely limiting their capacity to meet the surge in demand. Some parents have even taken extreme measures, such as scheduling C-sections to meet eligibility deadlines for the funding.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have overwhelmingly voted to unionize, with over 97% of ballots cast in favor. The move to join the National Federation of Federal Employees comes after mass firings and proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration, which have led to rock-bottom morale and fears of job insecurity. Workers, including rangers and firefighters, also cite long-standing issues such as low pay and poor housing conditions as reasons for organizing, hoping the union will provide greater protection and a stronger voice for their concerns.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new David Geffen Galleries building is seeing its first art installation, a commissioned photo sculpture by artist Todd Gray titled “Octavia Butler’s Gaze.” The article details the process of mounting the piece on the building's massive concrete walls, which are being treated with a unique colored glazing technique instead of paint. This approach is part of the new building's design philosophy, which will feature a non-chronological, interconnected presentation of the museum's collection when it opens in April 2026. The installation marks a significant milestone in the building's progress.</p>

          <p>A former Macy's parking structure at the now-defunct Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a 201-unit luxury apartment complex. The project, named Overland & Ayres, is part of a growing trend of repurposing obsolete retail centers for new uses, particularly housing. The rest of the iconic mall, famous for its appearance in the film "Clueless," is being converted by UCLA into a major research facility. The new apartments offer high-end amenities and represent a significant step in the redevelopment of the once-thriving shopping destination.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The emergency injunction was sought by immigrant advocacy groups who claimed the children were being put on planes in Texas to be sent back to Guatemala, where they could face harm. The administration argued the flights were for family reunification at the request of the Guatemalan government, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers. The order will remain in place for 14 days while the case is reviewed.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created the world's first elastic, rubber-like material that can efficiently convert body heat into electricity. This breakthrough in thermoelectric materials could pave the way for self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, that would be powered by the temperature difference between the human body and the surrounding environment. The development addresses a key challenge in the field, as previous high-performance thermoelectric materials were flexible but not truly elastic, limiting their practical application in wearable technology.</p>
