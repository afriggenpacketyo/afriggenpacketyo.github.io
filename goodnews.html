          <p>In a recent interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris suggested she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign and asserted that her warnings about Donald Trump's presidency have proven correct, calling him a "tyrant." Despite her comments, recent polling in her home state of California shows limited support for a 2028 bid, with fewer than a third of voters endorsing another attempt. The White House dismissed her assertions, stating the American people "don't care about her absurd lies."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 12:40:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular passive investment strategy known as "VOO and chill," which involves buying broad market index ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, is reportedly losing its appeal. Some financial experts observe that investors are increasingly seeking diversification that they feel is lacking in major indexes, which are heavily weighted towards technology stocks. The tech sector now comprises a record 35% of the S&P 500, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weighting. Consequently, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing electronics, electric vehicles, and military technology. The announcement follows China's recent implementation of new export curbs on these materials, a move that has disrupted global manufacturing and is seen as leveraging its dominant market position. The EU is exploring short-term solutions with Beijing but is also preparing to use its "toolbox to respond if needed." The long-term strategy includes increasing recycling, domestic production, and forming partnerships with other resource-rich countries.</p>

          <h2>Mark Cuban Suggests Buying Consumables in Bulk Can Be a Better Investment Than Picking Stocks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 12:01:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban advises that for the average person, one of the best financial moves is not picking stocks but buying household consumables in bulk. He argues that it's difficult to consistently choose the right stock or fund, but saving money on everyday items like toilet paper and toothpaste provides a guaranteed return. Cuban illustrates that saving 40% on a $2,000 annual budget for such items yields $800 in savings, which he calls a practical and effective investment. He also cautions against using credit cards for these purchases, emphasizing that the savings are only realized if not offset by interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>One Year After Historic Dam Removal, Klamath River Shows Signs of Rapid Recovery</h2>

          <p>A year after the removal of the final hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River—the largest such project in U.S. history—the ecosystem is showing remarkable signs of healing. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning. The restoration was celebrated by a 30-day, 310-mile kayak journey by Indigenous youth, the first to navigate the full river in more than 100 years. This successful project is now serving as a global model for river restoration and Indigenous-led environmental stewardship, demonstrating that large-scale ecosystem recovery is possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new record highs this week, rising over 2%, as market focus shifted from political drama to positive economic indicators. A key driver was the September Consumer Price Index report, which showed inflation rising less than expected, increasing the likelihood of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The market was also bolstered by a strong earnings season, with 87% of reporting S&P 500 companies beating expectations so far. Positive results from companies like Danaher, Capital One, and Honeywell contributed to the week's upward momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, holds a significant place in U.S. history and is also known for its reported hauntings. Completed in 1801, the building temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison and First Lady Dolley Madison after the White House was burned in 1814. It was in this house that Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812. Over the years, staff and visitors have reported unexplained phenomena, such as doors opening on their own and the scent of lilacs associated with Dolley Madison. The historic building is now a museum undergoing renovations.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael, conceded the election. While vote counting was still ongoing, Humphreys congratulated Connolly, stating she "will be a president for all of us." The presidency is a largely ceremonial role in Ireland. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker, gained the backing of several left-leaning parties and has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced for two closely watched races: the New York City mayoral election and the New Jersey gubernatorial contest. New Yorkers are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo. In New Jersey, the race is between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. These off-year elections are seen as potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of progressive versus establishment candidates. Key issues in both campaigns have included affordability, cost of living, and internal party divisions. Early voting will continue until early November.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a bionic jellyfish robot, described as an "underwater phantom," designed for stealthy deep-sea surveillance. The small, transparent robot, made from a special hydrogel material, closely mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish. Its design allows for near-silent operation and low power consumption, making it ideal for covert monitoring, inspecting underwater structures, and observing fragile ecosystems without causing disturbances. The drone was developed by a team at Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xian and represents an advancement in biomimetic robotic technology for underwater applications.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his mansion in Hunts Point, a Seattle suburb, for $63 million, realizing a profit of over $25 million from his 2019 purchase price. This move comes two years after he relocated to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez, and as his ownership stake in Amazon has dipped below 10%. The sale also occurs amidst a continuing legal dispute with Sánchez's brother, Michael Sánchez, over the leak of their private texts in 2019. Bezos's legal team is seeking to have Michael Sánchez cover over $190,000 in legal fees from a related defamation lawsuit.</p>
