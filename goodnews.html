          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China continue to purchase gold jewelry, particularly for traditional wedding ceremonies. Prices have surged over 48% this year, reaching US$3,883 per ounce, yet demand for items like dragon and phoenix bracelets remains strong. According to retailers like Chow Tai Fook, consumers have gradually adapted to the new, higher price levels. This sustained demand highlights the cultural significance of gold, which outweighs price sensitivity for major life events like weddings.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in "Breaking Bad," will not face criminal charges following a confrontation at his Silver Lake home. The Los Angeles city attorney's office declined to file charges after three women accused Cruz of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his car. Cruz's agent stated the women parked extremely close to his vehicle and began recording him after he asked them to move. The agent suggested any water spray was incidental and not intentional.</p>

          <p>The 133-year-old coffee brand Maxwell House has launched a viral marketing campaign that humorously rebrands itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee." The tongue-in-cheek ads directly address the ongoing housing affordability crisis in the United States, where the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached a record high of 38. The campaign aims to connect with a growing population of renters by acknowledging their economic realities. It reflects a broader societal trend of unaffordability that has made homeownership increasingly difficult for younger generations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again dismissed a lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and caused him lifelong harm. However, the judge ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the photo pornographic, comparing it to a typical family photo of a nude child. This marks the second time the case has been thrown out, with lawyers for the band calling the lawsuit meritless.</p>

          <p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has become the first person in history to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion. The milestone was reached as the stock value of Tesla, along with valuations of his other companies like xAI and SpaceX, has continued to climb. This achievement solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest individual, significantly ahead of his closest competitors. Musk's fortune is closely tied to his stake in Tesla, whose shares have risen over 20% this year amid investor optimism.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police arrested six people who trespassed and attempted to hang a large banner on the iconic Hollywood sign. The group was detained without incident on Sunday afternoon as they tried to affix the banner to one of the sign's "O" letters. The full message or purpose of the banner was not clear, though a photo shared by the LAPD showed it included an image of a green-and-white pill capsule. The investigation has been handed over to L.A. city park rangers for further action.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from diverting $34 million in anti-terrorism funding for New York's transportation system. The state of New York sued after the administration announced cuts, arguing the move was punishment for the city's non-cooperation with federal deportation programs. The judge ruled that New York would likely succeed in proving the funds were being improperly diverted, citing the city's history as a primary target for terrorism. The ruling temporarily safeguards funds intended to protect the transit system from major threats.</p>

          <p>China's three largest cities have introduced new policies to ease property restrictions in an effort to stabilize the struggling real estate sector and boost the national economy. Analysts believe that shoring up the property market is crucial for improving consumer sentiment, as the industry's slump has had a wide-ranging negative impact on dozens of related sectors. While the measures may lead to short-term regional rebounds, experts caution against expecting a quick, nationwide recovery. The government continues to grapple with the effects of the prolonged property crisis on overall economic growth.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders used a novel approach to handle media questions about his position on the team's depth chart by remaining completely silent. When asked about fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel being promoted to starting quarterback while he remained third-string, Sanders moved his mouth and gestured as if answering but produced no sound. This pantomimed response came after Sanders had previously made comments suggesting he was capable of playing better than many current NFL quarterbacks. His silent protest is being interpreted as a creative way to avoid controversy or fines.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to look at the market's top-performing stocks from the third quarter as a guide for the remainder of the year. He noted that fund managers often buy these recent winners to bolster their portfolios, suggesting that companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Warner Bros. Discovery could see continued gains. However, Cramer cautioned that while these stocks may continue to inch higher, the most significant gains for the year may have already occurred. His analysis pointed to the AI boom and potential corporate takeovers as key drivers for some of the quarter's biggest winners. (not investment advice)</p>

Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy and are high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats when used to replace saturated fats like butter. The article also clarifies that modern margarines are safe and can help reduce bad cholesterol, and that while extra virgin olive oil is not ideal for deep frying due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying.</p>
