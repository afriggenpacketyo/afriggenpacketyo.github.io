          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Trump announced he has started organizing a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump stated that after this bilateral meeting, he would join for trilateral talks, framing it as a significant step toward peace. This development came after Trump reversed his previous stance, suggesting that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, a position that contrasts with the views of European allies who are pushing for an immediate halt to the fighting.</p>

          <p>Leeds United celebrated their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Everton, driven by the intense atmosphere at their Elland Road stadium. The decisive moment came late in the game when Lukas Nmecha converted a controversial penalty, awarded for a handball by Everton's James Tarkowski. Despite dominating the first half, Leeds struggled to score from open play but ultimately secured the win through defensive resilience and the late spot-kick. The victory provides a crucial and optimistic start to their campaign to remain in the top flight.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay homeowners at least 2% interest on insurance payouts held in escrow after a natural disaster. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds, intended for rebuilding, into an account and keep the interest earned, which could be significant as rebuilding can take years. The legislation aims to close a loophole and provide additional financial support to homeowners struggling to recover and rebuild their lives after catastrophic events like wildfires, ensuring they receive all available resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League season opener between Leeds and Everton was decided by a contentious penalty, igniting debate over the handball rule. Everton defender James Tarkowski was penalized when a powerful shot struck his arm, which was positioned close to his body, leading to the game's only goal. While pundits and players were divided, the referee's decision stood, with some arguing Tarkowski leaned into the ball, making his body "unnaturally bigger." The incident highlights the ongoing confusion surrounding the interpretation of handball rules in modern football.</p>

          <p>During a high-level meeting at the White House, key European leaders urged former President Trump to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine before advancing peace negotiations with Russia. Leaders from Germany, France, and the UK emphasized that any peace deal must include robust, "Article 5-like" security guarantees to prevent future aggression. The collective European stance highlighted a potential rift with Trump, who recently downplayed the necessity of an immediate ceasefire after his summit with Vladimir Putin, creating a complex diplomatic landscape for the ongoing peace efforts.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the geopolitical significance of China's plan to build a new, large-scale embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that the dispute over the project is a microcosm of the complex UK-China relationship, with the grand scale of the proposed diplomatic hub serving as a powerful symbol of China's rising global status. While the plan has faced political opposition citing security risks, the article suggests that China's commitment to such a significant physical presence signals London's continued importance as a key global capital.</p>

          <p>Iowa State Representative J.D. Scholten has suspended his campaign for the 2026 U.S. Senate Democratic primary. He has endorsed fellow Democratic Representative Josh Turek, calling him the "best hope" to challenge the Republican incumbent, Senator Joni Ernst. Turek recently joined a crowded primary field aiming to unseat Ernst, who has not yet formally announced her bid for a third term but is actively fundraising. The move consolidates some support within the Democratic party as they prepare for a challenging race in a state that has trended Republican.</p>

In contrast to a tense visit six months prior, Zelenskyy wore a formal suit and engaged in lighthearted banter, appearing to have learned from past interactions with the former US leader. This charm offensive included personal gestures, such as delivering a letter from his wife to Melania Trump, signaling a deliberate effort to build rapport and navigate the delicate diplomatic relationship more effectively.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction to stop the Federal Trade Commission from investigating the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report alleging that antisemitic content on the social media platform X appeared alongside major brand advertisements. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation was a likely violation of the group's First Amendment rights, stating that it appeared to be a form of government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech.</p>
