          <p>Dave's Hot Chicken, a franchise business that began as a chicken finger stand in an LA parking lot with just $900, has sold a majority stake to Roark Capital in a deal worth nearly $1 billion. The business was founded in 2017 by Arman Oganesyan and his friends Dave Kopushyan and Tommy Rubenyan. The initial idea was met with skepticism but the founders developed a Nashville hot chicken recipe and gained popularity, leading to the opening of their first storefront a year later. It is an entrepreneurial success story.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer and Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Wells Fargo's future following the Federal Reserve's removal of the bank's $1.95 trillion asset cap. Cramer called the removal a "watershed moment" and raised his price target on the stock, citing the bank's ability to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth areas, and reduce compliance costs. Wall Street firms such as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have also become more positive on Wells Fargo, anticipating multi-year growth and increased efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require American medical schools to offer nutrition courses to students or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy expressed concern that medical schools primarily teach how to treat illnesses with drugs rather than with food and preventative measures. The HHS official said Kennedy "is committed to understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease, which includes fresh thinking on nutrition and over-reliance on medication and treatments." Some medical schools have responded by highlighting their existing nutrition programs.</p>
