          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States might extend its 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue in good faith. Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, suggested a willingness to push the deadline beyond early July for countries actively engaged in talks. President Trump later mentioned he didn't think an extension would be necessary, creating some uncertainty regarding the administration's stance. Japan, facing an additional 14 percent country-specific tariff, is among the countries actively negotiating with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is reviewing the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with President Trump's "America First" agenda. This review, led by Elbridge Colby, who has previously criticized Aukus, aims to ensure the highest readiness of U.S. servicemembers and that allies fully contribute to collective defense. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, stating it is normal for a new administration to reassess agreements. The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, is intended to counter China's growing power by providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from museum specimens in Mongolia, which is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs. The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants like T. rex. Khankhuuluu, meaning Dragon Prince of Mongolia, weighed about 750kg and exhibits early stages of key tyrannosaur features, including skull anatomy for a strong jaw. This discovery has helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite the understanding of their evolution.</p>

The judge paused the injunction to allow the government time to appeal. Khalil was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war, making his case a high-profile one.</p>
