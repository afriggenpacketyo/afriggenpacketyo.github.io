          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks clinched a thrilling 94-91 win against the Seattle Storm, thanks to a game-winning layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining. The Sparks overcame a significant 16-point first-quarter deficit, mounting a comeback fueled by a stellar all-around performance from Kelsey Plum, who recorded 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. The victory marks the Sparks' ninth win in their last 11 games, strengthening their position in the playoff race. The intense, back-and-forth contest highlighted the team's resilience and competitive hunger as they continue their strong mid-season run in the WNBA.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a major road safety overhaul, the UK government is considering a proposal to require drivers over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests every three years to renew their licenses. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" licensing system after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight. The new strategy, expected in the autumn, may also include tightening the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The government aims to reduce road fatalities and injuries through these tougher regulations and enforcement measures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article by physicist Frank Wilczek explores the concept of gravitational waves emitted by newly formed black holes, describing them as a form of "strange, pure music." While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the process of their formation—such as from a star's collapse or the merger of two smaller black holes—causes the surrounding space-time to vibrate. These vibrations, or "ringdown," quickly settle into a stable, mathematically perfect shape defined only by the black hole's mass and spin. These gravitational wave signals provide a unique way for scientists to observe and understand these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

          <p>China's new nationwide childcare subsidy program, which offers families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three, is expected to have a varied impact across the country. According to analysis, the subsidy will be most significant in less affluent regions where the payment represents a much larger percentage of the average resident's income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai. This structure could lead to a more noticeable boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is aggressively pivoting the Japanese conglomerate to focus on artificial intelligence, driven by his belief that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will arrive within a decade. Son's strategy involves a comprehensive ecosystem of investments, from chip designers like Arm and Ampere to AI model creators like OpenAI, aiming to replicate his legendary early investment in Alibaba. This high-stakes bet follows a difficult period for SoftBank's Vision Fund, which suffered major losses. Despite past missteps where his vision was arguably too early, Son is now doubling down, convinced that AI is the fundamental technological shift that will define the future.

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship after a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, held his nerve to birdie the third extra hole for the win. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with the lead but finished one shot out of the playoff, tied for third. For Rose, the win was a gratifying return to form, proving he can still compete and win against the world's best players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to simplify the hiring process for newly qualified nurses and midwives in England's NHS. The changes aim to address a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies by cutting red tape and allowing hospital trusts to recruit staff based on anticipated needs, even before formal vacancies arise. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the goal is to support new graduates and help cut patient waiting lists. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the measures would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Trey Lance is making a strong case for the backup role on the Los Angeles Chargers, closing the gap with veteran Taylor Heinicke after another impressive preseason performance. In the Chargers' 27-13 victory over the New Orleans Saints, Lance demonstrated his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes. In contrast, Heinicke, who started the game, appeared rusty in his first action of the preseason. The game also highlighted strong showings from edge rusher Caleb Murphy and undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who recorded two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

          <h2>Mouse Study Suggests a Potential Link Between Nose-Picking and Alzheimer's Disease Risk</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a surprising and plausible link between nose-picking and an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that damaging the nasal tissue can create a direct pathway for certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, to travel up the olfactory nerve to the brain. In response to this bacterial presence, the mouse brains produced more amyloid-beta protein, the same protein that forms plaques found in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's. While the findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental triggers of this complex neurodegenerative disease.</p>
