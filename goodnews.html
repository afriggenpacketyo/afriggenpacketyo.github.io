The 89-minute event, scheduled for October 3-5, will be shown in all U.S. AMC locations and in up to 100 additional countries. Fans attending the event will see the premiere of a new music video, behind-the-scenes footage, and Swift's personal reflections on her songs.

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a stunning performance, defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns 34-19 to advance to the World Cup final. This victory ended New Zealand's 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament and marks Canada's first final appearance since 2014. The Canadian team, which had to crowdfund its journey to the tournament, dominated the match from the start, scoring three tries in the first 25 minutes.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a proposal Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected, stating that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and global security issues. The statement came as nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel, and the UK government continued its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and detail. The judge ruled that the filing violated federal rules requiring allegations to be simple and direct, citing its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail." Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a revised, shorter complaint with a 40-page limit. A spokesperson for Trump's team stated they would continue to pursue the lawsuit, while The New York Times reiterated its stance against what it calls intimidation tactics.</p>

          <h2>Trump and Xi Report Progress on TikTok Deal, but Final Agreement Remains Elusive</h2>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement was not reached during their recent phone call. While Trump expressed optimism, stating a deal is "well on its way," a readout from Chinese state media indicated differences remain. The proposed framework would see U.S. investors gain control of the app through a new entity that licenses TikTok's algorithm from its parent company, ByteDance. This structure aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a federal law requiring ByteDance to divest its U.S. business or face a ban.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has announced a policy to establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would enhance public confidence and make it easier for citizens to report crimes and interact with law enforcement. To fund the initiative, the Liberal Democrats propose abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, which they claim would free up over £100 million. The proposal aims to address public concerns about a lack of visible police presence following years of cuts to traditional police station front counters.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant has successfully recovered access to his bitcoin holdings after being locked out of his account for several years. Durant, who purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was significantly lower, had been unable to resolve the issue through the platform's standard recovery process. The high-profile case has drawn attention to ongoing customer service challenges at Coinbase, prompting Armstrong to state that the company is placing a major focus on improving its support systems. Durant is an investor in Coinbase and had previously joked about the situation, noting the lockout had inadvertently benefited him as bitcoin's value soared.</p>

Although Musk later denied the report, sources indicate the capital would be used to build out the extensive computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development, including a large data center in Memphis.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest point in two weeks, an unusual market reaction following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates. This upward trend in long-term yields suggests investors are weighing factors beyond immediate monetary policy, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. While the Fed's rate cut was intended to manage economic risks, positive labor market data has eased some concerns about a significant slowdown. Investors are now awaiting further inflation insights from upcoming economic data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

During a "Monday Night Football" broadcast, it was suggested that Kelly and Brady consult on game plans multiple times a week. Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource to discuss football concepts and strategies, particularly from Brady's extensive playing career, these conversations are not part of the official weekly preparation. The NFL has stated there are no policies prohibiting an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth during a game.</p>

          <p>On the Hawaiian island of Molokai, a community-led nonprofit, the Molokai Heritage Trust, is organizing an unprecedented effort to buy back over 55,000 acres of ancestral land. The property, known as Molokai Ranch, is currently owned by a Hong Kong-based investment firm and has been for sale for $260 million since 2017, sitting largely neglected. The trust aims to restore the land, which includes critical infrastructure like a water system, to ecological health and community stewardship, addressing issues of erosion and neglect that harm the local ecosystem. This ambitious initiative represents a significant move toward returning Hawaiian lands to Hawaiian hands.</p>
