          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions within three years. The teenager believes he might have been able to help save his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already succeeded in introducing training at his own school and has garnered the attention of Scotland's Education Secretary. He shared his moving story with Members of the Scottish Parliament to emphasize the urgency of equipping young people with confidence to act in an emergency.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has intensified his call for the implementation of a targeted national screening program for prostate cancer. Speaking as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argued that such a program is now affordable, deliverable, and would "save countless lives." The proposal focuses on higher-risk groups, including men with a family history of the disease and Black men. The call comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the risks of over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a complete version of the ancient Chinese calligraphy masterpiece, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The original work, created by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, had only survived in fragments, with just 250 of its 919 characters known. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving text, the team employed artificial intelligence to replicate the artist's unique style and generate the missing characters. This project showcases the potential of AI to preserve and reconstruct invaluable cultural heritage, bridging ancient art with modern digital technology.</p>

The IPO was oversubscribed more than 54 times, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion and marking it as the most heavily subscribed major Indian IPO since 2008. The strong demand was primarily driven by qualified institutional buyers, reflecting high investor confidence in the company. This successful listing highlights the continued strength of India's IPO market and the appeal of established consumer brands within the country's growing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new campaign in the UK will encourage people applying for a driving licence to also register as blood donors. The initiative, a partnership between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant, aims to boost donor numbers, particularly among young people. Officials hope to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the driving licence application since 1994. With over half of regular blood donors being over 45, the NHS faces a critical need for new, younger donors to maintain a safe and reliable supply for hospitals.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Mariners defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 10-3, securing a 2-0 lead in the American League Championship Series. The Blue Jays' offense, which had been potent against the Yankees, has struggled, managing only four runs and eight hits across the first two games. Star player Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is hitless in the series so far. Toronto now faces a significant challenge, as teams winning the first two games on the road in a best-of-seven series have historically gone on to win 24 out of 27 times. The series now shifts to Toronto for Game 3.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won the opening game of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers with a 2-1 score. Pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight scoreless innings while allowing only a single baserunner, whom he subsequently picked off. The decisive run came from a sixth-inning solo home run by first baseman Freddie Freeman. The victory came despite the Dodgers stranding 11 runners and overcoming a bizarre fourth-inning double play that cost them a potential grand slam, showcasing their ability to win with star power.</p>

          <p>A woman who struggled to speak after suffering a traumatic brain injury from a fall has found a new voice by learning British Sign Language (BSL). The 59-year-old former RAF navigator and lawyer says BSL has helped her relax and communicate when she cannot find the words. Her journey was featured in a BBC series where deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to residents of a retirement village. The experience has been transformative, not only helping her achieve a Level 1 BSL qualification but also giving her the confidence to communicate more freely.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations, though this marked a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softer performance in construction. In conjunction with the data release, the country's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, maintained its current policy settings. However, it issued a warning that GDP growth is likely to moderate to a near-trend pace in 2026 as global economic activity normalizes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has commenced mass production of a highly sensitive, four-channel single-photon detector, a critical component for next-generation quantum radar systems. This technology, capable of detecting the smallest unit of energy, is expected to significantly enhance China's ability to track stealth aircraft like the F-22. Described as a "photon catcher," the device's development by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui marks a major advancement. The technology has broad applications, ranging from national defense to secure quantum communications, positioning China at the forefront of this field.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte humorously commented on the state of Russia's naval fleet, referencing a Russian submarine that required towing in the North Sea. Rutte joked that the situation was more like "the hunt for the nearest mechanic" than a Tom Clancy novel, describing the vessel as "limping" home. Dutch authorities had reported the submarine was under tow, though Russia's Black Sea Fleet denied any malfunction, stating it surfaced to comply with navigation rules in the English Channel. The incident occurred as the Royal Navy was tracking the Kilo-class submarine during its transit.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed, successfully completed its eleventh test flight, launching from South Texas and traveling halfway around the globe. The mission involved deploying mock satellites and achieving a controlled entry for its booster into the Gulf of Mexico, while the main spacecraft descended into the Indian Ocean. This successful flight is a critical step for both Elon Musk's goal of reaching Mars and NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship to land astronauts on the moon. NASA's acting administrator praised the flight as a major advancement toward returning Americans to the lunar surface.</p>

The agreement, dubbed "The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity," outlines broad commitments to diplomacy and rebuilding efforts. The signing ceremony proceeded without Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office cited a Jewish holiday for his absence, though he had praised Trump's efforts earlier in Israel's parliament. This event marks a significant diplomatic step following the release of hostages and prisoners by both sides.</p>
