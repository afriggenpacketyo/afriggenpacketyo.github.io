Energy companies will pay out over ¬£70 million in response to a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Payments range from ¬£40 to ¬£1,000, depending on the mistreatment experienced, and will be paid directly into customer accounts. Ofgem suspended forced installations and implemented stricter conditions for prepayment meter installations without customer consent. (not investment advice)</p>

Filosa, a 25-year company veteran, will succeed Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December, and assume his new role on June 23. The appointment comes at a challenging time for Stellantis, which recently reported a decline in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. Filosa expressed honor in his new role, acknowledging the pivotal moment for the industry, while John Elkann will continue as executive chairman.</p>
