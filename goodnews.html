          <p>Joakim Medin, a Swedish journalist arrested in Turkey for 'insulting' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been released following diplomatic efforts. Medin was covering protests triggered by the arrest of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, when he was detained. He received an 11-month suspended sentence for insulting the president and faced additional terrorism charges, which he refuted. The Swedish Prime Minister thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European colleagues for their help in securing Medin's release. The Turkish government has continued its crackdown on the press amid ongoing demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A House amendment to the Republican budget package, which would allow the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah, is facing opposition from within the Republican party. Representative Ryan Zinke, former interior secretary, has voiced strong opposition, threatening the future of President Trump's budget bill. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to be exploited, which has drawn criticism from conservation advocates. The proposed sale has sparked debate over the value and management of America's public lands, with concerns about potential development and loss of valuable wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Fujirebio's blood test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in certain patients, marking a significant step in making diagnosis more accessible. The test measures proteins in the blood associated with amyloid plaques in the brain, a key indicator of Alzheimer's. It is intended for adults 55 and older presenting cognitive decline symptoms in specialized care settings. While other blood tests have been sold without FDA approval, this clearance provides stricter federal oversight and validation. The approval follows efforts to crack down on unregulated 'laboratory developed tests' and ensures more reliable results for patients at risk of Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>A military parade celebrating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday, could cost between $25 million and $45 million.

The event is part of the Army's anniversary celebrations on June 14, with costs shared by the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. The announcement has drawn criticism, with some calling it wasteful and self-aggrandizing, while supporters see it as a fitting tribute to the service and sacrifice of those who have served.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential lifting of US sanctions on Syria is creating both opportunities and risks for Lebanon. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun sees potential benefits in regional trade, refugee returns, and economic recovery, but some analysts worry Lebanon may be left behind if Syria reconciles with Gulf states first. Economic integration between the two countries could create a larger market and open land corridors for Lebanese goods. However, it remains unclear when or if sanctions will be lifted, and caution is advised against rushing the return of refugees to Syria.</p>

The legislation aims to prevent hiring officers with documented conduct issues, addressing a gap that allowed Sean Grayson, Massey's killer, to be hired despite concerns raised by previous employers.
