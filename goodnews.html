          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, announced a 50% increase in revenue for the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million, a significant jump from the $82.71 million reported in the same period last year. The company also achieved its first profitable quarter with a net income of $17.1 million, a stark contrast to the $26.5 million net loss from the previous year. Despite filing to go public in March, Hinge Health has not yet disclosed a price range, navigating a volatile economic climate influenced by President Trump's tariff policies. The company's software and wearable devices assist patients with musculoskeletal injuries and post-surgery rehabilitation, with costs covered by large employers.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is planning to introduce digital Social Security cards, aiming to provide a more secure alternative to traditional paper cards. Experts express cautious optimism, highlighting the potential for improved security and easier access to accounts. However, concerns are raised about accessibility for older or disabled individuals who may not be tech-savvy, as well as the need for robust protections against identity theft. Given the prevalence of data breaches, safeguarding both the Social Security numbers and the devices used to access them will be critical.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 17:51:48 EDT</div>

          <p>Medicare in 2025 will not cover several key healthcare costs, including routine dental and vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical services, and long-term custodial care. These exclusions can lead to significant out-of-pocket expenses for seniors, potentially straining retirement finances. As a result, many retirees are considering Medicare supplemental insurance, such as Medigap, to help cover these gaps. Purchasing supplemental coverage early is advisable, as healthcare costs are rising and eligibility can depend on one's health status. Medigap plans can also offer peace of mind with foreign emergency medical coverage.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., streamlining the approval process for pharmaceutical companies to establish production sites domestically. The order directs the FDA to expedite the approval of U.S. manufacturing plants by reducing unnecessary requirements and offering early support to drugmakers. This initiative comes ahead of potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, with the goal of reducing reliance on foreign drug supplies for national security reasons. The order also directs the EPA to accelerate the construction of facilities related to drug manufacturing.</p>
