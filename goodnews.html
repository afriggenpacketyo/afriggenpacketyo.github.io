        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries will be implemented in England's top two women's football tiers, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2, starting this season. This new requirement, described as a "full-time wage," is part of a broader effort by WSL Football to professionalize the sport and ensure players do not need to juggle part-time jobs. The salary thresholds will consider factors like age, league, and experience, developed in consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association. This move accompanies increased criteria for high-performance environments and welfare support, including a new partnership with Nike to provide equipment to players without endorsement deals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An optimistic outlook for the Los Angeles Rams suggests they are poised for a Super Bowl run, defying conservative win projections. The team's potential is bolstered by key offseason acquisitions, including receiver Davante Adams and center Coleman Shelton, who address weaknesses exposed in last season's narrow playoff loss to Philadelphia. The defense, which showed significant improvement late last season, is expected to continue its ascent with young stars and the addition of run-stopper Poona Ford. With quarterback Matthew Stafford's proven resilience and coach Sean McVay's leadership, combined with a relatively favorable schedule, the team is considered a strong contender in a weakened NFC.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to a prevailing narrative that single, child-free women are happiest, a new nationally representative survey indicates that married mothers report the highest levels of happiness. The study found 19% of married mothers describe themselves as "very happy," compared to smaller percentages of married women without children, unmarried mothers, and unmarried child-free women. This happiness is linked to a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life, which mothers reported at significantly higher rates than non-mothers. Additionally, married women reported less loneliness and more physical affection, a factor strongly correlated with happiness, challenging the negative messaging surrounding marriage and motherhood.</p>

          <p>Macy's reported second-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded Wall Street's expectations, prompting the department store to raise its full-year guidance for both earnings and sales. The company posted adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share against an anticipated 18 cents, with revenue also beating forecasts at $4.81 billion. CEO Tony Spring attributed the strong performance in part to revamped stores and stated the company is well-positioned to gain market share. This positive report marks a notable turnaround after the retailer had previously cut its annual forecast, citing uncertainty related to tariffs.</p>

          <h2>China's Summer Box Office Shows Signs of Recovery but Remains Below Pre-Pandemic Levels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 06:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's film market experienced a modest recovery during the summer season, with box office revenue reaching 11.96 billion yuan (US$5.5 billion), a slight increase of 2.76% year-on-year. However, this figure remains significantly lower than the record 20.62 billion yuan set in 2023 and falls short of pre-pandemic highs. Industry insiders note that while cinema construction has expanded, audience demand has not kept pace, making it difficult for many big-budget films to be profitable. In the first half of the year, only 23 films managed to surpass the 100 million yuan mark at the domestic box office.</p>

          <h2>California Plans $2.1 Billion Tunnel to Bypass Perilous Stretch of Highway 101</h2>

          <p>After decades of costly, temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has proposed a $2.1 billion tunnel to permanently fix a treacherous, landslide-prone section of Highway 101 known as Last Chance Grade. This three-mile stretch is the only viable route connecting the remote Del Norte County to the rest of the state, making it a critical economic and emergency lifeline. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel would be the longest highway tunnel in California, bypassing the eroding cliffs that have caused constant closures and claimed lives. While funding remains a major hurdle, officials argue the long-term solution is necessary to prevent the region's economic devastation.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's Fox News show, "Gutfeld!," has become the most-watched program in late-night television, attracting over 3 million nightly viewers with its irreverent and comedic take on current events. Airing earlier than its network competitors, the show has successfully captured an audience that feels alienated by the politically charged tone of mainstream late-night hosts. Gutfeld credits his success to recreating the unpredictable, panel-based humor of his earlier cult show, "Red Eye," but for a broader prime-time audience. He argues that other late-night shows created an opportunity for him by neglecting a large portion of the country and focusing on making viewers angry rather than entertaining them.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by herself over 80 years, is being shared publicly for the first time. Hurtado developed a signature uniform, typically a boxy, four-pocket shirt inspired by Japanese workwear, which she adapted with various fabrics and details throughout her life. Her journey into making her own clothes began out of necessity when she couldn't find maternity wear she liked, and it evolved into a core part of her daily practice of self-expression, alongside her painting and journaling. This collection reveals an artist who rejected convention and manifested her own reality, not just on the canvas but in every aspect of her life.</p>

          <p>Human bodies are not naturally equipped for long-duration spaceflight, presenting a major obstacle to ambitions of colonizing Mars. The emerging field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, which include heightened risks of osteoporosis, muscle loss, and radiation-induced cancers from existing in microgravity. As commercial space tourism increases, scientists will have more opportunities to study a wider range of health conditions in space, but significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding reproduction and mental health. Advances in this field, from AI-assisted diagnostics to creating organoid "avatars" for testing, are essential for ensuring human survival on interplanetary missions.</p>

          <p>As global water scarcity intensifies, desalination technology is becoming more critical, but its environmental impact, particularly the disposal of highly salty brine, remains a challenge. The dominant method, reverse osmosis, produces a chemical-laced brine that can harm marine ecosystems when discharged back into the ocean. However, new strategies are emerging to lessen these effects, such as improved dilution and dispersal techniques used at plants like the one in Carlsbad, California. Furthermore, innovative projects are exploring ways to treat brine as a resource by mining it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium, potentially turning a waste product into a valuable commodity.</p>
