        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans advanced a tax bill featuring trillions in tax breaks as part of Donald Trump's economic package, passing it through the House Ways and Means Committee. The bill includes raising the SALT deduction cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. The full House vote is anticipated soon, though the legislation may face significant alterations in the Senate, and House Ways and Means Republicans will continue to work closely with President Trump and House colleagues to get the One, Big, Beautiful Bill that delivers on the President's agenda to his desk as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have finalized a $96 billion agreement to supply Qatar Airways with up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X planes powered by GE engines. The White House has touted this as Boeing's "largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order," with the deal potentially supporting over a million domestic jobs. The agreement was formalized during President Donald Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The deal could significantly benefit Boeing, which has faced financial challenges in recent years, and nearly double Qatar Airways' existing fleet.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to remove fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing potential health risks. This decision coincides with growing legislative efforts to restrict fluoride use, including bans on adding it to public water supplies. Health Secretary Robert F.

The FDA will review the safety of fluoride products by October 31, despite concerns from dental experts about the lack of strong evidence supporting the move.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called on Iran to cease its nuclear program and end support for proxy groups in the region, stating he wants to "make a deal" with Iran.

Trump emphasized that Iran must halt its support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, warning of unfriendly consequences if Iran does not make the right decision. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright anticipates a deal with Iran by the end of the year, viewing it as a win-win scenario for both sides.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a freeze on new enrollment in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, for undocumented adult immigrants, effective no sooner than January 1, 2026. The proposal also includes a $100 monthly premium for Medi-Cal enrollees aged 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," starting January 1, 2027. These measures are attributed to economic slowdown and weakened state revenues due to Trump's tariff policies and higher-than-expected healthcare utilization. Newsom states he remains committed to healthcare needs for all Californians, but these steps are necessary for fiscal stability.</p>

It also eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, and allows car loan interest to be deducted. Some Democrats have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.</p>
