        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California state Sens. Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin are introducing legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during interactions with the public. The "No Secret Police Act" aims to ensure transparency and accountability, requiring officers to wear identifying information. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters, with clear riot gear permitted. The proposal follows protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration policies and seeks to prevent law enforcement from behaving like "secret police."</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee is navigating delicate compromises on Medicaid and taxes within President Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Chaired by Sen. Mike Crapo, the committee's legislation seeks to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, cut "Green New Deal" spending, and target waste and fraud in spending programs. The Senate aims to leave its imprint on the package, despite House Speaker Mike Johnson's plea for minimal changes, especially regarding SALT and Medicaid. The committee is balancing divisions over Medicaid provider payments and an increase to the SALT cap, a contentious issue for lawmakers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. The judge, Allison Burroughs, is considering arguments for a preliminary injunction, with Harvard's lawyers claiming the proclamation violates First Amendment rights and is retaliatory. The government argues it doesn't "trust" Harvard to monitor foreigners and raised concerns about "foreign entanglements" with China.

While paying in cash is the best option, experts suggest using credit cards with 0% introductory offers or personal lines of credit as wiser ways to borrow. Credit cards with 0% introductory offers can be beneficial if the debt is paid back within the introductory period. Personal lines of credit may offer lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments.
