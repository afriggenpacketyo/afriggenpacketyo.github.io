          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan aims to make progress in tariff negotiations with the United States but will not rush into a deal that compromises national interests. These remarks precede a potential meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. Japan's negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is set to continue talks with the U.S., emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. The imposition of higher U.S. tariffs on imported goods has raised concerns about the impact on Japan's export-driven economy, which also faces a reciprocal tariff rate of 24 percent.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move to ease tensions between the two nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the halt as part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. This decision follows the resumption of broadcasts last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons sent toward the South. While South Korea has called for civilian activists to stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border, prospects for renewed dialogue between the Koreas remain uncertain due to ongoing nuclear threats and North Korea's alignment with Russia.</p>

SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is behind TSMC in manufacturing capabilities, and access to advanced chipmaking equipment from ASML is limited by export controls, requiring China to pursue alternative technologies and lithography techniques.</p>
