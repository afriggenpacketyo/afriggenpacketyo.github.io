          <p>The White House announced that Canada has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected major U.S. technology firms. A spokesperson stated that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump after he threatened to raise tariffs and halt trade negotiations. The proposed 3% tax on Canadian revenue for companies like Google and Meta was intended to ensure large tech companies paid taxes on earnings from Canadians. The reversal is being framed by the White House as a significant win for American companies and workers.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations in California. The troops were originally deployed by the Trump administration to handle protests, a move contested by the state's governor. With an active wildfire season expected, state officials have expressed concern that the deployment has left firefighting forces understaffed. This potential shift would move 200 of the 4,000 deployed Guard members to help address the state's environmental crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed surprising growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, diverging from official government data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. This growth is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. The Caixin survey focuses on smaller, export-driven firms, providing a different perspective on the health of the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It does so by targeting and inhibiting a specific enzyme, revealing a key molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. These findings could lead to new strategies for promoting longevity by simulating the effects of exercise.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, younger investors are significantly influencing the stock market by rewarding bold, idea-driven companies over more established ones. He argues this generation favors companies with exciting, and sometimes speculative, concepts like Robinhood and Reddit, while punishing firms like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of bold innovation. This has created what he calls a "story-dominated market," where the potential of a company's vision is valued more highly than traditional financial metrics or Federal Reserve policies.

He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including forward-buying inventory by both Amazon and its third-party sellers to avoid the tariffs' immediate impact. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the Amazon marketplace helps keep prices down, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides a buffer for customers against the inflationary effects of the trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
