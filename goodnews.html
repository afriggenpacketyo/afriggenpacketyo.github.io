          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn announced a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing market expectations. The growth was primarily driven by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, with server product sales accounting for 41% of revenue, overtaking consumer electronics for the first time. The company, a key partner for Nvidia and the primary assembler of Apple's iPhones, projects its AI server business will continue to expand significantly. Foxconn is also diversifying into electric vehicles and semiconductors to sustain its growth momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move analysts suggest could have positive side effects for China-US cooperation on counterterrorism in Pakistan. The BLA has been responsible for numerous attacks in the region, often targeting Chinese nationals and interests. By adding the group to its FTO list, the Trump administration demonstrates a commitment to countering terrorism in the area. This action may help alleviate some of Beijing's security concerns and create an opportunity for collaborative efforts against regional terror threats.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) qualifications in the UK as students receive their 2025 results. It explains the difference between Level 2 BTEC Firsts (GCSE equivalent) and Level 3 BTEC Nationals (A-level equivalent), detailing the practical, project-based assessment style. The piece also covers the grading system and notes the popularity of subjects like health and social care. It further discusses recent government policy shifts, where plans to defund many BTECs in favor of new T-levels were paused, saving 157 key qualifications.</p>

It details how grade boundaries are determined by exam boards and outlines the procedure for appealing a result, which must be initiated through the student's school or college. For those who miss their required grades, the article describes the UCAS clearing system, which matches students to university courses with remaining vacancies. The piece also mentions alternatives such as resitting exams, pursuing apprenticeships, or taking a gap year for further consideration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 03:07:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of secondary sanctions, a foreign policy tool frequently employed by the United States to influence third-party nations. Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions target foreign entities that do business with a sanctioned state, such as Russia or Iran. Their power stems from the dominance of the US dollar and financial system, as foreign companies often comply to avoid losing access to American markets. However, their effectiveness is debated, as they can be circumvented through alternative currencies or intermediaries and risk alienating allies, pushing targeted nations closer together.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the origins of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution regarding what happens if a president becomes unable to serve. His mission to establish a clear protocol gained urgency in the years leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The amendment provides a crucial framework for ensuring a stable transfer of power during a presidential crisis, a topic of enduring relevance in American politics.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, creators of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The judgment affirmed that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp melody that is in the public domain, concluding the long-running legal dispute over the globally popular tune.</p>

Co-founder Daphna Langer believes this can save companies billions in fuel costs and significantly reduce emissions.

The motivations are twofold: it allows professionals to reclaim personal time and avoid loneliness, while also offering a budget-friendly way for loved ones to travel. While many employees do not broadcast these arrangements, companies are often quietly accepting of the practice, provided that business objectives are met and personal expenses are kept separate from company accounts.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll has revealed that the percentage of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with growing public concern about the health risks of drinking, even in moderation, particularly among younger adults. Experts suggest that increased awareness of alcohol's negative effects, combined with social trends like 'Dry January' and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives, is driving the shift. The poll also highlighted a gender divide, with alcohol consumption dropping more significantly among women than men.</p>
