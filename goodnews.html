          <h2>UK Newspaper Front Pages Focus on Winter Fuel Payment Reversal and Immigration Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with the expected reversal of winter fuel payment cuts, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves planning to restore the payment and then claw it back from wealthier pensioners through higher taxes. The Guardian reports potential chaos as tax officials may pursue bereaved families of deceased pensioners to recover the payments. The Daily Express highlights Farage's support for a full U-turn on the fuel payments. Other headlines include immigration policy differences between political figures and the possibility of net zero cuts being dropped. </p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school earlier in the year. The event was bittersweet, as students missed graduating at their traditional "Stadium by the Sea" location, but appreciated the opportunity to celebrate at the iconic venue. Speakers included Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal, who offered messages of resilience and hope to the graduating class. The school was offered the Bowl at a reduced rate, and the ceremony included traditional elements like student performances and speeches.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Study Reveals How Bird Feathers Helped Them Conquer the Skies</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were crucial for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in aerial dominance. Researchers analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period. The study, published in Science Bulletin, highlights the development of feathers that generated thrust and lift as an essential feature in the evolution of birds. While many feathered dinosaurs existed, most lacked the flight capabilities of modern birds.</p>

          <h2>Early Bacterial Exposure May Reduce Hospitalization Risk for Lung Infections</h2>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria infants encounter may protect them from dangerous infections, specifically reducing the risk of hospitalization for lung infections. A study found that babies colonized early by Bifidobacterium longum were significantly less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections. The research, conducted at University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. Researchers believe this early microbial exposure plays a crucial role in immune system development, potentially leading to new therapies for boosting beneficial bacteria in babies.</p>
