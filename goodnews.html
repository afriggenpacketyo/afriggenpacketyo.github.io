          <p>Six days after the death of author Dame Jilly Cooper, Queen Camilla shared an affectionate memory of her friend while opening the Cliveden Literary Festival. She recounted an anecdote where Dame Jilly humorously expressed her intention to get "absolutely plastered," bringing laughter to the audience. The Queen's tribute highlighted the author's mischievous spirit and love for a Vesper Martini, a drink also favored by James Bond. The event underscored the deep affection held for Dame Jilly, whose passing has prompted an outpouring of love for her contributions to literature and her vibrant personality.</p>

Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress," aiming to address the Anglophone crisis, combat youth unemployment, and unite the nation.

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Confront and Learn from Regret</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of regret as an unavoidable consequence of free will, suggesting that instead of avoiding it, individuals can use it as a tool for present-day self-discovery. Rather than dwelling on past mistakes with a "what if" mentality, engaging with feelings of disappointment or sadness can offer valuable lessons about oneself. The piece posits that embracing regret, even for a short time, can transform it from a painful reflection on the past into a constructive experience. This reframing allows people to learn from their choices and better understand their current values and desires.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour Party is in the process of selecting a new deputy leader, a contest between cabinet member Bridget Phillipson and recently sacked frontbencher Lucy Powell. While both are moderate politicians from the north of England, their campaigns represent a choice for the party's direction under Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Powell is positioning herself as a critical voice who will challenge the leadership from outside the cabinet, while Phillipson argues for influencing policy quietly from within to avoid destabilizing the government. With many party members reportedly disgruntled with Starmer's leadership, Powell is seen by many as the favorite to win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world is on track to produce a record amount of grain this year, highlighting a long-term trend of agricultural advancement that has made famines far less common than in the past. Innovations from the Green Revolution, such as high-yield seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and expanded irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since 1961, ensuring a global food surplus. However, challenges remain, as billions still cannot afford a healthy diet, and modern famines are now primarily caused by political failures, such as conflict and aid blockades, rather than crop failures. Climate change and trade restrictions also pose ongoing threats to global food security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, author Morgan Housel emphasizes that building wealth is a long-term endeavor that prioritizes consistency over speed. He advises that personal spending decisions should be guided by internal values, such as utility and personal happiness, rather than external benchmarks aimed at gaining social status. Housel suggests that true contentment comes from controlling one's wants and understanding that long-term financial success is achieved by earning average returns over an extended period. He cautions against the "fear of missing out," which can lead to risky, short-sighted financial choices.</p>
