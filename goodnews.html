        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United are significantly outperforming other major U.S. airlines, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong networks and a focus on premium travel, which better insulates them from challenges like falling domestic airfares and overcapacity in coach class. While the broader industry faces a difficult year with discounted summer fares, both carriers are leveraging international routes and lucrative loyalty programs to maintain their financial edge. They are also exploring further cabin segmentation to generate new revenue streams.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson has reportedly recovered from a recent shoulder soreness issue and is set to compete for the starting job at the upcoming training camp. Richardson, who missed most of last season with a shoulder injury, experienced a setback in June but is now cleared for participation. His return sets the stage for an open competition with veteran Daniel Jones, whom the Colts signed to a one-year contract. Richardson has shown promise with his mobility but has struggled with passing consistency in his career.</p>

          <p>Following a sharp 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, financial analysts are defending the company, with Jefferies upgrading it to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was prompted by a minor reduction in Abbott's growth outlook, a reaction analysts and the company's CEO have called "too punitive" and an "overreaction." They argue the headwind in the diagnostic business is temporary and that the company's strong fundamentals and potential for future growth make the current stock price an attractive entry point.

          <p>Undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk engaged in psychological tactics during the final weigh-in for his rematch against Daniel Dubois at Wembley. Usyk, who came in at a career-heavy 16st 3lb, repeatedly stepped in front of Dubois to flex for the crowd, appearing to unnerve his opponent. The tense face-off was the last encounter before their highly anticipated fight, a rematch of their 2023 bout which Usyk won via a ninth-round stoppage. Dubois is aiming to become the first British undisputed champion in the four-belt era.</p>

          <p>Chevron has officially completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets. Chevron's CEO stated the ruling affirms the standard industry practice that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers, clearing the path for the major energy sector consolidation.

          <p>The University of Michigan's latest Survey of Consumers indicates that public expectations for inflation have fallen to their lowest point since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped from 5% to 4.4%, and overall consumer sentiment edged higher. This suggests that consumers largely view the inflationary impact of tariffs as temporary and expect conditions to improve. These well-anchored expectations are an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve as it monitors the economy's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>
