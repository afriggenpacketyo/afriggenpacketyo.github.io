          <p>Morgan Stanley reports a surge in US investor interest in Chinese stocks, reaching a five-year high, with over 90% expressing a willingness to increase their exposure to China's market. The interest spans various sectors, including humanoid robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies, extending beyond US-listed Chinese equities to include the onshore market. This reversal of a multi-year trend is attributed to China's leadership in specific sectors, efforts to stabilize its economy and equity market, improved liquidity, and demand for diversification from US assets. While many investors paused investing in China, they are now reassessing individual stocks, suggesting a gradual but meaningful increase in capital inflows over time.

Violations date back to 2016, with one expert disqualified for "errors in the project review." The Rocket Force, established in 2015, oversees China's strategic nuclear missiles, and the review of military equipment procurement began after the downfall of former defense minister Li Shangfu in 2023.

          <p>Everton has undergone a significant transformation, avoiding relegation and investing heavily in new players after David Moyes' appointment as manager. The club's net spend of £97m on nine players is their highest ever, a turnaround from previous seasons marked by financial constraints and points deductions. This is attributed to improved financial management, the Friedkin Group's takeover, and strategic timing of signings after the Premier League's financial year end. Loan signing Jack Grealish and other new arrivals have bolstered the team's performance, and the move to the new Hill Dickinson Stadium is expected to increase revenue.

          <p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated that the league needs clear evidence that the Clippers circumvented the salary cap with an endorsement deal for Kawhi Leonard before taking action against owner Steve Ballmer. The investigation focuses on whether Ballmer's investment in Aspiration was a quid pro quo for the firm to give Leonard $28 million in cash and $20 million in stock. Silver emphasized the need for fundamental fairness and said he would hesitate to act if there was even a shred of doubt. The probe is being conducted by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, and concrete evidence of Ballmer's involvement is required. Optimism score is not directly reflected in this summary.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to "normal" levels, meaning that the share of income spent on mortgage payments is similar to what it was in 2018. This is due to a combination of slowing home-price growth and strong wage growth, particularly in tech-driven sectors. However, this does not mean that San Francisco is becoming affordable, and renters may not experience the same relief. The AI boom is reportedly spiking rents and crowding out lower-wage tenants.
