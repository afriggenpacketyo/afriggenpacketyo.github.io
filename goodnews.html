          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 17:43:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court extended its injunction, preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court cited inadequate time and information provided to migrants to contest their removals, emphasizing the importance of due process. The case has been remanded to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the appropriate process for these cases. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, while President Trump criticized the decision, and the ACLU praised the pause on deportations to what they called brutal foreign prisons. </p>

          <p>Eric Council Jr. from Alabama received a 14-month prison sentence for his involvement in the January 2024 hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's X account. Council executed a SIM swap attack to help conspirators gain control of the SEC's account, which was used to falsely tweet that Bitcoin ETFs had been approved, briefly inflating Bitcoin's price. Prosecutors requested a longer sentence, citing a video where Council diminished his culpability and blamed the SEC's cybersecurity practices. The SEC ironically approved rule changes allowing Bitcoin ETFs the next day.</p>

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation revealed that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged for items marked as being on sale due to price tag errors. The investigation found expired discount tags on numerous grocery items, resulting in an average overcharge of $1.70 per item, or 18.4%. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors are minimal compared to the billions of annual transactions, however, customers have filed complaints and class-action lawsuits alleging pricing errors at Kroger locations. The report also suggests potential staffing issues may contribute to the problem.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the significant drop in crime rates across the United States after a notable increase in 2020. Experts believe that 2024 may have set a record for the steepest fall in the murder rate, and 2025 is showing even more promising trends. The Real-Time Crime Index indicates that murder is down 21.6 percent, violent crime is down 11 percent, and property crime is down 13.8 percent through March. While the reasons for these changes are still being debated, the article emphasizes the importance of recognizing these trends to avoid demagoguery and misguided policies.</p>

          <p>The World Bank announced that Saudi Arabia and Qatar have paid off Syria's $15.5 million debt, which clears the way for Damascus to take out new loans.

The World Bank also mentioned that the first project in their reengagement with Syria is centered on access to electricity after an insurgency unseated former Syrian president Bashar Assad.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's appeal to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men accused of being gang members, a designation that the administration claims makes them eligible for rapid removal. The court's decision centers on the opportunity people must have to contest their removal from the United States, without determining whether Trump's invocation of the law was appropriate.</p>
