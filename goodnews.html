          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has stated that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling "completely out of his depth" when breaking bad news to patients. The experience with his stepfather made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he was not passionate about, ultimately leading to his successful career in entertainment.</p>

This shift contrasts with China's approach, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced open-source models, a strategy some experts believe could help China surpass the U.S. in the field. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng praised China's competitive open-source ecosystem, noting that while top proprietary models are American, the best open models are now increasingly from China.</p>

Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application interview. Her detention stemmed from a years-old, unknown deportation order, and her case highlights the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which has seen a significant increase in arrests compared to the previous administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died during its voyage from Australia to the UK. While long-rumored to have died from shock due to a German U-boat attack, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures rose well above the safe threshold for the species, indicating the animal, named Winston, likely succumbed to heat stress rather than enemy action.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense, carrying a potential five-year prison sentence, for individuals who advertise illegal Channel crossings online. The measure aims to crack down on people-smuggling gangs that use social media to promote services like fake passports or illegal work opportunities in the UK. This proposal comes as the number of migrants arriving via small boats has reached a record high for the year, with officials noting that around 80% of these migrants used social media during their journey.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start after a long stint on the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark, leading to a 4-0 Dodgers loss. Despite the result, Snell's effective pitching and command were promising signs for the Dodgers' rotation as they look toward the postseason.</p>
