          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and a history of complications, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Baker had been living with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for four years before developing dangerous heart rhythms and a high risk of organ rejection. Doctors decided to perform a combined heart-liver transplant to address the antibody issue, a procedure never before done on a patient with an LVAD. While the surgery was successful, Baker faces financial challenges due to medical bills and her husband's recent death.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, a move aimed at reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS), a version of Huawei‚Äôs open-source platform, was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat. The tests showed faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following this mission, China is proposing national technical standards to guide the use of OpenHarmony in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions.</p>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book explores his unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a truck driver and Joe Rogan fan. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, initially struggled to connect with Kappler due to their differing backgrounds and ideologies. However, they found common ground through surfing, which provided a neutral space for connection and understanding. Litt argues that shared activities can bridge political and cultural divides, even without changing minds.</p>

Meta recently invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and plans to hire former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. These moves aim to revamp Meta's AI organization, which is seen as lagging behind competitors. Zuckerberg faces pressure to improve Meta's AI models and technology, as its current open-source approach has not been well-received by developers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is urging the House of Lords to approve a bill that would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death, following its approval by MPs. Rantzen, who joined the assisted dying clinic Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes that the Lords should scrutinize the bill but not oppose it. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. The bill would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of less than six months to request an assisted death, subject to multiple safeguards.</p>
