          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate consumer burden due to soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores by June. The government intends to bypass auctions to control prices, and is exploring online sales in cooperation with Rakuten. This initiative aims to counter the recent record-high rice prices in supermarkets, which have doubled due to poor harvests and increased demand from tourism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1 as it approached the building, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. The loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which has since been moved. While the Army asserts there were no deviations from approved flight paths, the incident raised concerns about air traffic control coordination. The FAA declined to comment, and the NTSB expressed disappointment at the Army's handling of the information release.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a mega-project to construct a 767-kilometer-long canal connecting the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost $44.4 billion, is part of a larger effort to expand China's inland waterway network and lower logistical costs. The canal aims to connect Jiangxi's rare earth and copper reserves with Zhejiang's seaports, facilitating the transport of around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually. The Zhejiang provincial government plans to begin construction to make the province a leader in inland water transport by 2035.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats" after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic reiterated the EU's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial deal. European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. The EU is one of Washington's largest trading partners, with significant trade volumes.</p>

The band denied the offense, calling it "political policing" and "a carnival of distraction" away from Gaza. Fans showed strong support, with many wearing Irish and Palestinian flags and shirts. The band used their performance to express solidarity with Palestine and criticize authorities, despite facing cancellations of other gigs due to the controversy.</p>
