          <p>After years of studying parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework has been developed called emotionally safe parenting. This style focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as stress signals. This approach involves internal work, setting boundaries with empathy, preventing shame, and prioritizing communication.</p>
