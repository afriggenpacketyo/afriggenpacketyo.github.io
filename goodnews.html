          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order prevents the removal of Soliman's family, who are Egyptian citizens, pending a hearing on June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives is unlawful and violates democratic justice principles. The family entered the United States in August 2022 and were allowed to remain until February 2023, with Soliman applying for asylum in September 2022. </p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels to be deconstructed on the mainland. The agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. The cleanup is especially important to the Squaxin Island Tribe, as the island is of particular cultural significance to them. </p>

          <h2>Feather Fossil Study Reveals How Birds Surpassed Dinosaurs in Flight</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber sheds light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The detailed structural study of 99-million-year-old feathers provides insight into feather evolution during the Cretaceous period. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlight the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as a critical feature in bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly. </p>

          <p>A UK study suggests that the first bacteria infants encounter after birth could protect them from dangerous infections. Researchers found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in newborns halved the risk of hospitalization for lung infections within the first two years of life. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns. The findings suggest that early microbial colonization plays a crucial role in immune system development and could lead to therapies that boost beneficial bacteria in babies. </p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The ruling halts work on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. Sable Offshore Corp. must now push back its timeline for first sales to August 1, 2025, due to the delay. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, arguing that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review. </p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK's drug safety experts say it is not known whether taking these medicines could harm an unborn baby. The advice is already included in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women are not using the drugs safely. The UK drugs regulator, doctors, and pharmacists are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. </p>
