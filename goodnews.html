          <p>G7 leaders convened in Canada to discuss global trade, grappling with divisions arising from President Trump's tariffs and unilateral approaches. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation in a divided world, though Trump signaled disagreement with the group's consensus. Discussions encompassed strengthening supply chains for critical minerals and addressing regional affairs, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region where China's increasing military activity raises concerns. The summit concluded with "action-oriented" statements, reflecting the difficulty in achieving consensus on major global issues. Optimism among the leaders at the summit seemed muted given the divisions and the lack of a detailed joint statement.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix experienced a surge, reaching over two-decade highs, driven by reports of SK Group's plans to construct the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a prominent supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has benefited from the AI boom, with its shares increasing by almost 50% this year. While competitor Samsung has struggled to capitalize on AI-led demand, SK Hynix has emerged as a leader in high bandwidth memory, supplying to clients like Nvidia. The company's rise reflects the increasing importance of memory technology in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his highly anticipated pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani, who also serves as the team's leadoff hitter, pitched one inning in the game against the San Diego Padres, reaching 100 mph with his fastball. The Dodgers had initially planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani expressed his readiness to pitch sooner, leading to his expedited debut. The team intends to gradually increase Ohtani's workload, with plans for him to pitch as an opener once per week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports, driven by security concerns rather than solely profit. This shift aims to deepen ties and enhance interoperability between Japanese forces and allies. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, which is a key component of the concept of 'proactive contribution to peace.' The move also seeks to develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been struggling due to reliance on U.S. weapons imports, and improve economies of scale for domestic production.</p>

          <p>An untested Indian Test side, led by debutant captain Shubman Gill, is set to face England in a five-match series, marking the start of the fourth World Test Championship cycle. The series will test the team's adaptability and mental grit, especially for the batters. India faces a daunting challenge due to recent form, retirements, injuries, and fitness concerns, with key players like R Ashwin, Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli recently retiring. Bumrah's fitness is a major concern, as any interruptions to his bowling could disrupt India's balance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is warning that patients who film their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could be putting themselves and NHS staff at risk. The trade union's annual conference heard that more patients were videoing their procedures on mobile phones, often without asking permission. This could distract staff or make them feel uncomfortable and anxious, and sharing material on social media also risks publicising the private medical data of other people. The NHS needs policies to address this issue.</p>

The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The pact, initially agreed last month, is the first that the White House has announced since it imposed wide-ranging tariffs on various goods entering America earlier this year.
