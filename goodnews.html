          <p>Warrington Wolves triumphed over Leigh Leopards in a thrilling Challenge Cup semi-final match, securing their place in the final for the second consecutive year. Despite an early lead by Leigh, Warrington responded with tries from Rodrick Tai, Paul Vaughan, and Toby King, along with precise kicking from Marc Sneyd, giving them control of the game. Leigh fought back with two tries in the second half, but Sneyd's drop-goal ensured Warrington's victory in the sweltering conditions. Warrington will now face Hull Kingston Rovers in the final, seeking to improve on last year's loss to Wigan Warriors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family, intended for use as Air Force One until near the end of Trump's term, after which it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation. The arrangement is under legal review to ensure compliance with bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause, with legal analyses suggesting it is permissible if the gift is not tied to any official act. The Air Force would modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet military specifications before transferring it to the foundation, potentially raising ethical concerns about foreign influence and the use of public funds.</p>
