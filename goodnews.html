          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that sales for its popular weight loss drug, Wegovy, increased by 67% in the second quarter, reaching 19.53 billion Danish kroner. Despite this surge, the figure fell slightly short of analyst expectations, and the company's stock has seen declines since its peak. In response, Novo Nordisk has reiterated its full-year outlook but also pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus to improve performance and efficiency under its new leadership.</p>

The race pits Wilson's progressive, anti-establishment agenda against Harrell's more moderate, incumbent position, setting the stage for a competitive runoff election.</p>

          <p>China's initiative to manage high levels of local government debt has achieved a significant milestone, as Inner Mongolia is the first of 12 high-risk jurisdictions to be removed from a key watch list. The autonomous region's progress was confirmed in a local budget review, indicating success in its debt resolution efforts. This development is part of a broader campaign by Beijing to address the unsustainable financial models of local governments, which have been strained by declining revenue from land sales and other economic pressures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent decision by Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense challenges crossover athletes face in making the transition. Experts point to the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which is described as more difficult than studying law, as a primary obstacle. Additionally, the 'planet theory' suggests that for skill positions like running back, the pool of elite athletes is vast, requiring newcomers to be exceptionally superior to stand out, unlike linemen where unique size and athleticism are scarcer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by a booming domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy, China is actively strengthening its trade relationships with Africa's leading coffee-producing nations to secure new supply chains. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this push, signing agreements in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in local coffee industries and procure thousands of tons of beans annually. Analysts suggest this strategy allows China to 'lock in supply' by leveraging trade uncertainties elsewhere and catering to the rapidly expanding demand for coffee among its consumers.</p>

With the teammates closely matched in the title race, Brown acknowledges that tension will likely grow but believes the mutual respect and open communication within the team will prevent a destructive rivalry. He anticipates they might 'swap paint again' but is positive they will never deliberately run each other off the track, emphasizing the importance of their long-term relationship.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez was the star of the match, scoring twice to give Los Angeles FC a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the 2025 Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty and later secured the win with a skillful individual goal in the second half. The result leaves the Mexican club Tigres in a precarious position, with their chances of advancing to the next round now dependent on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Dodgers' lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead his team to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy, who had been sidelined with a knee injury since early July, provided a much-needed spark for the team's struggling offense. His performance was a key part of a strong offensive night for the Dodgers, which also saw Mookie Betts break a hitless streak and Teoscar Hernández hit two homers, signaling a potential turnaround for the lineup.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a declining statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security facility, which houses nearly 3,000 inmates, will see its population and staff transferred to other locations. The site, which originally opened as a luxury resort in the 1920s, will undergo a 'warm shutdown,' leaving its future open for potential reuse, with local officials hopeful for its restoration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As China develops its next five-year plan, economists are debating whether to include official, measurable targets for household consumption to bolster domestic demand. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a benchmark for the 'household consumption rate'—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a necessary national strategy to address its relatively low level. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning whether such a metric is operationally feasible to implement as a formal policy goal for the country. (not investment advice)</p>
