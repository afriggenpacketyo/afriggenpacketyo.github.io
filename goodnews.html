          <p>This opinion article supports New York City Mayor Eric Adams's policy to ban face masks in certain public areas, framing it as a necessary measure for public safety rather than an infringement on free speech. The author cites legal precedent, specifically the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik case, to argue that there is no constitutional right to anonymous protest. The piece contends the ban is a content-neutral regulation designed to prevent crime and hold lawbreakers accountable, thereby protecting all New Yorkers from individuals who exploit anonymity to cause harm.</p>

          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FLY." This move comes amid a recovering IPO market, following a downturn in 2022. The Texas-based company, known for its Alpha rockets and the Blue Ghost lunar lander, reported a significant revenue increase to $55.9 million as of March, although its net loss also grew. With a reported backlog of $1.1 billion, the IPO is being underwritten by major financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, following a temporary pause on some critical arms shipments last week. The halt had raised concerns in Kyiv, particularly regarding Patriot air defense systems needed to counter a surge in Russian aerial attacks. The renewed aid comes after a deal announced by U.S. President Donald Trump where NATO will purchase Patriot systems from the U.S. for distribution to Ukraine, with allies like Germany and Norway helping to fund the purchase.</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial services platform Robinhood surged to an all-time high, marking a more than 160% increase for the year, driven by a rally in cryptocurrency markets.

Robinhood is also confronting user backlash over a new 25% fee on staking rewards and public objections from OpenAI regarding its offering of tokenized, synthetic exposure to the private AI firm's stock.

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each successfully controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination between the platforms. This initiative is part of a broader strategic race with China to achieve air dominance through advanced, semi-autonomous systems. The tests represent a significant step in exploring how uncrewed aircraft can augment and support traditional fighters in combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of capital into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. The surge marks a significant rebound and has pushed Bitcoin to its best weekly gain since late April. (not investment advice)</p>
