        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Industry tracker IWSR projects that non-alcoholic beer will overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide by volume this year. While overall beer volume declined by 1% in 2024, non-alcoholic beer volume grew by 9%, driven by consumers reducing alcohol consumption and improved taste of zero-proof alternatives. Lager remains the largest beer category with 92% market share, though non-alcoholic beer sales surpassed $17 billion in 2023, with Germany, Spain, and Japan leading global markets. The U.S. ranks sixth in non-alcoholic beer sales, fueled by brands like Athletic Brewing, and celebrity endorsements are further boosting the trend.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings were strong, with sales growth hitting 69%, driven by demand for GPUs in data centers for AI software. However, U.S. export controls restricting the sale of its H20 chip are impacting sales in China, a $50 billion market. Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, and its latest Blackwell chips are designed for this increasing demand.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House to discuss economic growth, as invited by the president. Powell conveyed that the Fed's decisions would be grounded in "careful, objective, and nonpolitical analysis" and did not predetermine any future actions. He emphasized that monetary policy would support "maximum employment and stable prices," aligning with the Fed's dual mandate. The meeting occurred amidst tariff uncertainty, with a U.S. trade court ruling some of Trump's tariffs illegal, while the president has previously pressured Powell to lower interest rates.</p>
