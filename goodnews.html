          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the United States might extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate in good faith. Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, indicated the administration's willingness to prolong negotiations with countries actively seeking trade deals. Japan is one such partner, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with President Trump during an upcoming Group of Seven summit in Canada. The administration remains focused on securing trade deals with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union, but will unilaterally send out letters to less important countries to inform them of trade deals. This article discusses the potential extension of tariff pauses and the ongoing trade negotiations involving the United States and its key partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure to increase its military spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, emphasizing that reassessment by a new administration is standard practice. The Aukus pact, aimed at countering China's growing influence, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the US and the UK sharing cutting-edge technology. The review's outcome could impact the future of the trilateral security alliance.</p>

Qualification has already earned them $9.55 million, and any group-stage win will net a further $2 million. The tournament's addition to an already congested footballing calendar raises eyebrows, but it represents an invaluable opportunity for Urawa to compete with top sides.

          <p>Hong Kong aims to secure a leading position in global finance with the passage of a comprehensive stablecoin law. The legislation, effective August 1, seeks to address past industry setbacks and unlock value in the digital asset sector. Hong Kong's regulatory stance is friendlier than Singapore's framework, giving it a lead in Asia. Combined with its vast offshore yuan holdings and China‚Äôs restricted cryptocurrency use, the law raises hopes that Hong Kong could secure a prominent spot in the stablecoin market. The near-simultaneous legislative push with the United States underscores the intensifying East-West contest over financial influence in the digital era.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The two 86 million-year-old skeletons studied belonged to a species that is now the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. This discovery, published in Nature, offers insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved to become powerful predators in North America and Asia. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing about 750kg compared to an adult T.rex, which could weigh eight times that.</p>
