          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 01:59:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of people affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal. The scheme could cover 14 million agreements, with estimated average payouts of around £700 per claim, totaling a potential £8.2 billion from lenders. The scandal involves undisclosed commission arrangements, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information provided to consumers between 2007 and 2024. While consumer advocates welcome the long-overdue action, some legal experts and lending industry representatives have criticized the proposal, with the latter suggesting the scale of compensation is implausibly high.</p>

          <p>Everton's Jordan Pickford has solidified his position as England's undisputed number one goalkeeper, on the verge of breaking a record for consecutive clean sheets. Former players and pundits note his evolution, highlighting improved composure and consistency, which have silenced earlier criticisms about his temperament. While technically sound, his key strengths are identified as his remarkable reflexes and long-range distribution, which allows him to initiate counter-attacks effectively. Despite past links to other clubs, his commitment to Everton is seen as a factor in maintaining the stability that has made him indispensable for the national team.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 people, including hikers, guides, and support staff, have been safely rescued after being stranded by a severe weekend snowstorm on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The storm struck Saturday night, cutting off access to a camp at an altitude over 16,000 feet. Rescue teams provided food, medicine, and oxygen to those affected, some of whom were suffering from hypothermia. The incident occurred during a major national holiday week in China, a popular time for travel and trekking, and has led to the temporary closure of the scenic area.</p>

After falling behind early, the Yankees' offense ignited, highlighted by a game-tying, three-run home run from Aaron Judge in the fourth inning. A subsequent solo homer by Jazz Chisholm Jr. gave New York its first lead of the series. The team's bullpen successfully shut down the Blue Jays' offense to secure the victory and force a Game 4.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell discovered he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on a remote hiking trip in Montana, completely off the grid. He only learned of the prestigious award after his wife's phone received a flood of text messages upon briefly getting a signal. The Nobel committee had been unable to reach him for hours, marking one of their most difficult attempts to contact a laureate. Dr. Ramsdell, who won for his research on the immune system, eventually connected with officials 20 hours after the initial announcement.</p>

          <h2>New Kidney Transplant Method May Expand Organ Access by Converting Blood Types</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 00:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully tested a new method that could significantly increase the availability of kidneys for transplant by converting the blood type of donor organs. The technique uses enzymes to change kidneys to the universal O-type, potentially reducing wait times and improving allocation equality for patients from minority ethnic groups who often wait longer for a match. In a proof-of-concept study, a converted kidney was transplanted into a brain-dead recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This breakthrough offers a more immediate solution than animal-to-human transplants, which remain years from widespread practice.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Manager Explains Cautious Use of Star Reliever Roki Sasaki in Playoff Game</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts defended his decision to initially hold back relief pitcher Roki Sasaki from a save situation in Game 2 of the NLDS. Roberts explained he was trying to manage the workload of the rookie, who has been dominant since returning from injury but has little experience pitching on consecutive days. The initial plan nearly failed as another reliever gave up two runs, forcing Sasaki to enter the game anyway to secure the final out. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is the primary closing option but stressed that his usage will be carefully managed.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the author and illustrator of the bestselling book "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his new book was significantly delayed after his iPad was stolen. The device, which contained many drawings and ideas for the follow-up, was taken from his unlocked car and had not been backed up, forcing him to recreate much of the work from memory. Mackesy, who also dealt with the loss of his mother and his dog during the book's creation, described the theft as a setback that made him question his work but ultimately did not stop him.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, a former aide to Tennessee's governor, has won a crowded Republican primary for a vacant U.S. House seat after receiving a late endorsement from President Trump. Van Epps, a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel, will face Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the December general election. The seat, in a safely Republican district covering parts of Nashville and its suburbs, was vacated by former Rep. Mark Green. The race is seen as a test of Trump's influence and could offer insights into voter sentiment in suburban areas ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 200% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc from Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the controversial Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development in the state. The project aims to secure domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on China.</p>
