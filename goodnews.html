          <p>A 36-year-old California woman who became lost in a Michigan state forest while participating in a YouTube survival challenge was successfully located and rescued. The contestant was reported missing early Saturday morning after getting lost the previous evening in the Pigeon River State Forest. After an initial search with canines, a Michigan State Police helicopter crew spotted the woman using the aircraft's thermal imaging camera. Law enforcement and firefighters were then able to guide her safely out of the dense woods, bringing the search to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy for the upcoming World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying run, which has featured a lower percentage of long balls compared to previous tournaments, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial on the world stage. He acknowledged the limited training time available but emphasized that set-pieces like long throws will matter significantly during the tournament. The German manager plans to work on these strategic elements with his players during the remaining international breaks before the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Retired NFL defensive end J.J. Watt made his broadcast booth debut for CBS, drawing attention from fans for his new, longer hairstyle, a departure from his signature crew cut. Watt, who retired after the 2022 season, has since joined CBS Sports as an analyst and become a minority investor in the Burnley Football Club. He was on the call for the game between the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers, where his brother, T.J. Watt, plays.

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for the next Federal Reserve Chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must be 'fully independent of political influence.' Speaking on Sunday, Hassett highlighted that historical examples show political control over central banks often leads to inflation and economic hardship. His comments come amid ongoing pressure from President Trump on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates. Hassett also endorsed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's call for a widespread review of the Federal Reserve to address concerns about 'mission creep and institutional bloat.'

This victory marks her fourth Grand Slam title and highlights the lessons she learned from a painful loss in the French Open final earlier in the year. Sabalenka reflected that her previous mindset was flawed, expecting victories to come easily after reaching a final. Now, she has adopted a more humble and emotionally controlled approach, allowing her to navigate high-pressure moments and cement her status as one of the most consistent top players in tennis.</p>

          <p>British rock band Oasis delivered an emotionally charged performance at the Rose Bowl as part of their highly anticipated reunion tour. The concert was notable not just for the band's performance but for the powerful, cathartic reaction from the audience, with fans singing along to every song in a massive communal experience. The show, featuring brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher together on stage for the first time in over 15 years, has been compared to major cultural events like Taylor Swift's Eras tour for its ability to foster real-world connection. The focus was squarely on the classic songs, creating a shared ritual of purification for the tens of thousands in attendance.</p>

          <p>At the Italian Grand Prix, McLaren instructed driver Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place, creating a significant controversy in their intra-team title fight. Norris had been running ahead of Piastri for most of the race until a slow pit stop, caused by a team equipment fault, dropped him behind his teammate. Citing team principles of fairness and a similar situation in a previous race, McLaren ordered the positions to be reverted. While Piastri initially questioned the decision on the radio, he complied, and both drivers later publicly supported the team's commitment to its internal racing values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite advancements in aviation, most aircraft used for storm chasing and weather tracking, such as the NOAA's Hurricane Hunters, still rely on turboprop engines rather than jets. Turboprops are better suited for this work because they can fly slower and lower, maximizing the time spent inside a storm to gather crucial data. Their engines are also more efficient at these lower altitudes, and their ability to use shorter runways provides greater operational flexibility in remote areas. These advantages ensure that propeller-driven aircraft remain the gold standard for meteorological reconnaissance, especially as extreme weather events become more frequent.</p>
