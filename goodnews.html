          <p>SiriusXM is launching its first ad-supported subscription plan for in-car listening, a strategic shift for the traditionally commercial-free service. The new, cheaper tier, called SiriusXM Play, is designed to convert more customers who use the service during free trial periods and to better compete with other audio streaming options. This move mirrors strategies seen in video streaming, where ad-supported plans have successfully driven revenue and subscriber growth for companies like Netflix. The company aims to retain its core ad-free subscribers while capturing a more price-conscious audience.</p>

          <p>A review of Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," praises it as a deft exploration of memory, amnesia, and trauma. Though labeled a novel, the work is deeply autobiographical, chronicling a 16-year-old's relationship with a much older photographer in the 1980s. The article notes how Ullmann subverts genre conventions not by filling memory gaps with fiction, but by embracing them as central to the narrative. This approach challenges the idea that any autobiography can be a complete, factual record, suggesting all personal histories are shaped by what is forgotten.</p>
