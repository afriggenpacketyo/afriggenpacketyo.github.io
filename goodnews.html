          <p>Ford Motor Company announced a 16.3% rise in US sales for May 2025, driven by strong sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines and hybrids.  This increase comes despite a 25% drop in all-electric vehicle sales and price increases on some models imported from Mexico.  The company attributes the overall sales growth to its ongoing employee pricing program, introduced in response to President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles.  The positive sales figures show resilience in the face of economic challenges.</p>
