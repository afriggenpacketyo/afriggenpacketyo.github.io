          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "framework" deal for social media platform TikTok between U.S. and Chinese private parties, with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping scheduled to finalize terms on Friday. This significant development aims to pivot TikTok towards U.S.-controlled ownership, directly addressing long-standing national security concerns that had threatened to shut down the popular app in the country. The agreement follows months of intricate trade discussions and multiple deadline extensions for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business. This article highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts to navigate complex U.S.-China relations and secure the future of a platform deeply valued by young Americans, balancing economic interests with national security imperatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump proposed a significant change to corporate reporting, suggesting that companies should shift from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. He argued this adjustment would substantially save money for businesses and enable managers to concentrate more effectively on long-term company operations, drawing a comparison to China's perceived longer-term management perspectives. While current regulations mandate quarterly reports, the concept of less frequent reporting has garnered historical support from influential figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who advocated against quarterly guidance. However, critics express concerns that such a move could diminish transparency and reduce timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices soaring to near-record highs, exceeding $3,600 per ounce, financial experts are advising investors that the precious metal remains a worthwhile addition to portfolios. They anticipate further growth potential for gold, particularly with the highly likely prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts and the persistent threat of inflation. The ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar also positions gold as an attractive hedge against currency value erosion. Moreover, gold offers valuable portfolio diversification, as its performance typically remains independent of other asset classes. Accessible investment options, including fractional gold and gold IRAs, allow various investors to participate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares experienced a substantial surge of over 4% on Monday, propelling the tech giant into the exclusive $3 trillion market capitalization club, a tier previously occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple.

President Trump publicly congratulated Alphabet on this significant achievement. The article highlights the company's robust performance, with shares up over 30% this year, demonstrating resilience amidst ongoing regulatory scrutiny and fierce competition in the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector.

Battery life also poses a major hurdle, with robots like Agility's "Digit" offering limited operational time and requiring frequent recharges.

          <p>Career experts are strongly cautioning job seekers against making critical mistakes when using AI tools for creating resumes and cover letters, warning that excessive reliance can severely harm their job prospects. The article highlights that AI tools are prone to "hallucinating," or fabricating information, which can lead to the insertion of inaccurate details that become detrimental during interviews if candidates cannot authentically speak to their experience. Moreover, AI-generated content often lacks the unique voice and genuine impact that helps applicants stand out from hundreds of submissions. Experts recommend using AI primarily for polishing existing drafts rather than generating initial content, and stress the absolute necessity of thorough proofreading before submission.</p>
