          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan is monitoring the developments in the Middle East with "grave concern" after the United States attacked Iranian nuclear facilities. Ishiba underscored the importance of de-escalating the situation while stressing that Iran's nuclear development must be "blocked." Japan has traditionally maintained amicable ties with Iran, and stability in the Middle East is important for resource-scarce Japan. Another batch of evacuated Japanese nationals and their family members arrived in Azerbaijan from Iran, and Ishiba has instructed officials to closely monitor the situation and take necessary measures.</p>

          <h2>Self-Managed Medication Abortion Gains Acceptance and Faces Political Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medication abortion, involving pills rather than a medical procedure, now accounts for 63% of all abortions in the U.S., with self-managed medication abortion, obtaining pills without a prescription, gaining acceptance. Studies show it is safe and effective, challenging the need for mandatory ultrasounds and in-person follow-up appointments. The pandemic accelerated the shift, with the FDA easing regulations, allowing telehealth for medication abortion, although some states still restrict it. Despite medical acceptance, self-managed abortion faces political challenges, including states restricting access to mifepristone and lawsuits against telehealth providers.</p>

          <p>China is strengthening its economic and political ties with Central Asian countries, as evidenced by the second China-Central Asia Summit in Kazakhstan. The summit resulted in the signing of 58 agreements worth nearly US$25 billion between China and its regional partners. Kazakhstan also announced that China National Nuclear Corporation would lead a project aimed at building another nuclear power plant in the country. While China strengthens its position, the European Union and Russia are also seeking to expand their ties with the region.</p>

Research indicates that ‚Äúshielding‚Äù islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles.
