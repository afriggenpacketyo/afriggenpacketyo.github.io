          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei has enacted stricter immigration policies, requiring immigrants to reside in Argentina for two years or make a substantial investment to gain citizenship. The decree also mandates proof of income and clean criminal records for residency applicants. The government can now deport migrants more easily for illegal entry, document falsification, or minor offenses. Furthermore, foreigners will be charged for public healthcare and education, requiring all travelers to have health insurance, a move which has drawn criticism from left-leaning populists. \n</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic. The IMF anticipates a moderation in Denmark's economic growth from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, yet potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are not expected to significantly impact the country. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor pass through customs within Denmark, limiting the direct impact of U.S. trade policies. The Danish drugmakers rely on a merchanting and processing system that allows them to contract manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship the products. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling its release of stockpiled rice to stabilize rising prices, which have neared record highs. This action involves potentially releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice monthly for three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The decision follows a poor harvest in 2023 due to high temperatures and increased rice consumption from a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Independent Schools Council reports a 22.6% increase in private school fees following the introduction of VAT, surpassing government estimates. This rise is attributed to a combination of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief. The ISC anticipates a decline in private school enrollment due to the increased costs, with some parents already withdrawing their children. The government, however, maintains that the fee increases are not solely due to VAT. </p>
