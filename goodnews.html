          <p>Kristen Saban, the daughter of legendary college football coach Nick Saban, has publicly refuted rumors that her father might be considering a return to coaching. Speculation arose after a former player mentioned a potential comeback and Kristen posted a nostalgic photo, which some fans interpreted as a hint. However, she clarified on social media that her father is not coming back, stating that his time in coaching is over. The article notes Saban's previous comments on the changing landscape of college sports, particularly regarding NIL deals, as a factor in his retirement decision.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that a majority of high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more annually, also struggle with credit card debt, often due to lifestyle inflation. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for these earners, who typically have good credit scores and access to higher credit limits. The options discussed include using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates and leveraging 0% APR balance transfer cards. Other methods involve negotiating directly with creditors for better rates or consulting a financial advisor for a personalized payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency ether has seen a significant price increase, outperforming bitcoin as Congress passed the GENIUS Act, a major stablecoin bill now awaiting President Trump's signature. This legislation is being hailed as the first significant crypto-focused law in the United States, providing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins. On Thursday, ether-based ETFs saw higher daily inflows than bitcoin ETFs for the first time, signaling a potential shift in market leadership. Analysts note that ether's recent performance could indicate a trend reversal, as the new law is expected to embed stablecoins more deeply into the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wealthy American Express Cardholders Reduce Spending on Domestic Airfare</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Express reported that while overall spending by its affluent customer base remains strong, there has been a notable slowdown in one specific area: domestic economy airfare. Spending on airline tickets was flat compared to the previous year, contrasting with a 10% increase in premium cabin bookings and a 9% rise in high-cost hotel stays. The company's CFO attributed the weakness specifically to economy class domestic flights, a trend potentially influenced by declining airfare prices. This slowdown could be a concern for Amex, given its significant partnerships within the airline industry and network of airport lounges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after an international arbitration panel ruled in its favor against Exxon Mobil. The dispute centered on Exxon's claim to a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in a major offshore oil project in Guyana. The ruling clears the path for Chevron to gain a significant foothold in the prolific Stabroek Block, a key strategic goal for the company. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms standard industry practices regarding corporate-level mergers and acquisitions, while Exxon stated it respects the arbitration process despite disagreeing with the interpretation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings from placing $20,000 into either a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return, making them a safer bet in an uncertain rate environment. Calculations show that based on current rates, a money market account would yield slightly more interest over terms ranging from 18 months to five years. However, the article emphasizes that money market rates are subject to change, presenting a choice between potentially higher but uncertain returns and lower but guaranteed earnings.

          <h2>Analysts Maintain Positive Outlook on Texas Roadhouse Despite Rising Beef Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent dip in its stock price attributed to accelerating beef inflation, the long-term investment case for Texas Roadhouse remains strong, according to some analysts. Bank of America recently raised its price target for the steakhouse chain, citing expectations of continued market share gains and strong same-store sales. While rising beef prices, which jumped 15% year-over-year, pose a challenge to operating margins, the company's consistent customer traffic and expansion are seen as key strengths. The analysis suggests that while the commodity costs are a near-term headwind, the fundamental business trajectory is positive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and historian Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the centuries-old mystery of the two princes in the Tower of London. Contrary to the popular narrative that they were murdered by their uncle, Richard III, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting both princes survived. The research challenges the historical account largely shaped by the Tudor dynasty that succeeded Richard III. Langley argues that documents point to the elder prince, Edward V, living on under a different identity, shifting the burden of proof to those who maintain the murder theory.</p>

          <p>The annual royal swan survey on the River Thames, known as "swan upping," has revealed a hopeful recovery in the swan population. The five-day count found 115 young swans, a notable increase from 86 last year, suggesting a reversal of a recent decline. In the past two years, swan numbers had plummeted by 45% due to avian flu and acts of human cruelty. The tradition, which dates back to the 12th century, now focuses on conservation and education, with the King's swan marker expressing optimism that the worst of the avian flu impact may be over.</p>
