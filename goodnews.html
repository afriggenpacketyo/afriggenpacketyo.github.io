          <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 2.11% on Monday, nearing a four-year peak, driven by a tech rally and expectations of easing monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual speech in Jackson Hole signaled potential rate cuts, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining momentum and potentially attracting capital from the US to China. Chinese property stocks also rallied, with Shanghai easing home buying restrictions, despite some companies reporting widened net losses.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Premier League clash between Newcastle United and Liverpool is intensified by the ongoing transfer speculation surrounding Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, who reportedly desires a move to Liverpool. This match marks Newcastle's first home game of the season, with fans and coach Eddie Howe aiming to channel the crowd's energy despite the distraction. The transfer saga follows Liverpool's earlier acquisition of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle had pursued for years, adding another layer of rivalry. Newcastle faces a race against time to secure new strikers if Isak departs, further complicating the team's preparations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate cooled to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021, driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, below economists' forecasts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to address weaker growth and rising trade tensions, forecasting economic moderation in the second half of 2025.</p>

The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This privatization decision aligns with China's State Council efforts to consolidate state-owned carmakers and enhance competitiveness in the sector. Despite a nearly 15% drop in total vehicle deliveries, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models surged by 33% in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months. This move comes as expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts intensified after Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference. Powell's comments signaled a potential interest rate cut in September, causing the US dollar index to fall to a four-week low. The offshore yuan also climbed, reflecting market confidence that a September Fed rate cut is almost certain, with focus now shifting to the scale and pace of future easing.</p>

          <p>New Mexico lawmakers are evaluating a high-tech solution to address the state's alarmingly high rate of uninsured motorists, which stands at approximately one-third of its driving population. The proposed "Automated Nationwide Non-Invasive Enforcement" (ANNIE) program utilizes license plate readers to check a real-time insurance database, allowing law enforcement to issue notices of violation. Drivers could then pay a fine or enter a diversion program, committing to maintain insurance. Proponents argue this system would hold drivers accountable and free up police resources, though some legislators debate the necessity of a new state law for its implementation.</p>

This shift, also pursued by industry giants like Amadeus and Sabre, aims to offer a more personalized and flexible booking process, allowing airlines to compete more effectively with online travel agents by selling hotels, car rentals, and other services directly. Riyadh Air is set to be the first 'digitally native' airline, launching without legacy Passenger Service System (PSS) technology.</p>
