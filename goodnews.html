          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson is embracing a new phase in his career by taking on the demanding, dramatic role of mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." In a recent interview, Johnson revealed that he was nervous about the role but felt a deep need to tackle a character that allowed him to explore raw, complex emotions, drawing on his own past trauma of being evicted as a teenager. He explained that after years of chasing box office success with blockbuster films, he sought greater personal fulfillment as an actor. This shift represents what he calls a "whole new book" in his career, moving beyond his established action-hero persona.</p>

          <p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl offers a commentary on the holiday's central theme of "Teshuvah," which translates to "return." She explains that this period is not just about individual resolutions but about communal atonement, where people collectively take responsibility for societal shortcomings like spreading hate or ignoring the vulnerable. Rabbi Buchdahl, the first Asian American to be ordained as a rabbi, extends this concept to the United States, suggesting the nation could benefit from a collective return to its better self. She frames this process as fundamentally hopeful, emphasizing the joy in knowing that both people and societies have the capacity for positive change and renewal.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated and historic diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The leaders of all three nations framed the decision as a necessary step to revive the two-state solution and build momentum for lasting peace, explicitly stating it is not a reward for Hamas but rather a move that excludes the terror group from any future role. This watershed moment, which follows a similar announcement by France, places these key Western allies at odds with the United States and Israel. The recognition is largely symbolic but carries significant weight, especially from the U.K., given its historical role in the region.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Identifies Nine Parental Practices That Foster Strong Social Skills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:23:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article outlines nine key practices, emphasizing that true social learning comes from an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection, rather than just memorizing polite phrases. These practices include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, fostering genuine confidence through trust and encouragement, and teaching children how to repair relationships after conflict. The core idea is that children learn to communicate and connect effectively by observing and internalizing their parents' emotionally intelligent behaviors.</p>

          <p>The USA has once again asserted its dominance at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, finishing atop the medal table with 26 total medals, including 16 golds. This continues a trend of American supremacy in the sport, with Kenya and Jamaica finishing second and third respectively in the overall medal count. In stark contrast, the event was a major disappointment for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which failed to win a single gold medal for the first time since 2003. The British team's performance, ending 21st in the table, marks its worst finish in over two decades and stands in sharp contrast to its strong showings at recent championships and the Olympics.</p>

          <p>Italy has successfully defended its Billie Jean King Cup title, defeating the United States 2-0 in the final held in Shenzhen. The Italian team clinched their sixth championship in the premier women's team tennis competition through decisive singles victories by Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini. Paolini's win over Jessica Pegula was particularly notable, as it was her first victory against the American in six attempts. This triumph makes Italy the first nation to win back-to-back titles since the Czech Republic's three-year streak from 2014-2016, highlighting a golden era for Italian tennis across both men's and women's competitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards continue to rise, a credit expert from The Points Guy, Brian Kelly, advises consumers on how to get the most value from their rewards cards. He argues against automatically choosing no-fee cards, as their rewards are often minimal, and suggests that even a modest annual fee can be worthwhile for the enhanced perks. Other key mistakes to avoid include hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to periodically reassess if a card still aligns with one's changing lifestyle and spending habits. Kelly also recommends calling the credit card company to negotiate or ask for retention offers before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

Piastri's main rival and teammate, Lando Norris, was unable to fully capitalize on the mistake, finishing seventh after getting stuck in traffic and a slow pit stop. While Piastri's championship lead was reduced, the costly weekend for McLaren was somewhat mitigated by Norris's inability to gain significant ground.</p>

Currently, only about 20% of the seabed has been surveyed with modern sonar, leaving vast underwater landscapes less understood than the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. Environmental journalist Laura Trethewey explains that while the technology exists, the project is hampered by high costs, a lack of political will, and growing geopolitical tensions that make nations hesitant to share sensitive mapping data. While a complete map could unlock scientific discoveries and insights into climate change, it also raises concerns about accelerating deep-sea mining and resource exploitation.</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement that analysts argue demonstrates the ineffectiveness of U.S. efforts to stifle its technological growth. Instead of hindering China, American policies like export controls and blacklisting have spurred massive domestic investment in research and development, accelerating the nation's push for self-sufficiency. In 2024, China's R&D spending exceeded 3.6 trillion yuan, making it the world's second-largest spender in the field. This development suggests that the U.S. strategy of tech decoupling may be backfiring, inadvertently strengthening its rival's innovation capabilities while potentially harming global collaboration.

These multiple microphones work together to provide a range of audio capabilities, such as enhancing call quality through noise cancellation, which isolates your voice from background sounds. They also enable more immersive audio capture when recording videos and improve the accuracy of voice assistants like Siri by providing better sound reception from multiple directions.</p>

The new Northeast Public Health Collaborative, comprising seven states and New York City, aims to create unified guidance on issues such as vaccine purchasing and emergency preparedness. This trend, also seen with the West Coast Health Alliance, reflects a shift where states are increasingly taking the lead on health recommendations, creating a potential patchwork of policies across the country. Experts warn that while these alliances can strengthen regional responses, the fracturing of national guidance could exacerbate health disparities, as infectious diseases do not respect state borders.</p>
