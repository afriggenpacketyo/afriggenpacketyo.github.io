          <p>The first group of critically ill and injured Palestinian children has been successfully evacuated from Gaza, en route to the UK for essential NHS medical treatment. This humanitarian initiative, coordinated by various UK government departments, was confirmed by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. The group is understood to comprise 30 to 50 children, with provisions for family accompaniment, following extensive diplomatic efforts to facilitate their departure. This development unfolds against a backdrop of severe strain on Gaza's health infrastructure, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting numerous deaths from starvation and malnutrition, underscoring the urgent need for such medical aid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, a landmark measure to phase out PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, and various other household items. This move, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, aims to address significant public health and environmental concerns linked to these persistent chemicals. The legislation has sparked debate, with environmental groups and advocates like Mark Ruffalo supporting the ban, while some celebrity chefs and the cookware industry argue that certain PFAS, like PTFE (Teflon), are safe when used correctly. The bill sets compliance deadlines between 2028 and 2031, encouraging a shift to PFAS-free alternatives.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has developed Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, a new generation of foundation AI models that demonstrates remarkable efficiency, matching the performance of larger predecessors while being significantly smaller and more cost-effective. Developers report the model performs up to ten times faster in some tasks than its April-released predecessor, Qwen3-32B, with a 90% reduction in training costs. Industry experts, like Stability AI co-founder Emad Mostaque, lauded its performance relative to its low estimated training cost of under $500,000, contrasting sharply with Google's Gemini Ultra which cost an estimated $191 million to train. This innovation positions Alibaba at the forefront of AI development.</p>

This three-year program, led by the FAA, aims to establish new regulatory frameworks and forge partnerships with private companies and local governments. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that this initiative will cement America's leadership in aviation innovation, fostering high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunities. The program will involve at least five pilot projects, testing both piloted and unmanned operations for cargo, supplies, and emergency services, potentially allowing pre-certification flights to accelerate market entry.</p>

Key projects include a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline and new port terminals, designed to transport natural gas liquids and other cargo without relying on the canal's water. Additionally, the Rio Indo dam and tunnel project, costing $1.6 billion, will supplement Lake Gatun's water supply, crucial for the canal's locks. These initiatives aim to enhance reliability and attract more traffic, though some villagers face relocation, and completion is not expected before the next El Niño in 2027.</p>

          <p>The long throw, a tactical weapon once famously employed by Rory Delap, is making a resurgence in Premier League football, with Brentford emerging as its masters. The article highlights Brentford's effectiveness, scoring seven goals from long throws since last season, significantly more than any other team. Coach Keith Andrews, a former defensive midfielder who faced Delap's throws, embraces the tactic despite perceived "snobbery" in the game. Pundits and coaches acknowledge its difficulty to defend, as it creates chaos in the box from unusual angles. This demonstrates how a seemingly old-school approach can still be a valuable tool for gaining advantages and scoring goals.</p>

          <p>Robert Andrews Jr., a Newport father who maintained a modest facade, was unmasked as the mastermind of a multi-million pound drug empire after incriminating WhatsApp messages were discovered on another gang leader's phone. Covert police surveillance, codenamed Operation Mayland, captured Andrews Jr conducting brazen Class A drug deals and exchanging large sums of cash, sometimes using unique bank note serial numbers as "tokens" for authentication. The investigation revealed he made £650,000 in payments to suppliers in just two weeks, funnelling illicit wealth into an unfinished luxury home. Andrews Jr. was sentenced to 14 years and eight months, alongside other significant members of his organized crime group.</p>
