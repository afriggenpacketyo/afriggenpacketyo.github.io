          <p>This New York Times article examines President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizure policies, highlighting his false accusations of mass killings of white South Africans and land confiscation without payment. The article contrasts Trump's stance with his own administration's use of eminent domain to seize land for the border wall in Texas. It recounts how farmers were compelled to give up their land despite their opposition, illustrating the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of government land acquisition policies. The article underscores the importance of understanding the nuances of eminent domain and its impact on landowners, both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House, pushing false claims of "genocide" against white South African farmers.

          <p>Warren Buffett, during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, stated his preference for stocks over real estate for long-term investment.

He supported his argument by pointing out that the S&P 500 has outperformed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index over the past four decades. (not investment advice)</p>
