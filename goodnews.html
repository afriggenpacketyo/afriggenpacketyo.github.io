        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals, amidst ongoing bilateral tariff discussions. This acknowledgment suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade negotiations, contrasting with President Trump's previous concerns about Japan devaluing the yen to gain a trade advantage. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, while Japan continues to oppose additional tariffs. Japan is also reportedly considering concessions on tariff rates to expedite a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains traction, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has identified emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, noting improved U.S.-China trade relations and attractive valuations. A decline in confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasurys, equities, and the dollar, has further bolstered the appeal of emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are calling on the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, for their baggage fees, accusing them of misleading passengers and causing confusion at check-ins. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) argues that additional charges for hand baggage that do not meet airline guidelines breach EU consumer law. Passengers can pay up to ‚Ç¨280 extra to take on a suitcase, according to the consumer groups. Ryanair and Norwegian say their rules comply with EU law, while other airlines claim that the action would decrease consumer choice.</p>

          <p>Despite claims from some, many Afrikaners are denying the existence of a "white genocide" in South Africa, with one commentator stating that Whites are economically the strongest group in the country. Nick Serfontein, an Afrikaner cattle farmer, says he feels safe and sleeps with his doors open on his farm. He is involved in a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land, with a goal of land being shared by both Black and White. These statements contrast with the Trump administration's decision to welcome Afrikaners as refugees.</p>
