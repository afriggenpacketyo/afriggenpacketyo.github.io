          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has clarified recent comments he made, denying that his distinction between "entertainers and competitors" was a jab at his rookie teammate, Shedeur Sanders. During a preseason game, Gabriel stated his job was to compete, which led to social media speculation that he was referencing the highly publicized Sanders. Gabriel later explained the "entertainers" he referred to were the media, while he and his teammates are the competitors focused on their jobs. Both quarterbacks are currently competing for the starting position on the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent online discussion highlights a growing sentiment among millennials and Gen Z that Bitcoin and other digital assets represent their generation's primary wealth-building opportunity, akin to how affordable housing was for Baby Boomers. With the median home price having vastly outpaced income growth over the decades, many younger people feel priced out of the traditional real estate market. Proponents argue that Bitcoin offers advantages like global accessibility, liquidity, and no maintenance costs, positioning it as a form of "digital real estate." Critics, however, point to the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility and lack of physical utility as significant risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents the case for purchasing Bitcoin, highlighting its fixed supply cap of 21 million units as its most compelling feature. It contrasts this scarcity with the ever-expanding money supply and national debt of countries like the United States, suggesting that ongoing currency debasement will inherently drive up the value of a finite asset. The argument posits that as more fiat currency is created to manage economic crises and stimulus, the price of Bitcoin is positioned for long-term appreciation. The pre-determined "halving" schedule, which slows the creation of new coins, further reinforces this supply-side dynamic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant concession during his summit with President Trump, agreeing to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. Witkoff described this development as "game-changing," as it addresses one of Ukraine's core security demands and a primary reason for its desire to join NATO. This potential breakthrough comes as part of discussions for a broader peace agreement, though many details of how such a guarantee would function remain unspecified. European and Ukrainian leaders have cautiously welcomed the news.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Goal Disallowed Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Defensive Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal scored by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed following a VAR review due to a lesser-known rule infringement. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the Chelsea defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to the International Football Association Board's Law 13, which was introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall formed by three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>
