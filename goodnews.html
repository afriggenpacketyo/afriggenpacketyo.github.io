          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are remembering Giorgio Armani not just for his revolutionary designs but also for his visionary business strategy that built a global empire. He is credited with popularizing the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women, fundamentally changing office attire and tapping into the cultural zeitgeist. By strategically using celebrity endorsements and maintaining full ownership of his brand, Armani ensured a consistent, sophisticated vision across a diverse portfolio that expanded from luxury apparel to home goods and cosmetics.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows, a new analysis reveals significant state-by-state disparities in lottery spending, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a difference partially attributed to accessibility in urban versus rural areas. The report also highlights the financial importance of lotteries for state budgets, accounting for an average of 1% of general revenue and reaching as high as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling that prevents the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million individuals from Haiti and Venezuela. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security's actions to end the protections were an overstep of its authority and were arbitrary. This decision provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and Haitians, allowing them to legally live and work in the United States while their home countries are deemed unsafe for return.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit from authors who accused the firm of using pirated books to train its chatbot, Claude. The settlement, one of the largest copyright recoveries ever, could set a major precedent for how AI companies source their training data. A judge had previously ruled that while training on copyrighted material was not illegal, Anthropic had wrongfully acquired millions of books from pirate websites, creating significant legal and financial risk for the company.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett discussed a recent, sharply worded opinion in which she directly criticized a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Barrett explained that she felt Jackson's "spirited argument" on the issue of nationwide injunctions warranted an equally "spirited response" in return. She emphasized that such vigorous debates are confined to legal ideas and do not affect the personal collegiality and respect she shares with her fellow justices, including Justice Jackson.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, has announced it will pause its 2026 target requiring 20% of new car sales to be electric vehicles, though long-term goals remain. This move is part of a broader strategy to bolster the nation's economy, which includes a new "Buy Canadian" policy for federal contracts. The policy shifts are a direct response to economic pressures, including significant job losses in August and the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on key Canadian industries like auto and steel.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their collective market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. The surge was led by Alphabet and Apple, which rallied after a federal judge's antitrust ruling imposed limited penalties on Google, removing a significant market overhang for both firms. This decision allows their lucrative search engine partnership to continue and opens the door for deeper collaboration on artificial intelligence, further cementing the dominance of megacap tech stocks in the S&P 500.

The sharp decline breaks a months-long trend of rates hovering in a higher range, though it remains to be seen if this will be enough to reinvigorate housing market demand.

The reshuffle recasts the top level of his government as he seeks to focus on delivery and confront a resurgent Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>A UK employment tribunal has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for spending time on personal websites like Amazon and Rightmove during work hours. The judge determined that her browsing, which amounted to less than an hour over two days, was not "excessive" and that the company had no clear policy against such activity. The employee was awarded over £14,000 after the judge concluded the employer's true motive was likely to replace her before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger legal protections.</p>
