          <h2>Declassified Memo Undermines Trump's Rationale for Deporting Venezuelans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts claims made by President Trump to justify using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, states that intelligence agencies do not believe that Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro controls the criminal gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump had asserted. The release of the memo further weakens the administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and raises questions about its criticism of press coverage that reported the intelligence community's findings. The Justice Department had previously opened a criminal leak investigation after The New York Times published its article on the intelligence community's conclusions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal judge in Texas to dismiss a case aiming to restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone, continuing the Biden administration's position that Texas is not the proper venue for the lawsuit. The Justice Department argues that Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas have no ties to Texas and therefore lack standing in the suit against the Food and Drug Administration. The three Republican-led states are challenging FDA actions that loosened restrictions on the drug in 2016 and 2021. The Trump administration also argued that the states' challenge to FDA‚Äôs 2016 actions is outside the six-year statute of limitations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, resulting in a likely victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers agreed that removing ballots six months after Election Day would violate the U.S. Constitution. Myers ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. The judge delayed his decision for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced he will retire at the end of the year as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of a six-decade era of investing and corporate leadership. Buffett's performance was a thousand times that of the blue-chip American index, making him the best investor ever. He stood out on Wall Street for his focus on the long term and his fealty to shareholders. His successor will be Gregory Abel. Buffett's efforts to prop up the U.S. financial system during the 2008 crisis have made him irreplaceable.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing the nonprofit that controls OpenAI to retain its grip on the company. This decision follows criticism that the company was too focused on profits and had abandoned its mission to prioritize safety. The attorneys general in California and Delaware were monitoring its restructuring, and experts like Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about OpenAI's direction. This new structure allows the nonprofit to be OpenAI's largest shareholder, which may affect Elon Musk‚Äôs lawsuit against the company.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, one of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos created using artificial intelligence. The shutdown comes days after Congress passed the "Take It Down Act," which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. Experts say that while the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will not go away, disbanding the largest archive of deepfake porn is a step in the right direction.</p>

While some recognize the benefits of AI for specific purposes, they worry about its wider implications. Others, however, have had to adopt AI in their work due to budget cuts and industry demands. Philosophy professor James Brusseau believes the moment to opt out of AI has already passed, with humans needed for decisions requiring empathy and judgment.</p>
