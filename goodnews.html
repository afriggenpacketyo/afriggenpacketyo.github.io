          <h2>Millions of Bees Escape After Truck Overturns in Washington State</h2>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees, but corrected the figure following assistance from a beekeeper. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow beekeepers to assist with re-hiving the bees and finding their queen. The public was advised to avoid the area, but authorities stated there was no general health risk except for those allergic to bee stings, and by the next morning, most bees had returned to their hives. The quick response and the bees' natural instincts improved the situation considerably.</p>

          <p>During the 2025 Memorial Tournament Pro-Am, NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning's wayward tee shot reportedly hit a house, prompting laughter from his partner, PGA champion Scottie Scheffler. Video footage captured Manning yelling "Fore!" before the sound of impact, followed by Scheffler's amusement and lighthearted comment. Eli Manning, Peyton's brother, shared the video on social media, adding to the humor. Scheffler, the defending champion, was competing in the tournament and entered the third round in fourth place. The overall tone of the event was lighthearted and humorous, and it's likely the homeowner took it in stride.</p>

          <h2>The Annoying Prevalence of Corporate Buzzwords in Workplace Communication</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, especially Gen Zers who rely on instant answers. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. While buzzwords are intended to convey meaning, they often serve as distractions from the primary goal of making money. The author suggests using real, human language instead of relying on metaphors and jargon. The article offers a humorous take on a common workplace frustration.</p>
