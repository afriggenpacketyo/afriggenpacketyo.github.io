          <p>In a significant departure from his previous stance, President Trump stated that he believes Ukraine is now in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media that Russia's military appears weak, like a "paper tiger," and is facing major economic trouble. This marks a reversal from his prior suggestions that Ukraine should consider ceding land to end the more than three-year-long war, now urging that it is time for Ukraine to act.</p>

          <p>Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin, is reportedly seeking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in a private placement. This new funding round could value the cryptocurrency firm at approximately $500 billion, placing it on par with major private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The move comes as Tether aims to re-establish its presence in the U.S. market, encouraged by the current administration's pro-crypto stance and the recent launch of a new regulated token for American businesses.

The company's overall revenue saw a 46% year-over-year increase, with sales of memory for cloud providers more than tripling. This strong performance is largely attributed to the high demand for high-bandwidth memory, a critical component for AI chips like those made by Nvidia, positioning Micron as a key beneficiary of the technology trend.

          <p>Actor Marlon Wayans has taken to social media to defend his new film, "HIM," which has received largely negative reviews from critics, holding a 29% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Wayans encouraged his followers to form their own opinions, pointing out that many of his past films, like "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie," were also poorly reviewed but went on to become cult classics. He argued that art is subjective and some innovative movies are ahead of their time, asking fans to see the film before accepting the critical consensus.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced that the city has avoided laying off any municipal workers this year, resolving a budget crisis that once threatened over 1,600 jobs. The solution was achieved through months of negotiations with city unions, which agreed to measures such as taking unpaid holidays in 2026. Additional cost-saving strategies included scaling back hiring in the police and fire departments and moving employees targeted for layoffs into vacant positions in other departments, successfully closing a projected $1 billion budget shortfall.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officially announced that it will implement a challenge system for ball and strike calls starting in the 2026 season. Powered by the automated strike zone (ABS) technology tested extensively in the minor leagues, the system will allow each team two challenges per game, which are retained if a call is overturned. Batters, pitchers, and catchers can initiate a challenge, which will be resolved by an automated video review, striking a balance between preserving the umpire's role and correcting clear errors in high-stakes situations.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to dramatically increase the fee for H-1B skilled worker visas in the U.S., experts are encouraging Canada to seize the opportunity to attract displaced talent. The significant fee hike is expected to limit opportunities for foreign workers, particularly recent international graduates from U.S. universities. While Canada has previously been a popular alternative for skilled immigrants, some analysts caution that the country's own immigration system faces challenges and may not be as predictable or attractive as it once was.</p>

          <p>Consumers are rushing to dealerships to purchase electric vehicles before the federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones expire on September 30. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by the Trump administration, leading to a record surge in EV sales in August. Dealerships are offering additional incentives to clear inventory, but there is concern within the industry that the sales momentum could sharply decline once the government subsidies are no longer available.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has made home equity loans a more affordable option for homeowners seeking to borrow funds. For a $40,000 loan, current monthly payments are slightly lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, with a 15-year loan now costing around $389 per month. The article also notes that Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently have even lower average rates, but their variable nature makes long-term costs less predictable compared to the fixed rates of a standard home equity loan.

Parker, one of five judges, expressed how difficult it was to eliminate books from the longlist but called the experience of reading and discussing the novels a distinct privilege.</p>

The animal was discovered by a landowner who spotted its antlers sticking out of the ground and alerted authorities.

The entire operation took five hours, after which the moose, appearing unharmed, ran off into the woods, leaving rescuers with a heartwarming and successful conclusion.</p>
