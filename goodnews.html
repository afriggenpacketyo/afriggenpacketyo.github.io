          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, marking the third extension since his inauguration. Citing national security concerns, the law requires TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sever ties with the app or face being cut off from U.S. app stores. Trump, who vowed to save TikTok during his campaign, signed an executive order on Thursday which has delayed the date for enforcing the law for a third time. TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension and his leadership and support.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a retrial marked by intense scrutiny and a mistrial in 2024. The defense argued Read was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement, while prosecutors claimed she hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The case involved conflicting timelines, disputed evidence, and allegations of misconduct by investigators, drawing significant media attention. Read was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, but the most serious charges did not stick.</p>

Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year, requiring ByteDance to fully sever ties with TikTok or face being cut off from U.S. app stores.

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. The changes will remove property size and energy score requirements, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million households with children. While the cost could be covered by raising fees on all customer bills through the standing charge, unless savings can be found by suppliers, debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move. The government also aims to expand automatic compensation schemes for energy customers experiencing issues like long hold times or unexpectedly high bills.</p>

          <p>In an era of heightened sensitivity and widespread offense-taking, learning to manage one's reactions to perceived slights can significantly improve quality of life. Understanding the psychological and neurological mechanisms behind taking offense, such as the activation of the limbic system, is the first step toward controlling responses. Strategies to mitigate offense include using humor, activating the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and limiting exposure to controversial media content. Ultimately, the ability to avoid taking offense can be a source of strength and resilience.</p>

While some doubt the historical accuracy of this theory, Edmunds and her daughter believe in the power of symbols and oral history, especially during times when the nation's history of slavery is being challenged.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, holds a unique place in Thai culture as a common offering at spirit houses, which honor spirits' claim to the land. This practice stems from animism mixed with Brahmanism, where appeasing spirits through offerings is believed to bring protection and blessings. The red color of the soda is thought to be symbolic, replacing past offerings of blood, while its sweetness caters to spirits' preferences. The choice of Fanta is likely due to the brand's long-standing presence in Thailand, making it a readily available and culturally relevant offering.</p>

          <p>Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako on Thursday renewed their hope for peace as they visited Hiroshima to pay their respects to atomic bomb victims on the 80th anniversary year of the end of World War II. In their first trip to the city since the emperor's accession in 2019, the imperial couple laid white flowers and bowed deeply at a cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which holds the names of around 340,000 victims of the Aug. 6, 1945, atomic bombing. They then listened to stories from three survivors in their early 90s, joined by two younger people in their 20s and 30s who are helping pass on memories of the bombing.</p>
