        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve implemented a quarter-point interest rate cut, the first of the year, in an effort to support a slowing labor market. The decision aligns with long-standing demands from President Trump for lower rates, though he has publicly called for more substantial cuts. This move occurs amid a complex economic environment with concerns of stagflation and a contentious political backdrop involving Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed's board of governors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut is set to have a mixed but tangible impact on household finances. Consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, will likely see their interest costs decrease almost immediately. Conversely, savers may experience lower returns on high-yield savings accounts and CDs. The effect on longer-term fixed rates, like mortgages, is expected to be more gradual and has largely been priced into current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day through naturally fermented fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in figs and plums, staples of the chimps' diet, confirming a steady, low-level exposure to alcohol. This discovery lends strong support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary origins tied to the diets of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who recently declared that the ultra-low-cost airline model is failing. Biffle argued that the industry's main problem is an oversupply of domestic flights, not a flawed business model, emphasizing Frontier's significantly lower operating costs compared to larger carriers. This executive dispute highlights the intense competition and strategic disagreements within the U.S. airline industry as it navigates post-pandemic challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent decline in the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to its lowest level since 2022 has prompted a significant 59.8% weekly surge in refinancing applications. This spike in homeowner interest is largely fueled by anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, which could further lower borrowing costs. Homeowners who purchased their homes with higher rates in 2023 and 2024, or those with adjustable-rate mortgages, are considered the most likely to benefit from the current rate environment.

This potential continued rise is attributed to several factors, including the possibility of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which often increase gold's appeal over yielding assets. Additionally, persistent inflation and broader economic uncertainty may be driving more investors toward gold as a traditional safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>
