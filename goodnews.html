          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software for China, according to announcements from semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. Both California-based companies confirmed they are working to restore access for their Chinese customers after the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security reversed the ban. The original restrictions, implemented in May, had required these firms and others like Siemens EDA to obtain special licenses for exporting their products to China. This policy change signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Armenia is looking to elevate its relationship with China to a strategic partnership, moving to diversify its foreign policy beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. In an exclusive interview, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations are ready to deepen relations "without any limitations." This diplomatic shift follows Armenia's dissatisfaction with Russia's lack of intervention in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent conflicts with Azerbaijan. The move represents a significant effort by Armenia to build new alliances and strengthen its international standing.</p>

          <p>Amid a contentious vote on a major domestic spending bill with a slim Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote has drawn attention to House rules. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House of Representatives has no such mechanism. According to official House procedure, if a vote on any question or motion results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed. This rule underscores the high stakes for party leadership when managing a narrow majority, as every single vote becomes critical to passing legislation.</p>

          <p>China has successfully developed a new hydropower turbine with a 500-megawatt capacity, the largest single-unit capacity in the world. The massive, 80-tonne turbine was designed and built by Harbin Electric Machinery Company and is destined for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. Constructed from highly durable martensitic steel, the component is considered the "heart" of the new power unit.

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic revival, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This boom, the strongest since 2021, is fueled by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by supportive policies from Beijing and a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges. High-profile listings from companies like battery maker CATL and bubble tea retailer Mixue Group have positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that broadly restricted migrants who cross the southern border from being able to seek asylum. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws passed by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had suspended asylum access based on the declaration of an "invasion." The judge's decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms could elevate the risk of breast cancer for some women. The research found that for women under 55 with a uterus, a combination of estrogen and progestin was associated with a slightly increased risk. Conversely, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the treatment was found to reduce the risk. This evolving science highlights the importance of personalized medical advice, as the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors in its safety and effectiveness.</p>
