          <p>The UK government has announced a landmark £150 billion investment package from the United States, described as the largest commercial deal of its kind. A significant portion, £90 billion, will come from asset manager Blackstone over the next decade, with the total investment expected to generate over 7,600 jobs across the country. This influx of capital, which includes commitments from companies like Microsoft, Google, and Boeing, is seen as a major boost to the UK's economic strength and industrial strategy. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a testament to Britain's appeal to global investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a state dinner at Windsor Castle, President Donald Trump delivered a toast celebrating the historic "special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom. He invoked Winston Churchill and emphasized shared values of history, culture, and destiny that bind the two nations. Trump also highlighted the British Empire's role in establishing principles of law, liberty, and free speech, a comment that comes amid contemporary debates in the U.K. over online safety laws and freedom of expression. The remarks were made during an event with King Charles III and other members of the royal family.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a quarter-point interest rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to a target range of 4%-4.25%, the lowest in nearly three years. Projections from the "dot plot" indicate the potential for two more cuts in the current year, followed by a slower pace of reductions in subsequent years, aiming for a neutral rate around 3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, which, combined with a divided outlook among officials, led to a mixed and uncertain reaction in the financial markets. The decision reflects the central bank's complex challenge of balancing inflation concerns with a potentially weakening economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to the UK has been marked by notable fashion choices, often referred to as 'fashion diplomacy.' First Lady Melania Trump's attire, including a dramatic wide-brimmed purple hat and a striking yellow Carolina Herrera gown for the state banquet, drew significant attention. Similarly, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, wore a show-stopping golden gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley, paired with the historic Lover's Knot Tiara. These sartorial selections are analyzed by experts as symbolic gestures of support and diplomatic messaging, reflecting the high-profile nature of the formal visit.</p>

          <p>UK-based AI startup Nscale has rapidly emerged as a key player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market, securing major partnerships and investments from tech giants. The company, which spun out of a crypto-mining infrastructure firm, announced a $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft and Aker to develop hyperscale AI facilities in Europe. Nvidia also revealed a £500 million equity investment in Nscale, with CEO Jensen Huang championing it as a potential national leader in UK AI infrastructure. These deals position Nscale at the forefront of Europe's push for "sovereign AI," aiming to meet the soaring demand for AI-capable data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record highs and credit card interest rates averaging over 21%, many Americans are finding their payments unaffordable. This article outlines several strategies for those overwhelmed by debt, including consolidation into a single, lower-rate loan to simplify payments and reduce interest costs. Other options include negotiating with creditors for a settlement, which could reduce the principal balance, or entering a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency. For situations where debt is completely unmanageable, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy may provide a necessary financial reset.</p>

          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. The most significant risk reduction, 54%, was observed in individuals who began taking a 500 mg supplement twice daily after their first skin cancer diagnosis. This research provides stronger evidence for a practice already common among dermatologists, who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement to patients with a history of skin cancer. Experts say the findings support routinely recommending nicotinamide for secondary prevention, particularly if started early.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing trawler that sank nearly a century ago. The vessel disappeared during a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The wreck was initially discovered in 2022, but its identity was only confirmed this year after divers were able to examine distinctive features like its double drum trawl winch and steam engine. The discovery provides long-awaited closure for the descendants of the men who were lost at sea.</p>

          <p>In his first meeting, newly-confirmed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter in the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Miran, a close ally of President Trump, voted for a more aggressive half-point reduction, aligning with the President's calls for deeper cuts. His dissent highlights a significant policy division within the Federal Open Market Committee, even as other previously dissenting members like Bowman and Waller aligned with the consensus. The Fed's anonymous "dot plot" projections suggest one member, likely Miran, foresees a much lower interest rate by the end of the year compared to his colleagues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is advancing in Congress with the aim of protecting seniors and vulnerable adults from financial abuse. The legislation would empower financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions if they suspect a client is being exploited. This measure is designed to provide a crucial window to investigate and prevent theft, which costs older Americans an estimated $28.3 billion annually. The bill has been approved by the House Financial Services Committee and reintroduced in the Senate, reflecting cross-party support for strengthening protections against elder fraud.

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 to 2025 due to an issue with door trim. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the trim on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The issue is reportedly related to vehicle assembly rather than a defective part. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim free of charge, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem.</p>
