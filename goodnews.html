          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its digital services tax on large technology companies just before the first payments were due. This move followed President Trump's announcement that he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada over the tax, which he called discriminatory against U.S. firms. Canadian officials stated the withdrawal is intended to support the resumption of negotiations for a new economic arrangement with the United States. The tax would have applied a 3% levy on Canadian revenues of tech giants like Google and Meta. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage clinical trial. These positive results pave the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combo vaccine at the FDA's request, pending this efficacy data. With the new results, Moderna plans to resubmit its applications later this year, hoping for approvals in 2026, which would mark a significant step in simplifying vaccinations.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has given the clearest signal to date that the institution of the Dalai Lama could continue after his passing. Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, he told followers there would be a framework to discuss its continuation, a shift from past statements where he suggested he could be the last. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, but the current leader lives in exile and has a contentious relationship with the Chinese government, which views him as a separatist. He has previously stated his successor would likely be found outside of Tibet and has urged followers to reject any candidate chosen by Beijing.</p>

The released models range from small, lightweight versions to a powerful 424-billion-parameter model. Baidu claims its 300-billion-parameter model outperforms a competitor's model that is twice its size, signaling its intent to compete aggressively in the rapidly growing open-source AI space.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell to 2.0% in June, an unexpected decrease that aligns with the European Central Bank's target for the euro zone. Analysts had predicted a rate of 2.2%, following May's 2.1% reading. This development will likely be welcomed by the ECB as evidence that its monetary policy is successfully curbing inflation, potentially paving the way for another interest rate cut later this year. However, some economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices could still pose risks to the disinflationary trend across the broader European economy.

The analysis contrasts the U.S. focus on individual rights with Latin American constitutions that have historically emphasized collective well-being and social protections. The article highlights how Latin American nations, despite periods of instability often fueled by U.S. intervention, have contributed significantly to international human rights law. It posits that as the U.S. grapples with its own political challenges, the region's focus on the common good offers valuable lessons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, emphasizes that understanding dogs begins with appreciating their primary sense: smell. In her research, she explores how a dog's olfactory-focused world differs from the human visual one. For dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are crucial pieces of information that create a map of their environment. Horowitz suggests that dogs perceive the passage of time through the fading intensity of scents, meaning a person's presence lingers in a room long after they've left. This fundamental difference in perception creates a delightful mystery in the human-canine bond.</p>
