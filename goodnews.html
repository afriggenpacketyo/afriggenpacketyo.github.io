This milestone follows her work in spring training and minor leagues since 2016. The article highlights other groundbreaking female officials who paved the way in prominent men's leagues, including Shannon Eastin and Sarah Thomas in the NFL, and Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner in the NBA.

          <p>China's export growth in July significantly surpassed market expectations, climbing 7.2% in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, while imports recorded their biggest jump in a year, rising 4.1%. This data indicates a strong recovery in import levels and robust export support for the Chinese economy so far this year. Despite this positive trade performance, the country's factory activity unexpectedly deteriorated in July, and a critical tariff truce with the U.S. is set to expire soon, introducing potential future uncertainties for its trade balance.

          <p>Astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring from NASA less than five months after returning from an unexpectedly extended nine-month stay aboard the International Space Station. His prolonged mission resulted from a troubled test flight of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which he co-piloted, experiencing thruster outages and gas leaks. NASA ultimately deemed returning on Starliner too risky, instead bringing him and Suni Williams back on SpaceX's Crew-9. Despite the significant challenges, Wilmore consistently maintained that they were "prepared and committed" and expressed a theoretical willingness to fly Starliner again after necessary fixes.</p>

          <p>Bandleader and pianist Eddie Palmieri, a towering and innovative figure in Latin music, has died at the age of 88. Renowned for his "pounding rhythms" and fusion of syncopated Afro-Caribbean beats with jazz stylings, Palmieri's career spanned decades, yielding more than half a dozen Grammy Awards. His orchestra, La Perfecta, produced iconic songs like "Bilongo" and "Café," characterized by his full-bodied, percussive piano playing. Palmieri was also honored with a Jazz Master Fellowship and had his song "Azúcar Pa' Ti" added to the Library of Congress, cementing his lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has debuted its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile system in Australia, marking its first deployment overseas and beyond the continental U.S. This significant move demonstrates the U.S. Army's ability to rapidly deploy and operate advanced capabilities in support of its allies and partners. The land-based, maneuverable missile can travel at speeds over 6,100 km/h and strike targets more than 2,700 km away. Experts interpret this deployment as a "flexing of military muscle" by Washington, underscoring the importance of the U.S.-Australia alliance and strengthening defense cooperation with China in mind.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans a significant crackdown on unsafe cosmetic practices by proposing new regulations that require licenses for clinics offering fillers and Botox. Additionally, risky non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to only qualified health professionals. These proposals aim to protect consumers from exploitation and severe harm, with age restrictions also planned for certain beauty procedures. The industry has largely welcomed the initiative, which follows years of concern over unregulated practices and incidents of serious complications, including a reported death. Implementation will require public consultation and parliamentary approval.</p>
