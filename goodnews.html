          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in Game 1 of the NCAA Super Regionals, overcoming an early two-run deficit. Pitcher Michael Barnett delivered six innings of two-run ball, supported by a strong defensive performance from the Bruins, while Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided crucial insurance. The Bruins stranded 13 runners on base, showcasing both their offensive potential and struggles with capitalizing on opportunities. With this win, UCLA is one step closer to reaching the College World Series in Omaha.</p>

          <p>China is focusing on grassroots football development as part of a plan initiated by President Xi Jinping to become a world football superpower by 2050. Despite setbacks for the men's national team and anti-corruption efforts in the football sector, significant progress has been made in expanding football infrastructure and introducing football courses in schools. Grassroots tournaments, such as the Jiangsu City Football League, are gaining popularity and boosting morale.

          <p>A recent study suggesting the detection of potential biosignatures on the distant planet K2-18b is now being re-evaluated by scientists due to concerns about noisy data and modeling limitations. While the initial study identified molecules associated with life, new findings suggest these compounds could also form without biological activity. Multiple teams are conducting further analyses, and the lead author of the original study stands by the initial findings. The succession of research papers illustrates the complexities of searching for extraterrestrial life and the high burden of proof required for such claims.</p>

          <p>A Macau conglomerate, HN Group, is targeting affluent retirees in Hong Kong with a new luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai's Hengqin district, capitalizing on the limited high-end retirement options available in Hong Kong. Serensia Woods, a 13,500-square-meter retirement community, includes a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa. With average prices starting at HK$10 million, the project aims to tap into Hong Kong's growing demographic of seniors, with 36% of the population expected to be over 65 by 2046. The development seeks to provide a higher level of professional care compared to typical at-home retirement options in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure from some venture capitalists to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some argue that Europe needs to embrace overwork to compete with the US and China, many founders and VCs believe that Europe's success lies in sustainable innovation cultures and work-life balance. They emphasize the importance of adequate funding and resources over excessive working hours, citing examples of successful European companies that have thrived without adopting the '996' model. The younger generation is less tolerant of toxic hustle cultures and prioritizes work-life balance.</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai argues for a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence, advocating for treating AI systems as children that need to be parented by good role models. In his new book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," De Kai suggests that since AI learns by absorbing everything we do and say online, we need to be conscientious about our behavior around AI systems. This approach aims to ensure AI develops in a way that benefits humanity rather than leading to its demise. De Kai emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in AI development.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona, is being highlighted to counter myths about African literacy and showcase women's roles in pre-colonial societies. Sona, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, features geometric patterns carrying mathematical and cosmological principles, originally taught by women. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to revive this cultural heritage, nearly erased by colonialism, through social media and community research. The initiative also includes showcasing other artifacts, like leather cloaks, to emphasize the disruption of Zambian histories and the deliberate removal of women's roles.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are conducting trials using "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can replace antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut. Early data suggests this approach can effectively flush out superbugs from the bowel, offering a new strategy for tackling infections that resist antibiotics. This innovative treatment aims to restore a healthy gut microbiome and prevent superbugs from spreading to other parts of the body.</p>
