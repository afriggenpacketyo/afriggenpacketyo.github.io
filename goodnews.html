          <p>Alpine has announced that Franco Colapinto will replace Jack Doohan in their Formula 1 lineup for the next five races, starting immediately. This decision comes after a review of the season's opening races, with Alpine seeking to evaluate its driver options thoroughly. Flavio Briatore, Alpine's executive advisor, emphasized the importance of assessing drivers fairly, particularly with the 2026 season in mind. Doohan remains an integral part of the team and will serve as the first-choice reserve driver during this period, as Alpine prepares for an important season in 2026.</p>

          <p>The Labour government is highlighting its trade deal with Delhi to deflect from domestic political pressures, including criticisms over the removal of the Winter Fuel Payment. However, the Conservative party and Reform UK have criticized the deal's provision allowing Indian workers to avoid national insurance contributions. While the government emphasizes the economic benefits for the north of England, the Midlands, and Scotland, the deal's details are still being finalized and face scrutiny. The deal is set against the backdrop of ongoing trade negotiations with the US and the EU, with a summit planned with the EU later this month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal faces Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final second leg, aiming to overturn a 1-0 deficit, and manager Mikel Arteta plans to use "rage, anger, frustration" to motivate the team. Thomas Partey's return to midfield could prove decisive, while PSG's Ousmane Dembele's fitness remains a concern. Despite Arsenal's historical struggles in semi-finals, the tactical adjustments made by Arteta during the first leg offer reasons for optimism. With both teams having Champions League ghosts, the tie remains finely balanced.</p>

          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with police and a charity to safeguard at-risk children. Providing crucial after-dark insights, these women have been instrumental in prosecuting child sexual assault offenders and identifying exploited children. The Night Light initiative has facilitated numerous reports about dangerous men and highlighted young individuals vulnerable to exploitation. The trust established between the sex workers and the Night Light team has been pivotal to the project's success, with sex workers expressing a desire to prevent similar experiences for young people.</p>

          <p>China has revealed a series of measures designed to help its economy navigate the effects of the escalating trade war with the United States, hours after exploratory peace talks were announced. The measures include plans to cut interest rates and reduce bank reserve requirements to help free up more funding for lending. It will be hoped that bolstering activity in the economy will help lift prices generally as the country battles deflation. It is thought this will ease pressure on the Chinese Yuan.</p>
