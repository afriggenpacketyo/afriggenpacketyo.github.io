          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a veteran New York Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party, the 78-year-old congressman stated his decision was influenced by the challenges facing the country. First elected in 1992, Nadler had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as an impeachment manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up his seat for a new generation of leadership.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Beijing have designed a potential solution for astronauts' laundry needs: a compact, detergent-free washing machine that uses mist and ozone. The device, developed by the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, weighs only 12kg and uses a mere 400ml of water per cycle. It cleans clothes with an ultra-fine mist and sterilizes them with ozone generated by ultraviolet light, allowing garments to be worn multiple times. This innovation addresses the significant challenge of managing laundry on long-duration spaceflights where water is a scarce resource.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to amend the law to give the justice secretary the authority to veto new sentencing guidelines issued by the independent Sentencing Council for England and Wales. The move follows a recent dispute over proposed guidance that would have required courts to consider the backgrounds of offenders from certain minority groups. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that while judicial independence in individual cases remains paramount, overarching policy must be set by elected parliamentarians who are accountable to the public.</p>

The victory, his quickest ever in a Grand Slam, sets up the first all-Italian men's quarter-final at a major against Lorenzo Musetti. Sinner capitalized on Bublik's numerous errors, including 13 double faults, to extend his winning streak at hard-court Grand Slams to 25 matches.

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, is drawing attention to the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. In a tour of the estate, she pointed out numerous obstacles, from heavy doors with difficult-to-use handles to a lack of accessible toilets near key areas. Tidball argues that while 22% of the voting-age population is disabled, the physical and procedural barriers in Parliament make it difficult for the institution to reflect society. She is advocating for urgent changes to make the building more inclusive for future disabled MPs and visitors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an alert from lawyers about a hurried plan to remove hundreds of children. The judge justified the extraordinary measure by noting the government's attempt to execute the plan during a holiday weekend. The administration argued it was repatriating children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.</p>
