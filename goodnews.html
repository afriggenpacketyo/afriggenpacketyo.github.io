          <p>Apple has denied Epic Games' resubmission of Fortnite to the iOS App Store, citing ongoing disputes over payment systems. Epic Games announced that Fortnite will remain offline on iOS worldwide until Apple reverses its decision.

This action comes after a recent court ruling that Apple could not charge commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps.</p>
