        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a roughly 2% increase on Wednesday following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback, coupled with an operating income that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year reached 203.6 billion yen, exceeding the estimated 192.2 billion yen, though it showed an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends, with the financial unit expected to list this year. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March was less optimistic, forecasting only a slight 0.3% rise in operating profit, partially due to the impact of trade relations.</p>

U.S. Marine Corps officials confirmed there were no civilians in the area where it landed and are conducting a thorough examination of the incident while prioritizing the safety of local residents.

          <p>Family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-rich individuals, are experiencing rapid growth but are facing challenges in finding qualified money managers. This talent crunch is attributed to the high level of trust required for such positions, often prioritizing personal relationships over professional qualifications. Family offices also face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent, and young employees are sometimes reluctant to work in family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and career progression. To attract and retain talent, some family offices are offering higher compensation packages, including bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers, aiming to prioritize British personnel, is causing concern among businesses who fear potential labor shortages. Key sectors like health and social care, which heavily rely on migrant staff, are particularly worried about filling vacancies with British workers. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skills levels for migrants, while businesses argue that Brits may be unwilling to fill the gap, especially in lower-paying sectors. The government aims to reduce net migration and link immigration policy with skills to boost economic growth, but faces criticism for potentially undermining critical workforce pipelines.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first decline in months, yet remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu affecting egg-laying hens. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs fell to $5.12, down from a record $6.23 in March, with the overall average price of eggs dropping by 12.7%. Despite this decrease, the April average price for a dozen large eggs was still 79% higher than the previous year. Experts anticipate a further decrease in egg prices in May and June, but caution that potential future bird flu outbreaks could cause prices to rise again.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his decision to accept a $400 million jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, arguing it is a reward for the U.S. military's successful defense of Qatar. The jet, offered due to delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet, will serve as a temporary method of transportation. Trump has stated that the current Air Force One is nearly 40 years old and less impressive compared to planes in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. He clarified that the jet is a gift to the Department of Defense and will be retired to the presidential library once Boeing delivers the new Air Force One fleet.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, both on themselves and others. The study, building on previous findings that chimps self-medicate with certain plants, identified specific behaviors such as dabbing plants on wounds and chewing plants to apply to injuries. Researchers analyzed footage of a young chimpanzee using plant material on its mother's injury and found records of chimps tending to the wounds of unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy. This research adds to growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain their health in the wild.</p>

The invitation, extended by Keir Starmer, reportedly "cut across clear messages" the Canadian government was sending to the White House regarding Canada's sovereignty. This follows Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state, prompting Canada to invite King Charles to open its parliament as a symbol of sovereignty.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over 35 years for the murders of their parents in 1989. Judge Michael Jesic granted the resentencing request, citing their rehabilitation and low risk to public safety, despite opposition from the district attorney. Both brothers expressed remorse and took responsibility for their actions during emotional statements in court. Family members testified in support of their release, highlighting their transformation and contributions to improving the lives of other inmates. The decision follows years of advocacy and renewed interest in the case, setting the stage for a potential parole hearing.</p>
