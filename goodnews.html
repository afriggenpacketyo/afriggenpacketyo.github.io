          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed speculation about his own potential 2028 presidential run, instead endorsing Vice President JD Vance as a strong future candidate for the Republican party. In an interview on Fox News, Rubio praised Vance's performance as vice president and described him as one of his closest friends in politics. Rubio emphasized his satisfaction with his current role as the nation's top diplomat, stating he wishes to serve in President Trump's Cabinet for the duration of the presidency and would consider that the apex of his career.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a special bank holiday to celebrate the English women's football team's victory in the Euro 2025 final. Despite the Lionesses' historic win against Spain in a dramatic penalty shootout, the government appears to be following the precedent set after their 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While a celebratory parade is scheduled in London, the decision against a day off is likely influenced by the significant economic cost, previously estimated by the government to be over £1 billion.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogacar officially won his fourth Tour de France, concluding the race with a comfortable lead over his rivals. The final stage in Paris, which featured a novel and challenging circuit around Montmartre, was won by Belgian rider Wout van Aert after a solo attack. Pogacar finished the three-week race with an overall lead of four minutes and 24 seconds ahead of Jonas Vingegaard, solidifying his dominance in the sport. The inclusion of the steep, cobbled Montmartre climb in the final stage was a new feature that drew mixed reactions from the riders.</p>

          <p>Russia and North Korea have established a regular direct air link, with the first commercial flight operated by Russian carrier Nordwind traveling from Moscow to Pyongyang. The Russian Transport Ministry stated that one flight per month is scheduled to meet demand, a move that reflects the strengthening ties between the two nations. This development follows a visit by Russia's foreign minister to a new North Korean beach resort, where he pledged to encourage Russian tourism, aligning with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost his country's economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and EU have finalized a trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most European exports to America and averting a potential trade war. Announced by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, the deal also includes a major EU commitment to invest $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy. While the agreement brings stability, it sets a higher tariff rate than before the Trump administration and keeps a punitive 50% tariff on steel, creating some complex economic and diplomatic implications for various sectors and allies.
