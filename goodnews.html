          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for $6.1 billion, setting a new record for an American professional sports team. Chisholm's group will initially take at least 51% ownership, with full control anticipated by 2028, potentially increasing the total value to $7.3 billion. This landmark transaction surpasses previous records for sports franchises, reflecting the growing valuations in professional sports. The article notes the Celtics' storied history, including their record 18 NBA championships, with titles in 2008 and 2024 under the previous ownership.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal battle, ruling that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a US composer's work. The court upheld lower court verdicts, determining that composer Jonathan Wright's 2011 version, based on a public domain folk song, lacked "substantial alteration" to be protected by copyright. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation, known for its viral YouTube video and "doo doo doo doo doo doo" refrain, became the most-viewed video on the platform. This article highlights the song's phenomenal success and its origins in 1970s US summer camps.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, practical qualifications equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2) or A-levels (Level 3), often taken alongside or instead of academic courses in the UK. Assessed through coursework, exams, and projects, BTecs are graded on a scale from Pass to Starred Distinction. Research indicates that a quarter of students use them for university entry, while others transition directly into employment with occupation-specific skills. The article also notes recent government decisions to retain funding for many BTecs, acknowledging their importance in key sectors and for diverse student needs.</p>

          <p>Voltify, a startup, is ambitiously aiming to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. rail industry by transitioning freight locomotives from diesel to rechargeable batteries, a business model projected to generate up to $10 billion annually. The company's "VoltCars" are sodium-ion batteries designed to connect to existing trains, offering potential savings of $94 billion over 20 years for rail companies. Despite initial skepticism from the traditional industry regarding charging time and power supply, Voltify is developing an algorithm to forecast energy demands and building solar-powered microgrids. This article highlights the company's pilot projects with major railroad companies, aiming for commercial deployment by early 2026.</p>
