          <p>Elliot Anderson, a midfielder for Nottingham Forest, is anticipated to make his international debut for England in the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Andorra. This marks his first call-up by head coach Thomas Tuchel, and he is expected to feature in the midfield alongside Arsenal's Declan Rice and Eberechi Eze. The match, taking place at Villa Park, will also see Harry Kane captaining the side, with other key players like Dan Burn and Marc Guehi forming the central defense. This lineup signals a strategic selection by Tuchel for a crucial qualifying game.</p>

A 13-person governance board, including former aides and allies like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been established to spearhead the project. The foundation faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate, with costs for such libraries often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The library aims to feature an immersive museum and serve as a center for civic engagement and leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7th, around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. The alert will cause compatible phones on 4G and 5G networks to vibrate and emit a siren sound for about ten seconds. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced some technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed. Users can opt out of receiving these alerts through their phone's settings.</p>

          <p>Scotland's winning streak in the Women's Rugby World Cup was ended by a strong Canadian team in Exeter, setting up a likely quarter-final match against host nation England. Despite a competitive performance and tries from Rhona Lloyd, Evie Gallagher, and Francesca McGhie, the Scots were ultimately overpowered by Canada, who secured the top spot in Pool B. The Canadian team demonstrated their strength with multiple scores, including two tries from Emily Tuttosi. The result solidifies Canada's position as a tournament favorite while presenting a formidable challenge for Scotland in the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in to a live-streamed event showcasing a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) exploring the depths of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The dive, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the challenges it faces from pollution. Experts provided commentary on the lake's ancient geological history and the unique life forms on its bed, which is over 1,500 feet below the surface. The event also served to dispel local myths while highlighting the real issue of trash found in previous cleanup efforts.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has presented a detailed plan to PepsiCo's board aimed at improving the company's performance and stock value. The proposal suggests refranchising the bottling network for its North American beverage business, a move that would reverse a costly 2010 decision. Elliott also recommends divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, reducing the number of products to cut costs, and reinvesting the freed capital into iconic brands such as Pepsi and Gatorade. The firm, which holds a $4 billion stake, argues these strategic shifts could result in at least a 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur has effectively placed former Arsenal CEO Vinai Venkatesham in charge of its operations. Appointed as Tottenham's chief executive in April, Venkatesham is known for his inclusive and understated leadership style, contrasting with Levy's reputation as a tough negotiator. During his 14 years at Arsenal, he was instrumental in appointing manager Mikel Arteta, championed the women's team, and was regarded as an empathetic leader during the pandemic. His move to the rival club signals a significant cultural shift for Tottenham's boardroom and future strategy.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, one of the "founding mothers" of NPR and a pioneering voice in American broadcasting, is retiring after more than 50 years with the network. In 1972, she became the first woman to anchor a daily national evening news broadcast in the U.S. as a co-host of "All Things Considered." Her curious, insightful, and distinctive style helped define NPR's sound and transform it from a fledgling network into a media institution. Stamberg is celebrated for breaking barriers for women in media and for inspiring generations of journalists who followed her.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are expressing significant optimism about recent progress in the fight against dementia, calling it "a very exciting time" for research. Advances include new drugs that can treat symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and a recently FDA-approved blood test that aids in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, a major study known as U.S. POINTER has provided strong evidence that lifestyle interventions—such as physical activity, a healthy diet, and social engagement—can delay memory loss and even improve cognitive function in at-risk individuals. These developments offer new hope for managing and potentially preventing the condition.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and "Saturday Kitchen" host Matt Tebbutt will replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on "MasterChef: The Professionals." Tebbutt will join Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti on the popular cooking competition's judging panel. The change comes after Wallace was dismissed in July following an inquiry that upheld numerous allegations of misconduct, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. Wallace's co-host on the main series, John Torode, was also dismissed over a separate incident, and replacements for that show have not yet been announced.</p>

          <p>China is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to alter the course of an asteroid, a top space researcher has announced. The mission, which could launch this year, will involve sending an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid millions of kilometers from Earth. The goal is to achieve a small but measurable orbital deflection, demonstrating the "kinetic impact" technique for defending the planet. If successful, China would join the United States as the only other nation to have demonstrated this critical planetary defense capability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to record highs, financial experts are offering guidance on how investors can gain exposure to the precious metal. The rally, which has seen bullion gain about 35% this year, is driven by economic uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. Most advisors recommend using gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as the most efficient and low-cost method, rather than purchasing physical bars or coins. While gold is seen as a safe-haven asset, experts typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small percentage of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first Millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his piety and his use of the internet to spread his faith, Acutis has been dubbed the "patron saint of the internet." The Church has embraced his "normal" teen identity—he played video games and wore Nikes—as a way to connect with younger generations. However, his deep devotion, which included creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles, also appeals to more traditionalist Catholics, making him a figure who bridges the modern and mystical aspects of the faith.</p>

          <p>Following a January stop-work order on U.S. foreign aid that closed many HIV clinics in Zambia, the Zambian government has partnered with local community leaders to restore access to medication. After an NPR article highlighted the dire situation, officials investigated and established a process for patients from closed U.S.-funded clinics to register at government facilities for free treatment. While this has resolved the immediate medication crisis for thousands, many now face new challenges, as the former clinics also provided crucial food support, which is no longer available, leaving many patients struggling with hunger.</p>
