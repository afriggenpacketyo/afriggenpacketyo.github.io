          <p>Justice Jackson authored a unanimous Supreme Court decision in *Ames v. Ohio*, a case involving sexual orientation discrimination. The case involved a heterosexual woman who alleged she was discriminated against when a lesbian was hired instead of her, and later demoted and replaced by a gay man. The decision and its implications are analyzed in the context of the broader debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and how the law should treat individuals versus members of a group. The case highlights the complexities and nuances of discrimination claims and the ongoing legal and social discussions surrounding DEI. </p>

While Jude plays as an attacking midfielder, Jobe can play as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder. Jobe played 43 times for Sunderland in the 2024-25 season, scoring four goals and registering three assists. </p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the top five reasons couples fight, which include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, communication styles, and money. Tone of voice or attitude is the most common reason, signaling contempt, a predictor of divorce. Family relations often reflect unmet needs, especially in parenting. Uneven distribution of labor and the "invisible load" cause arguments about chores. Communication styles can derail conversations, and financial disagreements reflect deeper issues. </p>
