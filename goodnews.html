          <p>The New York Yankees achieved a remarkable feat by hitting nine home runs in a 13-3 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays, becoming the first team in MLB history to have multiple games with nine or more homers in a single season. The offensive showcase began in the first inning with back-to-back-to-back home runs from Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger, and Giancarlo Stanton. Judge's home run was his 40th of the season, placing him in the elite company of Yankees legends like Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle. The dominant performance secured the team's fourth consecutive win and highlighted their renowned power-hitting capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Texas has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a state law that would have required all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, Senate Bill 10, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses by amounting to unconstitutional religious coercion. The lawsuit was filed by a diverse group of families, represented by organizations like the ACLU, who argued the mandate infringes on their right to direct their children's religious upbringing. The ruling prevents the law from taking effect on September 1, with advocates hailing it as a victory for religious freedom and the separation of church and state.</p>

An analysis of a $125,000 deposit shows significant earning potential across various terms, ranging from approximately $1,323 over three months to nearly $28,550 over five years. CDs provide predictability amidst market volatility, as the interest rate is locked for the duration of the term, guaranteeing a specific return.

          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, citing solid performance from both DIY customers and home professionals. Concurrent with its earnings release, the company announced a major strategic move to acquire Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion, aiming to strengthen its business with professional contractors. Despite the positive results, CEO Marvin Ellison noted that demand for larger home projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates and anticipates a market pickup when rates fall. The company has revised its full-year outlook to reflect the acquisition, signaling a focus on pro-customer growth to navigate the challenging housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first-ever $1 billion revenue month in July, underscoring its rapid growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Despite this financial milestone, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing immense pressure from the voracious demand for GPUs and processing power needed to train and run its AI models. This demand is driving OpenAI to aggressively expand its infrastructure, including the Stargate supercomputer project and partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave. The company's revenue is projected to triple to $12.7 billion this year as it continues to scale its operations to meet ever-growing enterprise and consumer needs.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists led by the University of Oxford has developed a nutritional "superfood" that could help save honeybee populations threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and disease. The supplement provides all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly lipids called sterols that have historically been difficult to manufacture. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the new food produced up to 15 times more offspring that survived to adulthood. This breakthrough offers a way to support bee health even when natural pollen is scarce, which is crucial for pollinating approximately 70% of the world's leading crops.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova has announced a new investment of at least $41 million into its Schenectady, New York, facility to expand its generator manufacturing operations. This move is intended to increase capacity for its gas power business, which is experiencing unprecedented demand largely fueled by the massive energy requirements of new AI data centers. The investment will enhance the production of key generator models that are paired with the company's heavy-duty gas turbines, which are reportedly sold out for the next several years. This expansion addresses the urgent need for more power-generating capacity as electricity consumption surges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of Western countries, including France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Malta, has announced preparations to formally recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This move is seen as a significant diplomatic step to advance a two-state solution, particularly as Israel's current government has explicitly rejected Palestinian statehood. The recognition is intended to bolster the diplomatic efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over the armed resistance of Hamas, thereby rewarding a commitment to negotiation. This action could also complicate Israeli annexation ambitions in the West Bank, the territory considered the only viable land for a future Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage recorded in nearly 90 years of the survey. This decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of Americans now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. This growing skepticism is most pronounced among young adults but is also increasing across all age groups. The findings suggest that years of public health information linking alcohol to negative outcomes, including cancer, are influencing behavior and leading to lower consumption rates nationwide.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) could see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated interest rate cuts in the coming months. Since HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a reduction in the federal funds rate would likely lead to lower interest charges on outstanding balances. However, the timing of this relief depends on the individual lender's adjustment schedule, which can be immediate, monthly, or quarterly. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan terms to understand their specific rate index, margin, and any potential rate floors that could limit savings. (not investment advice)</p>
