          <p>A controversial plan to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land across 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee to supposedly ease housing costs, faced strong bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups. Lee stated he withdrew the provision because he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not foreign interests or large corporations.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned lottery company, Norsk Tipping, has issued a major apology after erroneously informing thousands of Eurojackpot players that they had won substantially larger prizes than they actually did. The error stemmed from a currency conversion mistake where winnings were multiplied by 100 instead of being correctly calculated. The company's CEO, who has since resigned, expressed deep regret for the disappointment caused to those who had briefly believed they were millionaires.</p>
