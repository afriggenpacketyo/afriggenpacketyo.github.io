          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a luxury apartment building called The Hartby after a $104 million project. Developers Matt Linde and Udi Kore secured a 99-year ground lease to convert the deteriorating former St. John's College site, which had been vacant since 1972. The project preserved the building's historic architectural elements while creating 205 modern units, including 62 designated for affordable housing. The successful revitalization has been embraced by the local community and the neighboring church, turning a neglected landmark into a functional and profitable property.</p>

In 2017, she founded the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet to pass on the culture to a new generation. Despite her success in the competitive modeling industry, she considers herself a cultural ambassador, using her own funds to support the dance group and provide a positive outlet for youth in her community.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 by President Carter and later the CIA in 1987 by President Reagan, Webster was known as a principled troubleshooter who restored public confidence in both agencies during turbulent times. His leadership was credited with navigating the FBI past the abuses of the J. Edgar Hoover era and stabilizing the CIA after the Iran-Contra scandal. Webster was widely respected for his integrity and commitment to the rule of law throughout his long career in public service.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, has updated his guidance for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that due to a more diversified portfolio including small-cap and international stocks, a retiree's safe initial withdrawal rate could now be closer to 4.7%, and potentially even higher for current retirees. Bengen emphasizes that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario and encourages retirees to personalize their strategy. He also notes that inflation remains the greatest threat to retirement portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who became one of Europe's most celebrated still-life painters, even more famous in her time than Rembrandt or Vermeer. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, Ruysch developed a unique eye for the natural world, which she channeled into her meticulously detailed and vibrant flower paintings. The piece delves into the context of the Dutch Golden Age, the symbolism within her work, and how she navigated a male-dominated field while raising ten children. It highlights her as a master who elevated the genre of flower painting to new heights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, reiterates a long-standing scientific consensus that there is no supernatural mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the region means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is not unusual compared to any other well-traveled area of the ocean. This explanation, based on simple probability, is supported by institutions like the U.S. Coast Guard and Lloyd's of London. The article notes that environmental factors, such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather and complex navigation, are the likely culprits for the incidents.</p>

Many of the contestants, including Petunia, are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills. Petunia and her owner, Shannon Nyman, received a $5,000 prize for the victory.

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones are modeling behavior that can negatively impact their children's development and success. She notes that children often mirror their parents' screen habits, which can lead to issues with attention span, sleep, and mental health. Robbins advises parents to first look at their own behavior, such as keeping phones off the dinner table and out of the bedroom, before criticizing their kids. By being more present and getting curious about their children's online activities, parents can foster better connections and model a healthier balance with technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a 2025 Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe an average net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy, a decrease from $2.5 million last year. However, the benchmark varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a need for $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. Despite the high figures, the survey found that many Americans define wealth more broadly, equating it with happiness, health, and relationships. The threshold for feeling "financially comfortable" is much lower, at an average of $839,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a sign of potentially easing tensions, North Korea has started to remove some of the propaganda loudspeakers it uses to broadcast messages across the demilitarized zone (DMZ). This action follows a similar move by South Korea, which dismantled its own speakers and halted broadcasts after the election of President Lee Jae Myung, who has pursued better inter-Korean relations. The loudspeaker broadcasts, featuring everything from K-pop songs to unsettling noises, had been a source of annoyance for border residents and a symbol of the countries' hostile relationship. The move is seen as a positive reciprocal gesture between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Traditional enclosed shopping malls in the U.S. are finding new life by replacing defunct anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants, including churches, entertainment venues, and large bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and boosts traffic for other retailers. This trend of "reprogramming the box" involves subdividing large spaces for a mix of tenants to create community hubs and experiential destinations. Data suggests this strategy is working, with mall traffic increasing as they evolve beyond purely retail-focused centers.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager named Logan Coleridge experienced debilitating symptoms like dizziness and severe headaches for months. When physical therapy and medication failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed the true cause: a rare, congenital brain condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The AVM, a dangerous tangle of blood vessels, was likely the source of his long-term issues. Following successful brain surgery to remove the malformation, Logan has made a full recovery and is preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that nearly a quarter of Americans, and over a third of Gen Z and millennials, have used "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford expensive concert tickets. With ticket prices soaring due to "funflation," these short-term loans offer a tempting way to spread out costs. However, financial analysts caution that while many BNPL plans are interest-free, some carry high interest rates and fees, and may lack the consumer protections of credit cards. Instead of relying on debt, experts suggest proactively budgeting for entertainment by creating a dedicated savings fund. (not investment advice)</p>

Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 and convicted of espionage, having received millions from the Soviets. Grimes's determined work is remembered for bringing a traitor to justice.</p>
