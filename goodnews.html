          <p>Former Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale is reportedly part of a US-based consortium attempting to take over League One club Plymouth Argyle. Talks with the private equity firm are in the early stages, following a previous agreement to sell a stake in the club that fell through. Bale would follow in the footsteps of Luka Modric, who became part of the group that acquired control of Swansea in November 2024. It is not known what role, if any, Bale would have at Plymouth should the takeover succeed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is implementing cost-cutting measures and rethinking its policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies. The Army Transformation Initiative aims to restructure the military branch and shift defense dollars towards products that can be made quickly and cheaply. The initiative expands beyond the traditional acquisition process to infuse formations with effective battlefield technologies. A new type of military unit, a "transformation in contact" (TIC) brigade, is being equipped with AI-enabled platforms, SpaceX Starlink internet connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and drones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the subdued market reaction to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, noting that major U.S. stock benchmarks opened higher, oil prices fell, and gold prices edged lower. Traders and investors are betting that the conflict will not escalate into a broader regional crisis that disrupts the global economy. Analysts emphasize that the price of oil and the potential for Iran to shut down the Strait of Hormuz are key factors influencing the market. Despite geopolitical risks, increased oil production from OPEC is counterbalancing concerns and preventing a significant price spike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer and social media personality Nezza claims she sang the national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium against the wishes of the Dodgers organization. A video posted by Nezza shows an employee telling her to sing the song in English. Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hern√°ndez, said the Spanish version was commissioned in 1945 by the U.S. Department of State and that she wanted to sing it amid recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. The Dodgers did not publicly comment on the situation, but a team official said there were no consequences and she would be welcome back.</p>

          <p>U.S. pharmaceutical companies are increasing their licensing deals with China-based biotechs, with potential worth reaching $18.3 billion. This strategy allows American drugmakers faster and cheaper access to promising therapies, rebuilding pipelines before current drugs lose patent protection. Chinese biotech is producing world-class assets, including targeted therapies and first-in-class cancer drugs, at a lower cost. Intellectual property deals are exempt from tariffs, further incentivizing U.S. pharma to invest in China's biotech engine.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission successfully created an artificial solar eclipse using two spacecraft flying in a precise formation. This mission allows scientists to observe the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun, in unprecedented detail. The artificial eclipse blocks out the sun's light, revealing the corona and enabling astronomers to study its properties. This mission aims to improve understanding of solar weather and its impact on telecommunications satellites and power grids on Earth.</p>
