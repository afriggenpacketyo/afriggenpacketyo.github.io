          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! has returned to ABC after a week-long suspension, with host Jimmy Kimmel addressing his controversial remarks regarding the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel issued a public apology, stating it was never his intention to trivialize a young man's death or assign blame to any specific group, acknowledging that his comments were perceived as ill-timed or unclear by some viewers. The comedian's pre-taped monologue, which also highlighted the importance of free speech in America, was met with a warm reception and multiple standing ovations from the studio audience. His return follows a period of intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump and a decision by some ABC affiliates, including Nexstar and Sinclair, to initially preempt the show's broadcast, further intensifying the political and media landscape debates.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, has announced its plans to reopen next summer, a year after a devastating July flood of the Guadalupe River claimed the lives of 27 girls and counselors. The camp's reopening will strictly adhere to new safety legislation, bravely championed by the victims' families, which prohibits cabins in dangerous flood zones and mandates detailed emergency plans, staff training, and emergency warning systems. A heartfelt memorial will be constructed to honor those lost in the tragedy, which contributed to a total of 136 fatalities across Texas. While the original 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe remains too damaged for immediate use, its sister site, Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, is set to welcome campers, marking a step towards healing and enhanced safety.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to significantly increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure, surpassing the initially allocated 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, who also chairs Alibaba Cloud, announced this ambitious strategy at the Apsara Conference, articulating a vision for Alibaba Cloud to become the "world's leading full-stack AI service provider," from computing power to advanced models. Wu expressed a strong belief that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will usher in a new era, potentially automating 80% of current jobs and empowering "super scientists and engineers" to tackle global challenges in unprecedented ways. This substantial investment mirrors similar strategic moves by major US tech giants, such as Nvidia's recent $100 billion commitment to OpenAI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has secured a special election victory in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, effectively taking over the congressional seat left vacant by her late father's passing. This win further erodes the Republican's already razor-thin majority in the House. Grijalva, who now holds the distinction of being Arizona's first Latina in Congress, defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the heavily Democratic-leaning district. Her campaign actively criticized President Donald Trump's agenda, particularly the "Big Ugly Bill," and she pledged immediate support for a discharge petition aimed at releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This outcome leaves Republicans with a 219-214 House majority, with two additional vacant seats in Texas and Tennessee still pending special elections later in the year.</p>

          <p>Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, is actively evaluating a significant fundraising round, potentially seeking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion for approximately a 3% stake. This strategic move could reportedly value the crypto company at an astonishing $500 billion, placing it among the world's largest private entities, comparable to tech giants like OpenAI. CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed plans for a private placement from a select group of "high-profile key investors," aiming to "maximize the scale" of Tether's strategy across its existing and new business lines, including stablecoins, artificial intelligence, commodity trading, energy, and media. The company is also advancing its plans to re-enter the U.S. market, partly influenced by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and the introduction of new regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act.

          <p>Claudia Cardinale, the Tunisian-born Italian film star celebrated for her iconic roles in cinematic masterpieces such as The Leopard, 8 1/2, and The Pink Panther, has passed away at the age of 87. Her illustrious career spanned six decades, during which she rose to international prominence during the golden age of Italian cinema, collaborating with legendary directors like Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti. The article reveals an early personal challenge: as a teenager, she was sexually assaulted and, upon discovering her pregnancy, was convinced by a mentor to give birth in secret abroad. For several years, she introduced her son, Patrick, as her younger brother. Cardinale also made a significant impact in Hollywood, starring with actors including Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson, leaving behind a profound legacy as a "free and inspired woman and artiste."</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw has publicly defended his decision to miss a crucial game against the Cincinnati Reds, which carried significant playoff implications, in order to attend a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Shaw, who formed a bond with Kirk over their shared Christian faith, stated he had no regrets about his choice and felt it was his personal duty to be there, accepting any potential backlash. The Cubs ultimately lost the game 1-0, and Shaw's absence meant the team was unable to bring in a replacement player, as he was ineligible for the bereavement list. While his manager and teammates expressed understanding for his personal grief and the human element involved, a Mets play-by-play announcer publicly questioned the decision to miss a game for reasons other than a family emergency during a tight wildcard race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully disrupted a sprawling and sophisticated telecommunications network operating in the New York Tri-State Area, which investigators determined posed a serious potential disruption to New York City's telecom systems and a possible threat to the United Nations General Assembly meetings. This operation, hailed as the largest seizure of its kind, uncovered 300 active SIM servers containing over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. Early analysis indicates the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals linked to organized crime gangs, drug cartels, and human trafficking rings. While no arrests have been made yet, the ongoing investigation aims to identify those behind the well-organized and well-funded scheme, with officials confirming the immediate threat to New York has been dismantled.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have consistently served as a foundational pillar of its macroeconomic policymaking since their inception in 1953, even as the country transitioned away from a traditional command economy decades ago. These 14 implemented plans have been instrumental in transforming China from a nation with limited industrial capacity into the globally recognized "world's factory" through unprecedented scales of mass production. Currently, Beijing is strategically endeavoring to move higher in the global value chain, with an ambitious aspiration to become a leading global hub for innovation in cutting-edge sectors. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is anticipated to be a pivotal document in this ongoing transformation.

          <p>Legendary pop star Lulu, aged 76, has candidly revealed her decades-long struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the experience of sharing her story as profoundly liberating. Now approaching 12 years of sobriety, she sought help in 2013 after unexpectedly confiding in her family during her 65th birthday party, subsequently checking into rehab and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who maintained the facade of a "highly functioning alcoholic" even during her participation in Strictly Come Dancing, had meticulously kept her problem secret from many, including her own son. She traces the roots of her struggles to a "war zone" childhood marked by an alcoholic and abusive father, expressing hope that sharing her story can help break generational patterns and inspire others.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea forward, has effectively seized a first-team lifeline after a potential £22 million move to Fulham surprisingly fell through on deadline day. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George delivered a starring performance in Chelsea's Carabao Cup comeback victory against Lincoln City, where he scored a fine half-volley and then assisted the winning goal. This vital contribution comes as the academy graduate fights for his future at his boyhood club, especially given the influx of other attacking signings and injuries to key players. George's exceptional dedication, which included extensive personal training from a young age, has helped him disrupt the typical Chelsea academy pathway, positioning him for potential first-team success without the need for an initial loan spell.</p>

          <p>The dismembered body parts of an unknown woman, originally found along Oregon's Willamette River in April 1946, are now believed to be the remains of Oak Grove Jane Doe, marking the state's oldest unidentified person case. This complex investigation went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the victim's remains, mysteriously went missing from law enforcement custody without proper documentation. The body was recently unearthed from a grave marked "Unknown Woman 1946" at Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City. State police plan to subject the remains to advanced forensic testing and analysis, holding out hope to finally identify the petite white woman, estimated to be between 30 and 50 years old, who was determined to have been killed by blunt force trauma. The goal is to restore her name and identity to history after nearly 80 years.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike scored the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match against Southampton, securing a 2-1 victory, but was immediately sent off for removing his shirt in celebration, having already received a yellow card earlier in the game. Manager Arne Slot publicly criticized Ekitike's actions as "stupid, not smart," expressing his bemusement that the player likely forgot his previous booking. This unnecessary sending-off means Ekitike will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game against Crystal Palace, a significant setback given his excellent form since joining Liverpool for £69 million. Ekitike later issued an apology on social media, acknowledging that his emotions got the better of him, while Slot expressed hope that the young player will learn from this "important learning experience" to avoid similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering and highly respected scholar of Chinese law, has passed away at the age of 95. For over six decades, Cohen profoundly shaped global debates on China's complex legal system, its trade relations, and human rights issues. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and the founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, he held the distinction of being the first American to practice law in Communist China. He authored groundbreaking works on Chinese criminal procedure and China's interactions with international law, which remain widely read. Known for his dual role as an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, Cohen leaves a towering and influential legacy in the field, having impacted generations of legal scholars and experts on Asian law.</p>
