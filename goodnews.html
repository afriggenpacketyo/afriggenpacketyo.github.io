          <p>Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is increasingly involved with dementia charities, emphasizing music's profound benefits for those affected by memory loss, including his brother Martin. Ferguson, known for his lifelong love of singing, highlights how music can significantly aid individuals dealing with the syndrome, which impacts memory, speech, thought, and behavior. As an ambassador for the Playlist for Life charity, he encourages participation in music-related groups, noting that simply knowing the words to songs can be wonderful. This personal commitment underscores the therapeutic power of music and brings vital attention to dementia awareness and support, reflecting his own concerns about memory as he ages.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland has committed to new legislation ensuring full cooperation with a reformed UK legacy body addressing cases related to the Northern Ireland Troubles, a move designed to heal a significant diplomatic rift. This "new framework," agreed upon by the British and Irish governments, includes establishing a dedicated legacy unit within An Garda Síochána, the Irish police force, and a €25m (£22m) support fund for victims. The current UK Legacy Act, which faced widespread opposition and had key elements ruled unlawful, will be replaced. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be renamed the Legacy Commission with new oversight, enabling Irish state bodies to assist investigations, reflecting efforts to implement the 2014 Stormont House Agreement.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the international unit of China's largest gold and copper miner Zijin Mining, has launched an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, aiming to raise approximately HK$25 billion (US$3.2 billion). This significant offering marks the second-biggest Hong Kong IPO of the year. The listing is anticipated to be popular among both international and local retail investors, especially as the price of gold has surged almost 40% this year, reaching US$3,682 per ounce, driven by global trade uncertainty and central bank buying for safe-haven investments. The deal has already attracted substantial interest, with 29 cornerstone investors, including Singapore wealth fund GIC and Hillhouse, subscribing to a combined HK$12.47 billion worth of shares, representing about 50% of the offering.

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated significant progress on a TikTok deal and a potential extension of a trade truce with China, ahead of a scheduled phone call with President Xi Jinping. Trump stated the US is "pretty close to a deal" for the popular short-video app, which he asserted would be owned by "all American investors" and legitimate companies that "love America," generating a "tremendous fee-plus" for the US. He also mentioned a possible extension of the current trade terms, which he described as "pretty good." This engagement marks the first direct contact between the leaders since June, following Trump's earlier announcement of having reached a "very good trade deal" with China.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% on Friday, aligning with economists' forecasts, despite Japan's core inflation rate falling to 2.7% in August—its lowest since November 2024 and a third consecutive monthly decline. This decision, made by a 7-2 majority, underscores the BOJ's cautious stance amidst slowing inflation and global uncertainty. Analysts believe the strategy supports an early reflationary cycle, distinct from rate cuts seen in the US and Europe. While some call for rate hikes due to inflation remaining above the 2% target, others argue high headline inflation is distorted by supply constraints and exogenous factors.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 2-1 victory against the San Francisco Giants, extending their National League West division lead to three games, despite a challenging and often precarious performance from their bullpen. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5⅓ scoreless innings but issued a career-high six walks, forcing the bullpen into early action. Though relievers Michael Kopech and Blake Treinen battled command issues, they ultimately managed to execute critical pitches, notably escaping a bases-loaded jam in the seventh inning. This hard-fought win, characterized by the team's ability to grind out a one-run game, offers a much-needed confidence boost for the bullpen as the team approaches the postseason, with potential reinforcements also on the horizon.</p>

The judge cited the administration's "un-reasoned mass terminations" via unspecific form letters as a likely violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, calling it a "fundamental sin."

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut and signals for more reductions are expected to create room for Asian central banks to ease monetary policy. This move narrows the gap between U.S. and Asian bond yields, alleviating currency concerns and allowing economies facing domestic headwinds to lower rates. Some Asian banks, like South Korea's and Australia's, have already cut rates to counter Trump administration tariffs. While conditions vary, export-dependent economies are likely to see further easing, with India also prioritizing domestic growth. China and Japan, however, are largely defying this trend, with Japan aiming to raise rates and China balancing stimulus with market stability concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
