          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country. The move comes as part of the Strategic Defence Review, prompted by lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. Ministers assert that this investment will strengthen the armed forces, boost the UK's economy, and ensure the country's security at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for use in adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus. This approval comes with limitations, as it is not intended as a replacement for Moderna's existing vaccine, Spikevax. The new vaccine allows for a lower dose due to its refined immune target and has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in studies. The FDA's restrictions reflect concerns about vaccine skepticism, particularly from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contrasting with previous broad recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions following one of the driest springs on record, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and even retail prices. The lack of rain has led to exceptionally dry soil, increased wildfire risk, and low levels in major waterways like the Rhine, affecting transport costs. Experts warn that increasing global warming will exacerbate these issues, making it crucial to implement water conservation measures. Efforts to save water include retaining water on land, promoting drip irrigation in agriculture, and investing in drought-resistant plants, this will allow for better regulation of the use of the country's water supply.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life, but there are exceptions for individuals covered by employer-provided health insurance. If you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying Medicare enrollment also allows for continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer allowed once enrolled in Medicare. Consulting with the employer's benefits department is recommended to confirm appropriate coverage and eligibility for delaying application.</p>
