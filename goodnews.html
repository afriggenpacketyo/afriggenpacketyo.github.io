          <h2>Harvard Challenges Trump's Restrictions on Foreign Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has filed a complaint against President Trump's action to block foreign students from attending the school, calling it retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The complaint argues that Trump's action circumvents a previous court order that prevented the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard's ability to host foreign students. Harvard contends that Trump's legal justification for the action is invalid and that the measure is intended to punish the university for exercising its First Amendment rights. If the measure stands, it would impact thousands of international students scheduled to attend Harvard. The school argues that it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech. Optimism is tempered by the university's defense against the government's actions.</p>

          <p>Boxer and influencer Jake Paul weighed in on the public dispute between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, suggesting it reflects a broader issue within the Republican Party. Paul described the issue as a problem with 'alpha male egos' and leaders who aren't mature enough to work together. He called for Trump and Musk to collaborate for the benefit of America, not to make the country look bad. Paul has been a vocal supporter of Trump, endorsing him prior to the election and citing statistics about the economy under the Biden-Harris administration. He has also addressed issues such as women‚Äôs reproductive rights and transgender athletes in women‚Äôs sports.</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto's late RBI single helped the Dodgers complete a three-run comeback to defeat the Mets 6-5, securing a series split. The Dodgers overcame a strong performance by Mets southpaw David Peterson, who struck out six and allowed three runs in seven innings. Landon Knack struggled for the Dodgers, giving up four runs in 3 ‚Öì innings, forcing the team to rely on their bullpen. The Dodgers are now two games ahead of the Padres in the NL West, and Justin Wrobleski will be recalled from triple-A Oklahoma City to start Friday against the Cardinals. Conforto's hit was his first with runners in scoring position since March 31.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed stocks that recently hit new 52-week highs to gain insights into market trends and themes. He noted that the list is indicative of the current mood on Wall Street. He identified several companies, including Broadcom, Seagate, and Johnson Controls, as indicative of the data center trend. Cramer also highlighted subscription-based businesses like Netflix and Spotify, as well as Cintas, a uniform-maker with long-term contracts. He said he would be a buyer of any of these names down 5 to 8% from these levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the nation‚Äôs anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether those complaining of bias are white or Black, gay or straight. The justices rejected the view that "members of a majority group" must show more evidence of discrimination before they can sue and win. The ruling revives a discrimination lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who said she was demoted and discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that the law "draws no distinctions between majority-group plaintiffs and minority-group plaintiffs."</p>
