          <p>Nintendo and Sony have cast Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link in the upcoming live-action "Legend of Zelda" movie. The announcement was made by the game's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. The film, directed by Wes Ball of "Maze Runner" fame, is now scheduled for release on May 7, 2027, following production delays. Ball has expressed his desire to create a film with the "wonder and whimsy" of a live-action Hayao Miyazaki work, distinguishing it from typical fantasy epics like "Lord of the Rings."</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao is set to return to the ring at age 46 after a four-year absence, challenging 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios. The fight, scheduled for Las Vegas, represents a significant test for Pacquiao, who aims to become one of the oldest champions in boxing history. His last competitive bout was a loss in 2021, but Pacquiao insists his passion and rigorous training will lead him to victory. The event also marks the professional debut of his son, Emmanuel, on the undercard, a moment Pacquiao described as a "blessing from God."</p>

          <p>The Texas National Guard's response to devastating floods has been bolstered by international assistance, with a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic arriving to help. The team, including cadaver dogs, is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, a long-standing military relationship. With approximately 100 people still missing, the recovery effort remains intensive. The Texas National Guard has rescued over 500 people since the flooding began, with support also coming from other states like Arkansas and North Dakota, which provided a drone for surveying debris.</p>

          <p>Qatar has initiated a major construction project to build 14 public schools, two of which will be created using large-scale 3D printing technology. This effort, a collaboration between UCC Holding and Danish firm COBOD, is part of Qatar's National Vision 2030, which emphasizes innovation and sustainability. The schools' designs are inspired by desert dunes, featuring curved walls that are difficult and costly to produce with traditional methods. The project is notable for its massive scale and its potential to significantly reduce material waste, labor costs, and construction time, setting a new precedent for eco-friendly architecture.</p>

          <p>The San Diego-based rap group The Neighborhood Kids has gone viral with their song "Kids in Cages," an anthem of rage and defiance that has resonated widely amid recent federal immigration raids. The track, originally from 2023, gained new prominence after being shared by influential musicians like Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who called them his "new favorite band." The song's raw lyrics give voice to the anger and humanity of working-class immigrants who feel targeted and dehumanized. The group's sudden acclaim led to a performance at a "Defend L.A." benefit concert organized by Morello.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year, €2 trillion budget for the European Union, featuring a fivefold increase in funding for defense and space initiatives. The plan allocates €131 billion to a new European Competitiveness Fund, reflecting what Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calls Europe's "era of rearmament." The budget also prioritizes climate and biodiversity projects, which will receive 35% of the funds, and triples funding for migration management. The proposal, which must be unanimously approved by member states, aims to generate new revenue streams to avoid increasing national contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The largest known fragment of Mars on Earth, a meteorite weighing over 54 pounds, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction for nearly $5.3 million. The meteorite, designated NWA 16788, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth, and this single piece represents a significant portion of all known Martian material. Sotheby's described the object not just as a miraculous find but also as a massive dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>
