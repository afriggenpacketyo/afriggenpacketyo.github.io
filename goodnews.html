          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent scholar, argues that China must cultivate its own artificial intelligence knowledge system, distinct from Western intellectual frameworks. He highlights concerns about "intellectual colonialism," asserting that Western social science theories, while adopted by Chinese researchers, are inadequate for explaining Confucian, Islamic, and Indian civilizations. Yongnian stresses the importance of embracing China's unique secular civilization to properly define its role in the global order and build an AI paradigm that reflects its own practices and values. This strategic shift is crucial for fostering innovation that is culturally resonant and globally impactful.</p>

Elsewhere, the Cincinnati Bengals secured a 31-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but their win was overshadowed by a toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow in the first half. Other notable results included the Seattle Seahawks' win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions' dominant performance over the Chicago Bears, and the Buffalo Bills' comfortable victory against the New York Jets.

          <p>This article examines the urgent and varied strategies employed by communities in Louisiana and Alaska to adapt to accelerating coastal erosion, a direct consequence of climate change. Both regions face unique yet severe environmental challenges, including significant land loss and altered ecosystems, necessitating innovative local responses. The report draws insights from the "Sea Change" podcast, which documents the on-the-ground realities and community-driven efforts to bolster resilience against these escalating threats. The narrative underscores the critical need for proactive adaptation and sustainable solutions to safeguard vulnerable coastlines and the livelihoods dependent on them.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 16:31:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services are increasingly popular among consumers, offering attractive interest-free installment options that diverge from traditional credit cards. This surge in BNPL usage, projected to reach 91.5 million Americans by 2025, is creating significant unease among banks and credit card companies. Financial institutions view BNPL as a direct competitor, eroding their transaction revenue and making it challenging to assess consumer creditworthiness due to a lack of visibility into these loans. The rapid growth of BNPL represents a fundamental shift in consumer credit behavior and financial market dynamics, prompting caution from established lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly relocated from NYU's Manhattan campus to its Washington D.C. program, sparking speculation about his future involvement in politics.

While he was previously studying at NYU Stern School of Business, a shift towards a more politically oriented major is considered plausible given his past assistance with his father's campaigns.

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury's has announced the termination of its discussions with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com concerning the potential sale of its general merchandise arm, Argos. The decision came after JD.com presented "materially revised" terms and commitments that Sainsbury's determined were not aligned with the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the cessation of these high-profile talks, Sainsbury's reiterated its forecast to deliver an underlying retail operating profit of around £1 billion for the financial year 2025-2026. This development means Argos will not immediately benefit from JD.com's proposed expertise in retail, technology, and logistics. (not investment advice)</p>
