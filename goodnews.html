          <p>A Macau-based conglomerate, HN Group, is developing a luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai's Hengqin district, targeting affluent Hong Kong retirees. The Serensia Woods community aims to capitalize on the shortage of high-end retirement options in Hong Kong, offering a 133-room hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa. With Hong Kong's aging population, the project seeks to provide a professional care level absent in most at-home retirement situations. The development, costing 2 billion yuan (US$278.4 million), hopes to attract those who can afford average prices starting at HK$10 million, offering a compelling alternative to traditional retirement living.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is confronting the critical issue of sanitation during disasters, revealing that the nation is underprepared for maintaining toilet facilities when water and electricity are disrupted. Councilor Tsuyoshi Yamahana witnessed firsthand the unsanitary conditions at a train station after the quake, highlighting a problem that can lead to disease outbreaks and deter people from drinking enough water. Experts emphasize the need for better education on using portable toilets, as many residents are unfamiliar with them. Efforts are underway to teach elementary school students how to use these facilities to prevent future "toilet panic" and safeguard public health during emergencies, thus potentially saving lives in the long run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European startup scene is currently debating the merits of adopting China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, as some venture capitalists push for increased work hours to compete globally. However, many European founders and VCs are resisting this pressure, arguing that it glorifies overwork rather than smart work and clashes with European values and regulations. Critics contend that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through sustainable innovation cultures, not excessive work hours, and that aggressive funding and resources are more critical for the continent's startup ecosystem. There are also concerns that adopting such a culture could lead to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent, ultimately harming productivity and innovation.</p>

          <p>De Kai, an AI scientist, suggests that instead of viewing AI development as a competition, it should be approached as an "AI climate change challenge," which requires a paradigm shift where people "parent" AI systems. De Kai argues that since AI learns by absorbing online human interactions, it is crucial to be conscientious about the influences surrounding these systems. In his new book, *Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future*, De Kai emphasizes the importance of being good role models for AI, as the systems are essentially learning from us. This concern is not new to De Kai, who has been advocating for AI ethics for many years, including serving on Google's short-lived AI ethics council.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to introduce a new registration system designed to encourage citizens to maintain strong ties with rural areas facing depopulation, with a goal of enlisting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative is a key part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional areas and reverse the trend of people moving to major cities like Tokyo. The program involves a smartphone app where users can register with local governments, receiving information on local events and services, but it is unclear whether the program will offer more tangible benefits. The government also aims to promote living and working in multiple areas to encourage city dwellers to relocate to rural parts of the country, though some officials have criticized the plan as lacking novelty.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty secured victory over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes, held at Saratoga Springs due to renovations at Belmont Park, marking a repeat of their Kentucky Derby finish. Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, skipped the Preakness Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the Derby and Belmont without running in the Preakness since 1995. The race, shortened to 1 1/4 miles, saw Journalism finish second, with Baeza in third, mirroring the Derby results, and jockey Junior Alvarado celebrated his first Belmont Stakes win. The victory underscores Sovereignty's dominance and creates a notable rivalry with Journalism, who won the Preakness, setting the stage for potential future matchups. The win did not come without controversy, as Alvarado was fined for excessive use of the riding crop in the Derby.</p>

The writing system consists of geometric patterns used on sand, cloth, and bodies, conveying mathematical principles, cosmic references, and instructions on community life. Originally taught and maintained by women, Sona is being rediscovered through research and the knowledge of surviving community elders.

These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being a coach or critic. The expert emphasizes that academic strengths alone are insufficient without a sense of possibility and that parents should support their children's growth by exposing them to opportunities and allowing their own desires to drive them.

The pills are being tested on patients who had drug-resistant bacteria, showing promising signals that they could tackle the rising scourge of superbugs.
