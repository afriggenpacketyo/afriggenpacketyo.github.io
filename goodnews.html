          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain Marc Guehi will be leaving the club next year. The 25-year-old England defender has declined a new contract offer, signaling his intention to seek a new opportunity when his current deal expires at the end of the season. This development means Crystal Palace faces the decision of either selling Guehi during the January transfer window to receive a fee or allowing him to leave as a free agent next summer. Glasner acknowledged the player's decision as a normal part of professional football.</p>

          <p>Players from Spanish football clubs Oviedo and Espanyol conducted a brief on-field protest by refusing to play for the first 15 seconds of their match. The demonstration was a coordinated action to express discontent with La Liga's decision to schedule a regular season game between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) organized the symbolic protest, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league regarding the controversial move. This action highlights the growing tension between players and league officials over the international expansion of domestic competitions.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing a campaign for the U.S. congressional seat currently held by veteran lawmaker Nancy Pelosi, setting the stage for a significant political contest in San Francisco. While Pelosi has not officially announced her plans for the 2026 election, Wiener's move signals a challenge and raises questions about a generational shift in Democratic leadership. The race is further complicated by the candidacy of wealthy progressive Saikat Chakrabarti, a former campaign manager for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, ensuring a competitive and nationally watched primary.</p>

          <p>Johnathan Walton, a podcaster whose work was instrumental in the conviction of con artist Marianne Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence. Smyth was convicted in Northern Ireland of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000, but Walton, who was a victim himself and detailed her extensive history of scams in his podcast, believes the punishment is too lenient for a serial fraudster. He argues that the court was unable to consider her broader pattern of deceit, including impersonating celebrities, and fears she will continue to harm others upon her release.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani led the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with one of the most dominant postseason performances in baseball history. In the decisive Game 4 of the NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out 10 batters while allowing just two hits over six shutout innings. His extraordinary two-way effort secured a 5-1 victory and a series sweep for the Dodgers, earning him the NLCS MVP award. The Dodgers will now have the opportunity to become the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back World Series titles.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals promising results for the Galleri blood test, which can screen for more than 50 different types of cancer by detecting fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test successfully identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with over half of those detected at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, the test found cancers for which no routine screening programs currently exist, such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use.</p>

          <p>A weekend trip to a Butlin's holiday park inadvertently saved the life of 31-year-old Charlotte Morjaria from Newport, Wales. After suffering what she thought was a broken rib during a playful game, she went to the hospital for a check-up. A CT scan revealed no rib damage but discovered a large, previously undetected cancerous tumor on her kidney. Doctors were able to diagnose her with a rare form of kidney cancer at an early stage, and she underwent surgery to remove the kidney. Now cancer-free, she credits the accidental injury with leading to the timely and life-saving diagnosis.</p>
