          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea. The company is expected to benefit from the agreement, which will see South Korea invest heavily in key US industries, including shipbuilding. Hanwha Group, which recently acquired the Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, is positioned to play a major role in revitalizing American shipbuilding efforts. The stock's rise was also supported by a strong second-quarter operating profit and new order acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a trade agreement with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on its exports, a reduction from the initially threatened 25%. The deal reportedly includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S., but officials from both nations appear to have different understandings of the terms. While the White House claims 90% of the profits from this investment will go to Americans, South Korean officials suggest the funds are for reinvestment and to help their companies expand. The disagreement highlights the complex and contentious nature of the negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

Spirovski stated that she was recovering from the injury when she met Barton and that painting without a brush was almost painless. She expressed her gratitude to the public and to Barton for allowing her to paint him during a challenging period.</p>

The incident occurred on Wednesday evening, and officials confirmed that no other personnel were harmed. The crash sparked a small grass fire, which was quickly contained. The aircraft was part of the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" squadron, a unit responsible for training pilots to fly the advanced F-35 fighter.

          <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened its first permanent office in New Zealand, located at the US embassy in Wellington. FBI Director Kash Patel stated the new presence is an "historic moment" aimed at strengthening the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The office will also focus on combating cybercrime, ransomware operations, and the narcotics trade. This move signifies a strategic prioritization by the US to enhance law enforcement and security partnerships in the region, covering New Zealand, Antarctica, and several Pacific Island nations.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Bill Increasing Penalties for Soliciting Minors for Sex</h2>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill, AB 379, into law, which increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill faced opposition from some Democrats who were concerned that a related provision, criminalizing loitering to purchase sex, could be used to profile minorities. The final version represents a compromise, targeting older offenders while also establishing a support fund for survivors of sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. A source close to Harris indicated that while she considered the role, her heart wasn't in it, and this choice keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approached, several contending teams made significant trades to strengthen their bullpens. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired highly-coveted closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for two top prospects. In another major move, the New York Mets bolstered their relief corps by trading for both Ryan Helsley from the Cardinals and submariner Tyler Rogers from the Giants. The Cincinnati Reds also made a splash, acquiring Gold Glove third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes from the Pirates, signaling a heated market for impactful players before the deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a "full and complete trade deal" with South Korea, setting a 15% tariff on its imports just before a critical deadline. This rate is lower than the 25% levy that was previously threatened. The agreement also includes a $350 billion investment from Seoul into the US, with a significant portion dedicated to revitalizing the American shipbuilding industry. For its part, South Korea successfully protected its sensitive rice and beef markets from further US imports. The deal places South Korea on a similar footing to Japan, which recently secured a comparable tariff rate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to the UK government for the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The Arora Group's plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be cheaper, less risky, and could be fully operational by 2035, challenging the airport's own expansion plans. This marks the first time a rival bid has been formally considered for the long-debated project, introducing new competition into the process.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter results, beating Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue, which surged 45% year-over-year. The company's growth was driven by a significant increase in funded customers, a near doubling of total platform assets to $279 billion, and strong net interest revenue. While options trading revenue was robust, cryptocurrency and equities trading came in slightly below forecasts. The company is aggressively expanding into wealth management and retirement accounts, and teased the upcoming launch of a new banking product this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping. The scene caused initial concern, but the team confirmed the issue was not a serious injury, and Ohtani was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. The two-way phenom looked uncomfortable on the mound during a hot and humid night after throwing a season-high 51 pitches. Despite the scare, manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the injury was minor and expects Ohtani to make his next scheduled start.</p>
