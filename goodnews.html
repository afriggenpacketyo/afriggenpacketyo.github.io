          <p>China's Zhongman Petroleum has drilled 193 wells in Egypt's West Minya to irrigate a 500-hectare desert area, now home to the world's largest beet sugar factory. The project, part of China's efforts to export agricultural technology to emerging markets, is irrigating a farm that supplies Canal Sugar with an annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes. Zhongman used air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers and prevent well collapse, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This partnership reflects a strategic alignment, with Chinese companies seeking overseas opportunities and Middle Eastern countries looking to Chinese expertise for development challenges. The project highlights China's growing role in providing technological solutions for agricultural development in the Middle East.</p>

He aims to revise martial law legislation, revitalize small and medium-sized businesses, and strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance while improving ties with China and Russia. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, ahead of Kim Moon Soo of the conservative People Power Party, with voter turnout at 79.4%, the highest in 28 years.

          <p>President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform is moving towards launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) after NYSE Arca filed to list a bitcoin fund linked to Trump Media. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF aims to track the price of bitcoin, offering investors a simpler way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. This move follows a partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to introduce a range of digital asset products, pending regulatory approval. The ETF market has grown to over $130 billion in total assets since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. If approved, this ETF would represent one of the most politically connected entries into the growing market for bitcoin funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S., following a national outcry. Deysi Vargas, her husband, and their daughter, Sofia, came to the U.S. in 2023 for Sofia's specialized medical care. The government had previously ended their humanitarian parole and ordered them to self-deport, prompting warnings from Sofia's doctors that she would likely die if forced to return to Mexico. The reversal came after significant pressure from Democratic lawmakers and public outrage, with the administration granting the family humanitarian parole for one year. This decision allows Sofia to continue her treatment, highlighting the importance of humanitarian aid in critical medical situations.</p>

The legislation, now heading to the California State Assembly, aims to address concerns raised by parents about the potential harm virtual characters can inflict on children‚Äôs mental health. Under Senate Bill 243, operators of companion chatbot platforms would be required to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters aren‚Äôt human. Platforms would also need to implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation, suicide, or self-harm expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources. The bill defines companion chatbots as AI systems capable of meeting the social needs of users, excluding customer service chatbots.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo in 2018 due to a toxic sales culture that led to a fake accounts scandal. The bank can now grow without the asset restrictions that have been in place.

The removal of the asset cap allows Wells Fargo to pursue higher deposits, new accounts, and additional investment banking businesses.

          <p>The UK has been temporarily spared from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The exemption is linked to the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May, which aims to eliminate these tariffs, though it has yet to come into force. Trump indicated that the US might increase the tariff on the UK "on or after July 9 2025" if it "determines that the United Kingdom has not complied with relevant aspects of the EPD." The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs and will work with the US to implement the agreement.</p>

The popular sandwich, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was removed in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a departure from the original version's grilled or fried chicken options. The company has launched a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing fan content and petitions for the Snack Wrap's return.

          <p>A four-year-old Mexican girl receiving lifesaving medical care in Southern California has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the country. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother permission for one year so she can continue treatment she has been getting since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023. The decision reverses an earlier notification that their humanitarian parole was being revoked and they would be subject to potential deportation. The girl receives intravenous nutrition for short bowel syndrome, a treatment unavailable in Mexico, and the humanitarian parole does not put migrants on a path to U.S. citizenship.</p>
