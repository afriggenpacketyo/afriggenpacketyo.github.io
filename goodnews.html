          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino declared the revamped Club World Cup a major financial success, reporting over $2 billion in revenue. The tournament's final, which saw Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain, highlighted the financial benefits for top clubs, with FIFA also promising a solidarity payment to clubs worldwide. However, the event faced criticism from figures like Jürgen Klopp over player exhaustion, which was intensified by extreme heat during matches. The tournament also underscored the growing relationship between Infantino and former President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup title with a decisive victory against Paris Saint-Germain. Attacking midfielder Cole Palmer was the star, scoring two nearly identical goals and assisting a third before halftime. Despite PSG's efforts in the second half, they were unable to overcome the early deficit created by Chelsea's clinical and well-executed game plan. The match concluded with a red card for PSG's João Neves after a scuffle on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots with a raw and improvisational feel. The album follows a period of personal and professional change for the artist and features a murky, chillwave-inspired production style. Collaborators include modern pop innovators like Mk.gee, and the lyrics touch on the challenges of his marriage and public life with frankness. The article positions the album as an authentic, if sometimes messy, reflection of Bieber's current state of mind.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to significantly increase France's defense budget, citing unprecedented threats to freedom since 1945. The annual defense spending is now projected to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal originally set for 2030 and double the amount from when he first took office. Macron attributed the need for a more powerful military to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and "uncertainty" from the United States. The move aims to ensure France is "feared" and therefore "free" in a more dangerous world. (not investment advice)</p>

While the domestic debut was the third-largest of 2025, international ticket sales were comparatively lower, totaling $95 million.</p>

The story, shared on Reddit, prompted numerous responses from others who shared similar experiences with homebuyer's remorse. Many commenters advised the couple to accept the financial loss for the sake of their happiness and emphasized the value of renting in a new city before buying.</p>

Graham described the legislation as a "sledgehammer" that would give President Trump the authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil for aiding Russia's war effort. The push comes as Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and considers sending more defensive weapons to Ukraine. The bill reportedly has broad support and could be considered in the Senate soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a unique, privately funded art gallery called the Cookie Factory.

The mission of the space is to provide a place for community gathering and healing through art. The gallery's inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September before rotating to a new artist.</p>
