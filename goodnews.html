        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has been issued a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The penalty was imposed because he failed to slow down sufficiently under double yellow flags before the Dutch Grand Prix. This decision compounds a difficult weekend for the Ferrari team, as both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crashed out of the race in Zandvoort. The penalty means Hamilton will start no higher than sixth in his first race at Monza as a Ferrari driver.</p>

Will Jacks was instrumental in the victory, scoring a record 72 runs from 41 balls to help his team post a total of 168-5. In response, the Trent Rockets struggled against the Invincibles' bowling, particularly leg-spinner Nathan Sowter who took three key wickets. Despite a late effort from Marcus Stoinis, the Rockets finished short at 142-8.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for departure, following a lawsuit from attorneys who argued the move would violate the children's legal protections. The judge's temporary restraining order, which lasts for 14 days, requires the children to be returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration had argued it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's advocates.</p>

          <p>A new tropical storm, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, located over a thousand miles from the coast of Mexico. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm poses no immediate threat to land but is expected to intensify.

Its maximum sustained winds were recorded at 40 mph, making it the 11th named storm of the season in the Eastern North Pacific.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris acknowledged that his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix due to an oil leak is a significant blow to his Formula 1 world championship aspirations. The retirement caused him to fall 34 points behind his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who won the race. Despite the setback, Norris stated he now feels less pressure and will "go for it" in the remaining nine races of the season. The incident at Zandvoort was a frustrating turn after a strong series of results before the summer break.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. Ramsay shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is rarely life-threatening, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to advocate for public safety.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that Europe is developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of a post-conflict security guarantee. In an interview, she mentioned that the deployment could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops and would be backed by U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems. Von der Leyen also noted that President Trump has provided reassurance of an American presence as part of this security backstop. Further high-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion deal to provide the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export agreement by value. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates. The agreement was seen as a major victory for the UK's defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the U.S.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new approaches to bolster support for Ukraine, including the possibility of secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners. Other ideas discussed were establishing "safe haven" arms production for Ukraine on EU soil and finding new ways to utilize frozen Russian assets to aid Kyiv. Ministers also considered shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian territory in the event of a ceasefire. The discussions reflect a search for more impactful ways to assist Ukraine as the conflict with Russia continues.</p>

          <h2>California Kelp Forest Revived Through Large-Scale Sea Urchin Removal Project</h2>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a non-profit called The Bay Foundation has led an effort to clear over 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by smashing nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins. This has allowed the giant Pacific kelp, which had declined by 80%, to regrow, restoring critical habitat for hundreds of marine species. The article details a successful method for combating ecosystem collapse caused by species imbalance.</p>
