          <p>Former President Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, a week after hinting at a deal with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keen to learn more about the specifics of the agreement, which Trump has described as a "partnership" that will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a significant investment from Nippon. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick suggested the U.S. government would retain a "golden share" to ensure American control and production levels. The agreement follows a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), signaling a potential softening of previous opposition to the deal. The potential agreement aims to mitigate any national security risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concluded. Trump praised Musk as a great business leader and innovator who dedicated his talents to the nation's service. While DOGE fell short of its initial $1 trillion cost-cutting goal, the White House claims it saved approximately $170 billion. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence that the $1 trillion goal would be achieved over time, while Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved as a friend and advisor. Despite recent disagreements over Trump's domestic policy, the president affirmed his commitment to making DOGE's cuts permanent and seeking congressional codification.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in *The New York Times* explores a potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing rates of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of harm, abuse, neglect, and trauma has led to an impossible standard for parenting. This has resulted in adult children cutting off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles, and a fear of not meeting these heightened expectations. The piece posits that this cultural shift contributes to a dread of parenthood, as individuals fear replicating perceived parental shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his time as the public face of DOGE, estimating $175 billion in government cost-cutting. Savings included slashing government contracts, selling assets, and identifying improper payments. Trump highlighted specific cuts, such as funding for Arab Sesame Street and transgender mice research. While some outlets dispute DOGE's estimates, Musk is confident that the savings will reach $1 trillion in the coming years. Musk noted the difficulty in cutting expenses due to complaints from those receiving the money. The team expects cuts to soon hit the $200 billion threshold for fiscal year 25-26.</p>
