          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite missing Mookie Betts, the team continued its recent trend of higher run production, with key contributions from Teoscar Hernández and Andy Pages. Hernández hit a crucial two-run homer, while Pages added a double and a sacrifice fly. The win, backed by a solid pitching performance, marks the Dodgers' third victory in their last four games as the trade deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on stricter U.S. visa policies and academic funding cuts to recruit top scientific and engineering talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who might have otherwise remained in the United States. This influx of brainpower is intended to fuel the sector's growth and enhance its use of artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a strategic shift as China's quant fund market, now the world's second-largest, continues its rapid expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Robotaxi Service Must Include Human Drivers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:18:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California state regulators have stated that Tesla is not authorized to operate a public autonomous vehicle service without a human driver in control. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hinted at expanding the company's robotaxi service, the California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows for a charter-party carrier service with human drivers. This distinction means any "friends and family" service launched in the state must be more of a traditional taxi service than a fully autonomous one. The clarification comes as Tesla also faces a DMV hearing over its marketing of "Full Self-Driving" features.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players skipped the MLS All-Star game, which is a violation of league rules. Mas described the punishment as "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why missing an exhibition match would lead to a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stood by the long-standing policy, while also indicating the rule may be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>A salon owner from Leicester, Rebecca Dowdeswell, is preparing for a crucial hearing with the Intellectual Property Office in her ongoing trademark dispute with the cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when L'Oréal opposed her attempt to re-register the trademark for her salon, "nkd," arguing it would cause confusion with its "Naked" line of products. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, maintains there has been no consumer confusion in 15 years of business. She states she is ready to continue her fight against the corporate giant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including butterflies, ladybirds, and wasps. The Royal Horticultural Society noted a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, which thrive in warm, dry conditions. While this has been a visibly bumper year for some insects, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This short-term boom contrasts with long-term research suggesting a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents unlawfully thwarted federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, affirming that the city's welcoming ordinance is lawful and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs.</p>

          <p>An article explores Donald Trump's unique relationship with golf, portraying it as more than just a presidential pastime but a core part of his business and political identity. For Trump, the sport serves as a venue for fierce competition, high-level networking, and deal-making, distinct from the leisurely approach of past presidents. He has used his golf courses to forge connections with world leaders like Shinzo Abe and political allies, often in private settings away from media scrutiny. The article notes that a tee time with Trump is a coveted, transactional opportunity for those seeking influence.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Texas's dwindling bighorn sheep population, wildlife biologists have successfully relocated a group of the animals to a new, isolated mountain range. The state's native bighorn population has been decimated by disease, losing about 50% in the last five years. The rescue mission involved capturing dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd and airlifting them to the Franklin Mountains. A recent follow-up confirmed the relocated sheep have survived and even produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery in the state.</p>

          <p>This article explores the necessity of strictly adhering to popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts suggest there is often more flexibility than commonly believed; for instance, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy people. However, they caution against dismissing all guidelines, noting that consistent sleep of at least seven hours is strongly linked to long-term health. The consensus is that while benchmarks are useful, a balanced, less rigid approach to incorporating healthy habits is often more sustainable and effective.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, moving beyond treating female athletes as "mini-men" to researching their unique physiology. Scientists are studying how factors like breast biomechanics, the menstrual cycle, and anatomical differences affect performance and injury risk. Research shows that proper sports bras can significantly improve performance by reducing inefficient movement, while a greater understanding of the menstrual cycle can help athletes manage symptoms. This new focus aims to optimize performance, reduce injuries like ACL tears, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

          <p>Despite long-standing criticism, some sociologists and communication experts are beginning to argue that reality television can have positive societal effects. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, potentially giving viewers insight into different social landscapes and fostering greater understanding. Shows like "Big Brother" and "Love Island" have sparked national conversations on topics from disability awareness to gaslighting and domestic abuse. While the welfare of contestants remains a serious concern, some research suggests these programs can be a powerful driver of social outcomes and conversations.</p>
