          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have been steadily decreasing, reaching their lowest point since 2023, averaging 7.95%. The article explores the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on HELOC rates. While a rate cut is not expected this week, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding future rate cuts could influence HELOC rates. The article suggests that borrowers monitor the rate climate, as HELOC rates adjust monthly, offering potential cost savings even without immediate Fed action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop despite exceeding revenue expectations and raising its revenue guidance for the year. Analysts cited concerns regarding modest full-year revenue guidance, sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. The company reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, with a 39% revenue increase from the previous year. CEO Alex Karp expressed optimism, stating Palantir is "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to fall back to Earth, posing a small risk of impact. Experts estimate the half-ton object, originally intended to land on Venus, will reenter the atmosphere around May 10th. While most of the spacecraft disintegrated years ago, the landing capsule may survive reentry, potentially creating a falling metal object. The article notes that the risk of being hit is low but not impossible, and the event highlights growing concerns about space debris impacting Earth.</p>
