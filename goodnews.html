          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting departments such as Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. While the budget proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, Republican senators have criticized the proposal, claiming it leaves military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms. The White House defends the cuts, stating they would lead to significant savings while protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure. Senate Democrats have also criticized the budget, expressing alarm that the request could severely slash programs many Americans rely on.</p>

A recent study published in Scientific Reports focused on percussion beats in a laboratory, with Ronan bobbing her head to different tempos. Researchers found that Ronan outperformed college students in keeping a beat, showcasing her lifetime learning and flexibility in recognizing new rhythms. This research challenges the long-held belief that the ability to respond to music is distinctly human.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections, challenging the dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. The party has secured overall control of seven councils and won a by-election, tapping into widespread voter dissatisfaction. Projections indicate that Reform UK garnered 30% of the vote, surpassing the peak popularity of UKIP in 2013. In contrast, both the Conservatives and Labour experienced losses, while the Liberal Democrats and Greens showed resilience. These results suggest a potential shift in British politics, possibly ending the joint dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has enlisted a team of conservative-aligned lawyers, including former clerks to Supreme Court justices and an ex-adviser to the Trump Organization, to fight a lawsuit against the Trump administration. This strategic move contrasts with Harvard's previous legal battles, where it relied on firms traditionally associated with the university. The university's decision to hire conservative lawyers aims to signal the importance of academic freedom and potentially gain favor in a court with a Republican-appointed supermajority. The case argues that the Trump administration's orders violate the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, worth approximately $4.8 billion, according to a recent financial filing. This decision follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded expectations but provided a cautious outlook for the current quarter due to potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs. Bezos has previously used Amazon share sales to fund his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and philanthropic endeavors. This marks his first sale of company stock since 2021, and he has been spending more time on Blue Origin and his climate fund since stepping down as CEO.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, slightly above expectations, despite concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%. The report comes amid an uncertain climate in which Trump kicked off April by slapping "liberation day" 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports, and threatened a menu of other "reciprocal" duties on dozens of other nations. Health care and transportation led job creation, while the federal government reported a loss of jobs. Wage growth was slightly below expectations, and analysts suggest the full impact of the tariffs may not be evident until later reports.</p>

          <p>The remedies trial in the U.S. government's antitrust case against Google regarding its advertising technology is scheduled to begin on Sept. 22. This follows a ruling that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets by tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange together. The judge previously ruled that Google has held a monopoly in its core market of internet search. Google is also navigating increasing competition in the generative AI market while defending itself from antitrust allegations.</p>
