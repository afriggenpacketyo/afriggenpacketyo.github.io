          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the discussions as productive, with expectations of a joint statement detailing the agreements. These talks represent the first face-to-face meetings since significant tariffs were imposed by both countries, causing market turmoil and recession fears. While some experts anticipate tariff cuts, others remain cautious, predicting a commitment to continued dialogue rather than immediate resolution of all trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Britain is significantly increasing its defense budget, aiming to revitalize local economies and create jobs, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model. BAE Systems, a major defense contractor, is expanding its operations in Barrow, spurred by increased military spending, which is driving local business growth. The government plans to invest ¬£200 million in Barrow to improve infrastructure, education, and healthcare, making the town more attractive to workers and families. This initiative seeks to distribute the benefits of higher military spending across the country, rather than concentrating it in wealthier regions, with the goal of fostering sustainable economic development.</p>

Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen held captive in Gaza. This move is seen as an encouraging step toward resuming negotiations and addressing the growing frustration with the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections amidst a growing feud between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte.

The results will significantly impact the impeachment trial of Duterte and Marcos's political agenda for the 2028 presidential election.

Brexit aimed to grant the government greater control over immigration, but net migration figures have continued to rise. The latest data is expected to show a decline in 2024 due to a decrease in visas granted, highlighting the ongoing complexities of managing immigration in the UK.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial showed that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks, compared to 14% with Wegovy. Researchers suggest that both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be better for those needing to lose more weight. The drugs work by mimicking hormones that reduce appetite, but Mounjaro mimics two hormones compared to Wegovy's one.</p>
