          <p>Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel secured a victory in the second stage of the Tour de France, narrowly defeating Tadej Pogacar in a dramatic sprint finish. The win, on the 209.1km route to Boulogne-sur-Mer, also earned van der Poel the coveted yellow jersey as the overall race leader. The stage remained relatively calm until the final 40km, when a series of attacks on punchy climbs created a separation in the peloton. Van der Poel, a pre-stage favorite, capitalized in the thrilling finale to claim his second career stage win at the prestigious event.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a failure in the tournament's new electronic line-calling system. The technology failed to make a call on a crucial point, and after a delay, the umpire ordered the point to be replayed, a decision Pavlyuchenkova claimed "stole" the game from her. An All England Club spokesperson later attributed the malfunction to operator error. Despite the controversy and frustration, Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match, but the incident has raised questions about the reliability of the automated system.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm is moving north and is expected to continue to weaken and dissipate over the next day. All tropical storm warnings have been discontinued, though scattered showers, heavy rain, and potential flash flooding remain a risk for parts of North and South Carolina. Flood watches are still in effect for some inland areas, but the storm's most significant threat appears to have passed.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett vigorously defended the administration's newly signed domestic policy bill. He asserted that economic modeling predicts the legislation will spur 3% growth, which would generate enough revenue to shrink the deficit, contrary to projections from the CBO and other groups. Hassett also discussed ongoing trade negotiations, suggesting deals are imminent while letters are being sent to other nations ahead of a tariff deadline. He dismissed concerns that millions would lose Medicaid, arguing the bill's work requirements will lead to more job-based insurance coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explores Twain's journey from a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, to a global literary icon whose sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a fear of poverty. Chernow suggests that Twain's writings on politics, class, and race remain strikingly relevant today. The piece reflects on how Twain, through works like "Huckleberry Finn," both embodied and critiqued the American character, securing his place as a vital voice in the nation's history.</p>
