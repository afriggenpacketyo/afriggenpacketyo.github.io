          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop after Warren Buffett announced his plan to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel slated to take over in 2026. The announcement, made at Berkshire's annual meeting, marks the end of Buffett's 60-year tenure. While shareholders expressed confidence in the transition and Buffett's continued role as chairman, the news led to a decrease in both Class A and Class B shares. This transition marks a significant moment for the conglomerate, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a diversified juggernaut.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the declining power of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to sway voters in Australia. Despite consistently supporting the Coalition and campaigning against Labor and other opponents, News Corp's impact on election outcomes has been negligible since 2010. The rise of diverse media platforms and the increasing importance of trust and objectivity in journalism have contributed to the waning influence of News Corp's opinionated outlets. The article suggests that progressives should focus on writing their own agenda and engaging with the world as it is, rather than reacting to News Corp's excesses.</p>

          <p>After numerous extensions, the REAL ID deadline is finally here. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005 in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, aims to establish secure identification standards for air travel and federal facilities. While intended to enhance security, the law has faced opposition due to privacy concerns and practical challenges. As the deadline approaches, states have worked to implement the requirements, but questions remain about the impact on individuals who choose not to obtain a REAL ID.</p>
