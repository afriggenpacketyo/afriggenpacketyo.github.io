          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, marking his first visit to China in seven years. The meeting occurs amid strained relations following deadly border clashes in 2020 and deep-seated suspicion, yet both nations face economic pressures from U.S. tariffs that could push them toward reluctant cooperation. While experts don't foresee a long-lasting friendship, the talks signal a willingness to find common ground, driven by India's heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains for key industries like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles. China, facing a domestic slowdown, also stands to benefit from greater access to the Indian market.</p>

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a former NASA scientist, has emerged as a key figure in China's semiconductor industry through her company, Innoscience. Founded in 2015, the company specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a material crucial for efficient power electronics. In a significant development, Innoscience was recently named a supplier for Nvidia's advanced power architecture for AI data centers, a notable inclusion amid U.S.-China tech decoupling. Under Luo's leadership, Innoscience became the first in the world to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, giving China a competitive edge in third-generation semiconductor technology.</p>

The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year. Gross merchandise volume also grew significantly by 43% to $10.4 billion, and Affirm achieved operating income profitability for the quarter. The positive results come amid a competitive landscape, highlighted by Walmart's recent shift to rival Klarna, but also a new partnership with Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of ancient English oak trees, such as the 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire, to understand their remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other threats. The project, led by charities The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to identify specific genes responsible for their longevity. This genetic information could be vital for selecting the most robust saplings for future planting, helping to restore Britain's depleted woodlands. Ancient oaks are crucial ecological keystones, supporting over 2,300 species and playing a central role in nature recovery efforts across the UK.</p>

          <p>For 42 of its 75 years on the air, host Bev Johnson has been a cornerstone of WDIA in Memphis, America's first all-Black radio station. Since its pivot to Black-focused programming in 1948, WDIA has served as a vital source of music, news, and community information that was often ignored by mainstream media, including stories on civil rights and police brutality. The station played a key role in preserving the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, which is now the National Civil Rights Museum. Johnson continues this legacy, providing listeners with critical information and a connection to their community.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, aged 45, secured her first women's doubles victory at the US Open since 2014, teaming up with 22-year-old Canadian Leylah Fernandez. The pair defeated the sixth-seeded duo of Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez 7-6 (4), 6-3 in a thrilling first-round match. Despite her 14 major doubles titles with her sister Serena, Williams claims she is not a comfortable doubles player, but their on-court chemistry and determination impressed the supportive crowd. After the match, Williams praised Fernandez as the best partner she's had outside of Serena, noting their similar focused mentality on the court.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the NHS will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales, a move aimed at preventing severe illness and reducing the economic burden on working parents. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will dramatically reduce cases of the highly contagious varicella virus, which, though usually mild, can lead to serious complications like encephalitis and stroke.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to strong, albeit varied, reviews, with some critics hailing it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the Noah Baumbach-directed film, Clooney plays an aging, hugely successful movie star grappling with the personal sacrifices made for his career, a role that draws parallels to his own life. The film co-stars Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, and Billy Crudup and explores themes of identity, fame, and the gap between public personas and private selves. Clooney's subtle and reflective performance is already generating awards season buzz in a competitive year for lead actors.</p>
