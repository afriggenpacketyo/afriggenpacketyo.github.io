          <p>Investment research firm Morningstar, in partnership with PitchBook, has launched the 'Modern Market 100,' the first benchmark index to combine public and private equities. The index tracks 90 of the largest U.S. public companies and 10 major venture-backed private firms like SpaceX and OpenAI. This innovation reflects the growing trend of high-growth companies staying private longer, making it difficult for typical investors to gain exposure. The new index aims to provide a more comprehensive view of the modern economy and has shown a 1-year return of 28.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's 20% gain over the same period.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales, has stated that the police practice of recording 'non-crime hate incidents' is 'no longer required' and should be scrapped. He argued that intelligence on potential escalations of hate can be gathered in other ways that cause less public concern and allow for more open speech. These incidents are recorded when an act is perceived as motivated by prejudice but does not meet the threshold of a criminal offense. The comments come amid a wider debate on policing online speech and free expression in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling that she has shown a strong likelihood of success in her lawsuit. The judge, Jia Cobb, stated that the 'for cause' provision for removing a governor likely pertains only to conduct during their time in office, not prior actions. Trump sought to remove Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud that predated her appointment to the Fed board. This decision marks a significant moment in the unprecedented legal battle over the independence of the central bank from political interference.</p>

Legendary band Pulp received a nomination for their first album in 24 years, while Wolf Alice set a record with their fourth nomination for their fourth consecutive album. At 84, folk musician Martin Carthy becomes the oldest nominee ever, and pop artist PinkPantheress is recognized for her short, viral mixtape. This year's list is notably less London-centric, with the awards ceremony set to be held in Newcastle for the first time.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Removing the £100 Limit on Contactless Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:24:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks to remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. This would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap, and reflects the declining use of PINs. While the move could streamline larger purchases like a full grocery shop, it has raised concerns about fraud. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for any fraudulent transactions and would need to ensure their systems can identify low-risk payments, while also giving customers the option to set their own limits.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are advising not to be deceived by the current quiet in the Atlantic, as the hurricane season has now reached its climatological peak on September 10th. Historically, the period between mid-August and mid-October accounts for the majority of tropical storm activity. Forecasters expect conditions to become more favorable for storm development later this month, citing very warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf and Caribbean which provide ample fuel. So far, the 2025 season has seen six named storms, with experts at NOAA still predicting an above-normal season with 13 to 18 total named storms.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill aimed at fostering artificial intelligence innovation by reducing regulatory hurdles for companies. The proposal would require the federal government to establish a 'regulatory sandbox,' a secure testing environment where AI developers could apply for temporary waivers from existing regulations that impede their work. This initiative reflects a concern among some lawmakers that stringent rules could cause the U.S. to fall behind global competitors like China in the AI race. The plan aims to balance accelerated development with protections for safety and privacy, positioning AI as a key priority for the Senate Commerce Committee.</p>

Several candidates have announced their intention to run, including Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who is seen as a frontrunner, and left-wing MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy. Other contenders like Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry are also vying for the position, which will be decided by a vote of party members in October.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request for an expedited hearing on the legality of many of the president's tariffs. The case consolidates two lower court rulings that found Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing wide-ranging 'reciprocal tariffs' and other duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration argued for a swift review, warning that a delayed decision could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs. The court will hear oral arguments in November, signaling a potentially rapid resolution to the major legal challenge against the president's trade policies.</p>

This 'third hand' can perform routine tasks such as retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, freeing up the surgeon to focus on more complex actions with the two primary robotic arms. Published in the journal Science Robotics, the innovation aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons caused by a growing clinical demand, particularly from an aging population.

          <p>An exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of the urban landscape in the former East Germany (GDR). Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to a post-war housing crisis, these buildings became symbols of social change and, after reunification, sites of economic hardship and rising extremism. The exhibition, 'Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau,' uses art to revisit the collective memory associated with these structures, examining themes of community, belonging, and the painful transformation that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
