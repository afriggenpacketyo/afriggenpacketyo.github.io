          <p>Local restoration artist Sheila Lehman is meticulously repairing the iconic, seven-foot-tall Bob's Big Boy statues at the oldest remaining location in Burbank, California. Working by hand, she has refurbished the figures, which had suffered significant damage, including a smashed head on the rooftop statue. Lehman, who has personal memories of the restaurant from her youth, began her restoration career by fixing a statue for her church. She now brings her passion to family heirlooms sent from across the country, finding joy in preserving cherished pieces of history.</p>

          <p>This article offers a behind-the-scenes look at the environment that supported the England Lionesses during their Euro 2025 victory. The Football Association created a "home away from home" at a five-star hotel in Zurich, complete with a team barista and his dog, Reggie. Players engaged in various hobbies to stay relaxed, including building Lego, playing the piano, and photography, fostering strong camaraderie. The supportive atmosphere, which also involved close engagement with family members, is credited with helping the team remain calm and focused throughout the tournament.</p>

          <p>A study by Swiss researchers found that the human immune system can be activated simply by viewing images of sick people. Using virtual reality, participants were shown avatars, some of which appeared to have rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response, specifically increasing the activity of innate lymphoid cells. Researchers suggest this finding could open therapeutic opportunities, such as using VR to modulate immunity for allergies or to boost vaccine effectiveness.</p>

The analysis suggests the market's reaction to Eaton's role in LNG applications may be overblown. The cash raised from the sale will be used to invest in other industrial stocks, like Honeywell and Dover, which are seen as having more room to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

The number of births in 2024 was half that of 2016, with young couples often citing high costs and career pressures as deterrents.
