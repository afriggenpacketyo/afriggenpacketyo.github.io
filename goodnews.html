          <p>This article analyzes the strategic importance of Son Heung-min's transfer to LAFC, positioning the move as a crucial step in building the club's international brand. It compares his potential marketing and community impact to that of Carlos Vela for the Hispanic community and Shohei Ohtani for the Japanese community in Los Angeles. Beyond his global appeal, Son is expected to be a dominant on-field performer, making the record transfer fee a calculated investment in both talent and global relevance for the MLS franchise.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, anticipates a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will secure their first-choice university places this year, even with near-miss grades. This trend is driven by universities seeking financial stability from three-year undergraduate enrollments amid uncertainty surrounding international student numbers. The context for this development includes a recent rise in tuition fees, which was implemented to help bolster university finances across the country.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption, along with other settlers, returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence suggests a precarious, informal settlement existed among the rubble until at least the 5th century, with people inhabiting the upper floors of still-buried homes. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the city was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event, revealing a forgotten chapter of its history and human resilience.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has stepped down from his position just before the finalization of Skydance Media's takeover. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its new leadership team for the studio. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible" during a particularly tumultuous period of business pressures and ownership uncertainty for the company.</p>

It emphasizes that these accounts have variable interest rates, meaning the actual interest earned will fluctuate over time, likely decreasing if the central bank eventually cuts its benchmark rate. The piece positions these accounts as a flexible option for savers wanting to earn high returns without the restrictions of a CD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. While current rates are similar, the piece concludes that a CD is the preferable option for maximizing guaranteed returns, as its interest rate is fixed for the entire term. In contrast, money market account rates are variable and likely to decrease with anticipated central bank rate cuts, which would widen the earnings gap over time. (not investment advice)</p>
