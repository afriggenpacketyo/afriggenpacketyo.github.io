          <p>In this New York Times guest article, Roger Lowenstein contemplates Warren Buffett's upcoming retirement as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, highlighting his unparalleled investment acumen and character. Buffett's consistency and long-term focus in an age of insecurity set him apart from Wall Street's frequent chicanery. He revered capitalism's institutions and treated shareholders' duty as a sacred trust, earning him comparisons to J.P. Morgan Sr. for his integrity. The article emphasizes Buffett's ability to look past short-term distractions and engage within his circle of competence, making him an irreplaceable figure in American capitalism. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by allegedly using his campaign website to signal strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as 'red-boxing,' involves publicly posting instructions that independent expenditure groups can then act upon, effectively coordinating strategy while circumventing direct communication prohibitions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and a Cuomo opponent has requested an investigation. Cuomo's campaign denies any wrongdoing, asserting that no independent expenditure acted on the information provided on the website.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced a restructuring as a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the nonprofit controlling it maintains its grip on the company. This decision is a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who worried about the company's profit focus overshadowing safety. The move comes amid scrutiny from attorneys general and experts concerned about the direction of AI development. As a public benefit corporation, OpenAI aims to balance profit with public and social good, with the nonprofit remaining its largest shareholder and selecting board members.</p>

          <p>A skull discovered at the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Hungary may belong to Matthias Corvinus, a legendary king of Hungary and Croatia, according to facial reconstruction specialist Emese G√°bor. G√°bor found a high degree of morphological similarity between the unknown skull and the skull of Corvinus' son, J√°nos Corvinus. The skull also has greenish discoloration, likely from a metal crown, and physical features that match what is known about Corvinus. Researchers plan further studies, including DNA analyses, to learn more about the skull's origin.</p>
