          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant shift in US policy. Trump announced the lifting of US sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the nation "a chance at greatness." Al-Sharaa, who previously led an al-Qaeda-linked rebel group, now heads a government seeking to rebuild ties with the West. Trump urged al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel, remove foreign terrorists, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers. Despite al-Sharaa's controversial past, the Trump administration hopes the new Syrian government can curb Iranian influence in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the adoption of the decision by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, aims to address State Farm's financial distress after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. Administrative Judge Karl Seligman found evidence of "extraordinary financial distress" for the company. State Senator Sasha Ren√©e P√©rez criticized the decision, citing hardships faced by fire victims. Lara assured residents that he considered all options and is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly, while also acknowledging the statewide insurance crisis.</p>

          <p>Justin Baldoni's legal team has made new claims that Blake Lively threatened Taylor Swift to gain support in her legal battle against Baldoni. Baldoni's lawyers allege Lively asked Swift to delete text messages and insinuated that private messages of a personal nature in Lively's possession would be released if Swift didn't publicly support her. Lively's lawyer has denied these claims as "categorically false." Swift was subpoenaed as a witness, but her spokesperson denied any significant connection to the film "It Ends With Us" beyond licensing a song. The legal conflict between Lively and Baldoni, involving accusations of sexual harassment and defamation, is scheduled to go to trial in March 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, dropping by nearly 30,000, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC credited President Trump's 2017 declaration of a public health emergency for the improvement. However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing drug addiction. Experts caution that these cuts could undermine the progress made, particularly as addiction is a complex issue requiring comprehensive care and support beyond emergency responses and treatment. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, emphasizing the need for continued investment in prevention and treatment.</p>

Despite the positive results, the stock initially declined in extended trading, partly due to investor uncertainty about the company's metrics. CEO Mike Intrator emphasized the increasing demand from diverse clients and the company's efforts to diversify its business.</p>

          <p>A series of bird deaths in a Northern California neighborhood, initially attributed to electrocution and described as "exploding," has been solved. Residents reported the incidents, blaming a local utility company. However, an investigation by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the Department of Fish and Wildlife found that the birds were not electrocuted. The birds showed injuries consistent with trauma, possibly caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. The investigation into the cause of the bird deaths is ongoing.</p>
