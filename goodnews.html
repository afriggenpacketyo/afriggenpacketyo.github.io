          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing it to lower crude oil and chemical prices, although this was partially offset by increased trading volumes. The state-owned oil giant posted an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, slightly ahead of analyst expectations. Despite the revenue dip, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, projecting that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day in the second half of 2025. The company is also set to boost its output as OPEC+ partners unwind voluntary production cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific research is exploring the connection between psychological stress and the aging process at a molecular level, finding that stress can induce changes in DNA similar to those seen in natural aging. A new hypothesis suggests that so-called 'zombie-like cells' could be a key mechanism through which the brain manages the effects of aging and stress. This area of study aims to better understand how mental states impact physical health and longevity. The article discusses the potential for future scientific interventions based on these emerging insights into the mind-body connection.</p>

          <h2>England's Ashes Hopes in Australia Seen as Heavily Reliant on Ben Stokes</h2>

          <p>An analysis of England's cricket team suggests that their chances of winning the upcoming Ashes series in Australia depend almost entirely on the performance and fitness of captain Ben Stokes. England has not won a Test series in Australia since 2011, and the current squad lacks experience and success on Australian soil. The article posits that Stokes will need to deliver a miraculous, all-around performance to overcome a strong Australian bowling attack. While England's batting lineup shows promise, the team's success is framed as a monumental challenge resting on their captain's shoulders.</p>

          <p>Countries are meeting in Geneva to resume negotiations for a legally binding global treaty to combat the plastic pollution crisis, after failing to reach an agreement in the initial two-year timeframe. A major point of contention divides the nearly 100 nations calling for ambitious production caps on single-use plastics and a group of oil-producing countries, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, that want the focus to remain on recycling. With plastic production continuing to grow exponentially, the talks aim to establish universal rules on plastic design, chemical use, and financing for waste management.</p>

          <p>China's government has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry and encourage consumption of local beef, as the sector faces falling prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system to promote high-quality Chinese beef. This initiative is part of a wider strategy to bolster key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted an injunction, ruling that the ban cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections. This legal setback forces Customs and Border Protection to revert to processing migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the administration's more restrictive emergency proclamation. The ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over the administration's stringent immigration policies.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. A multi-year investigation found that UPS had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS was cooperative with the investigation and, in advance of the settlement, implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to ensure proper handling and disposal.</p>
