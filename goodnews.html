          <p>Several Chinese ambassadors have recently concluded their tenures in West African nations, leading to speculation about the reasons behind these departures. While some analysts believe these are routine diplomatic rotations, others suggest it could be a subtle message to Sahelian regimes regarding resource nationalism and security concerns. The departing ambassadors played roles in strengthening Sino-African relations, particularly in countries with significant Chinese investments like Guinea, home to the Simandou iron ore mine. As ties with Western countries strained, Burkina Faso deepened relations with China, establishing a strategic partnership in 2024, highlighting the evolving dynamics between China and the region.</p>

          <p>Wicknell Chivayo, a Zimbabwean tycoon, has captivated the nation with his extravagant gifts of cars and cash to individuals deemed patriotic. Recipients range from musicians and church leaders to those loyal to the ruling Zanu-PF party. While Chivayo openly displays his wealth, the source of his riches remains under scrutiny in a country where many struggle daily. He attributes his success to government tenders secured with foreign partners and his company's involvement in renewable energy and construction projects, but some suspect corruption and close ties to those in power.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong faces a potential economic divide as its financial sector experiences a resurgence driven by China's tech-driven economy, while the food and retail industries struggle. The city's stock market is well-positioned to benefit from capital flight to Asia, spurred by credit rating downgrades and slower growth in the United States. Hong Kong's role as a platform for mainland tech companies seeking to raise funds has fueled its return as a top fundraising venue. Government policies aimed at maximizing the use of Hong Kong's financial markets have further bolstered its position as a global financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for months as the Trump administration sought to deport him.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The policy change could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, threatening critical work in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the change was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House. The release came after a U.S. envoy met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. Tikhanovsky's wife thanked President Trump for brokering the deal. The released prisoners were transferred to Lithuania, where they are receiving care. The move signals a potential warming of ties between Washington and Belarus, though many political prisoners remain in Belarusian jails.</p>
