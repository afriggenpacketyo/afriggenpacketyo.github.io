          <p>Two elderly women were dramatically rescued from a remote cabin hot tub in Kentucky after a "girls trip" took a dangerous turn, resulting in them becoming unconscious from overheating. This article details how two conscious friends resourcefully kept the others' heads above water and called 911 for help. Emergency responders found one woman in critical condition, necessitating over twenty minutes of cold-water immersion for both before hospital transfer. Fortunately, both seniors were discharged in good condition the next day, leading to renewed warnings about safe hot tub usage, particularly for older individuals or those with underlying health issues.</p>

This article notes that the PSL, celebrating over two decades as Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage, will be accompanied by new autumn-inspired additions like Pecan Cold Foam.

          <p>The Notting Hill Carnival this year saw a notable reduction in serious violence, with the Metropolitan Police reporting "far fewer" incidents compared to previous years. This article states that 423 arrests were made over two days, and only two stabbings occurred, neither resulting in serious injury, a stark contrast to last year's fatalities and numerous stabbings. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this improvement to proactive policing tactics, including live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search. Despite the positive outcome, the Met's use of LFR continues to draw criticism from civil liberty groups concerned about mass surveillance and potential bias.</p>
