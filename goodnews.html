          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, who had been detained for months, addressed reporters, stating his intention to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. The Trump administration had sought his deportation for his role in Columbia campus protests against Israel, claiming his activities aligned with Hamas, though he was not charged with any crimes. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, leading to Khalil's release and return to New York. The article highlights similar cases of other activists detained for their speech and later released by federal judges.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release pending immigration proceedings. Khalil, detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after his release, criticizing the Trump administration's actions. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil posed no threat to the community and was not a flight risk, calling his detention "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child while he was in custody; immigration officials had denied his request for temporary release to attend the birth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steve Bannon, holding no official government position, reportedly influenced President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential strike against an Iranian nuclear facility. Bannon advised Trump that Israeli intelligence couldn't be trusted and that the "bunker-buster" bomb might not work as planned. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocated for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly ceded the discussion to military commanders, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio, initially hawkish on Iran, has aligned more with a noninterventionist stance, adding to the complexity of the decision-making process.</p>

Misiorowski's impressive performance included a fastball topping out at 102.1 mph, and he left the game to a standing ovation with the Brewers leading 8-2.</p>

          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative." The discovery was made after researchers received a blood sample from the patient undergoing routine tests before surgery. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, and the discovery has been officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to "high-throughput DNA sequencing," which highlighted a genetic mutation. The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.</p>
