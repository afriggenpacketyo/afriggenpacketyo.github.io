While challenges remain, such as the use of the death penalty and limited political dissent, Ratney argues that Saudi Arabia is moving on a better path, which is in America's interest. He suggests ways for the U.S. to signal support for Saudi Arabia's success, including easing export restrictions on advanced chips and defense systems.</p>

          <p>Ryan McCarthy, former Secretary of the Army, argues that the U.S. Army needs to adapt to new threats, particularly from China, by modernizing its weapons and acquisition processes. He highlights the need to shift focus from counterterrorism to high-intensity conflict, investing in advanced technologies like hypersonic missiles and electronic warfare systems. McCarthy emphasizes the importance of rapid contracting techniques and decentralizing decision-making to ensure soldiers have the equipment they need.</p>

          <p>The temporary tariff cuts between the U.S. and China offer a potential solution to concerns about product shortages for the Christmas season. The 90-day window allows Chinese factories to resume production for U.S. clients, but the impact on Father's Day and back-to-school sales remains uncertain. Despite the tariff pause, previous tariffs remain in place, and some businesses have had to raise prices to offset the impact.</p>

          <p>A China-led international team of researchers has analyzed seismic waves from "marsquakes" and meteorite impacts, revealing evidence of liquid water locked in rock just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. This discovery, using data from NASA's InSight lander, could hold as much water as a global layer up to 780 meters thick. If confirmed, this could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>German companies, which invest heavily in the United States, are beginning to rethink their strategy due to trade tensions and tariffs. While President Trump argues tariffs will bring jobs back to the U.S., German companies, who have long had factories in the U.S., are questioning this strategy. Recent surveys indicate German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the U.S., and those with existing operations are more pessimistic about their future.</p>
