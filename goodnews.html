          <p>A DW article reports that learning multiple languages induces physical changes in the brain, enhancing cognitive abilities. Neuroscientists have found that neural pathways reshape themselves as one learns a new language, improving memory, problem-solving skills, and overall brain health. A German study involving Syrian refugees learning German showed that their brains rewired as they became more proficient, indicating neuroplasticity. This rewiring strengthens neural connections and increases gray matter in language-processing areas, suggesting that multilingualism enhances cognitive functions and cultural experiences, though its direct impact on intelligence remains debated.</p>

          <p>In their final audio conversation, New York Times columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss their eight-year-long weekly dialogue, "The Conversation." They reflect on maintaining civil discourse despite political differences, emphasizing the importance of humor and avoiding the pursuit of winning arguments. They address reader questions about how they chose topics and managed to keep the conversation respectful, highlighting the silent majority's desire for a different tone in political discussions. They note that the social media's algorithms tend to favor outrage, while their work sought to offer a more thoughtful and balanced perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fox News reports on the development of a potentially universal antivenom derived from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally subjected himself to numerous snake bites over 18 years. Friede's blood contained antibodies that reacted with neurotoxins from 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. Researchers combined two of these antibodies to create an antivenom that proved protective in mouse trials. The hope is that this research could lead to a broad-spectrum antivenom that can be administered in rural settings, offering a more effective and accessible treatment for snake bites globally.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere. The probe, originally intended for Venus, became stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. Experts believe that while some parts may burn up during reentry, the lander, designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus's atmosphere, will likely remain intact. There is a small chance that it could hit somewhere where it damages property, and there's a small chance that it could hurt someone.</p>

          <p>NPR previews the 2025 Met Gala, whose theme is "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," exploring the connection between clothing and Black identities. The exhibition, guest-curated by Monica Miller, draws inspiration from her book on Black dandyism and the styling of Black diasporic identity. Miller emphasizes that Black fashion has historically been a clash of "respectable" outfits versus looks that are more outr√©. The event will be hosted by actor Colman Domingo, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, producer and designer Pharrell Williams and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James serving as honorary chair.</p>
