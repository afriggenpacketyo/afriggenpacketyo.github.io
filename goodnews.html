          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high, closing its tenth consecutive session of gains. The surge followed an announcement from the finance minister that the government would abandon its plan to increase taxes on stock investments. This news boosted investor confidence, leading to a 0.35% rise in the main index, while the small-cap Kosdaq also saw gains. The market's performance stands in contrast to mixed results across the broader Asia-Pacific region, as investors monitor U.S.-China trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

This diplomatic engagement signals a potential recalibration of relations between the two nations.

          <p>A group of climate experts, who were dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, have revived a popular climate information website. The original site, climate.gov, was effectively dismantled, with its homepage redirected and staff terminated. Led by its former manager, the team has launched an independent successor, climate.us, to restore public access to trusted, unbiased climate data and research. The new non-governmental platform aims to counteract what they describe as the deletion and distortion of critical scientific information.</p>

Quarterback Russell Wilson had a standout performance with 450 passing yards, forming a strong connection with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was plagued by costly penalties, their overall performance was a significant improvement from their season opener and recent past. The article suggests that while the team's playoff hopes are slim, their entertaining style of play may offer fans a sense of hope.</p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates that a recent rally in the country's stock market may have further room to grow, fueled by a significant shift of household savings into equities. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and fund companies, increased by 1.17 trillion yuan. Analysts suggest that low interest rates on traditional bank deposits are pushing savers to seek better returns in the capital market. This trend is supported by an increase in the M1 money supply.

          <p>China is considering a novel approach to decarbonization by converting its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for nuclear reactors. The "Coal-to-Nuclear" (C2N) initiative, proposed by a state-owned energy group, would utilize existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions, for new fourth-generation nuclear reactors. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this strategy could offer a direct path to reducing carbon emissions. Researchers suggest this method may also face fewer hurdles regarding site safety requirements and public acceptance.</p>
