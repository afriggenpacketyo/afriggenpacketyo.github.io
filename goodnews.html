          <p>A volunteer foundation in the Dutch fishing village of Urk is using advanced DNA technology and artificial intelligence to identify fishermen lost at sea decades ago. The group, named Identiteit Gezocht (Identity Sought), analyzes historical data on weather and shipwrecks to predict where bodies may have washed ashore, then works to match DNA from unidentified remains with living relatives. This initiative has already led to the successful identification of a man missing for 47 years, bringing closure to his family. The project provides renewed hope for many families who have lived with uncertainty for generations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Club World Cup semi-final between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain is charged with drama, centering on Kylian Mbappé's first match against his former club. The reunion is set against a backdrop of legal disputes, with Mbappé still seeking €55 million in unpaid wages from PSG. His departure from Paris was acrimonious, and ironically, PSG went on to win the Champions League without him, while his first season at Madrid was trophy-less. The match is being framed as a narrative of revenge and redemption, fueled by personal bitterness and high sporting stakes.</p>

          <h2>Planet Money Highlights Recent Economic Research on Firewood, School Shootings, and Housing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A selection of recent economic papers offers insights into diverse topics, from the historical importance of firewood in the American economy to the political spending of pro-gun PACs after school shootings. One study meticulously tracks firewood prices back to 1700, showing its decline as coal became cheaper. Another paper finds that pro-gun groups strategically increase campaign contributions in districts affected by fatal school shootings. Further research highlights how Sunbelt cities are becoming less affordable as they adopt restrictive housing policies similar to coastal areas, and another shows how full-day kindergarten has boosted mothers' employment.</p>

          <p>Industry forecasts predict that Hong Kong's gross insurance premium market could surge by 55%, growing from US$82 billion to US$127 billion by 2032. This optimistic outlook is driven by the aging population in the Greater Bay Area, a megalopolis of 11 cities including Hong Kong with a combined US$2 trillion economy. According to Manulife Financial's Asia president, only 3.5% of the region's 86 million people currently have health and life insurance, presenting a vast opportunity for expansion. The trend is already visible, with new life policy sales in Hong Kong hitting a record high last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to a memo sent to TSA officers, the new policy will be rolled out at many major airports starting this week, with a goal of nationwide implementation soon. This change, which previously only applied to TSA PreCheck members, is intended to speed up security checkpoint processing. Passengers who trigger alarms at screening points will still be required to take off their shoes for additional checks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Republican-led bill, despite making cuts in other areas, includes a significant $16 billion investment in federal child care tax credits. This analysis explores how the GOP, traditionally skeptical of federal child care involvement, achieved this win where Democrats had previously failed. The effort was spearheaded by Senator Katie Britt, who leveraged a key moment during the IVF debate to build political capital and frame child care as a pro-family necessity. The new provisions expand tax credits for parents and businesses, reflecting a shifting political consensus on the economic importance of child care.</p>

          <p>A Berlin administrative court has ruled that the German government must issue visas to an Afghan family of 14 who had been promised entry under a program for individuals at risk from the Taliban. The court determined that the government's prior commitment was "legally binding" and could not be revoked by its recent decision to halt the admission scheme. The family, currently in Pakistan and facing deportation to Afghanistan, had all passed security vetting. This ruling challenges the current conservative-led government's harder stance on migration and underscores its legal obligations.</p>

          <p>The Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group has announced the identification of the 140th "stolen grandchild" from Argentina's military dictatorship. The 48-year-old man was born in a clandestine detention center in 1977 to activist parents who were "disappeared" by the regime, and he was subsequently given to another family. His identity was confirmed through DNA testing after an anonymous tip, reuniting him with his older sister, who has been searching for him for decades. The case brings both joy and a renewed focus on the hundreds of children still missing from that brutal period.</p>
