          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor participated in a debate focusing on key issues facing the city, such as housing affordability, crime, and the handling of the Trump administration. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, considered frontrunners, engaged in heated exchanges regarding their records and campaign funding. Candidates criticized Cuomo's handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations, while also targeting current Mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent. The debate highlighted the diverse perspectives and policy proposals of the candidates ahead of the Democratic primary election later this month.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper front pages highlight Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments to pensioners but clawing back funds through higher taxes. Concerns arise over potential "chaos" in recovering these payments, even from bereaved families. Immigration policies are also a major focus, with contrasting approaches from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. Other headlines include reports on weight-loss jabs, Trump's tax bill's impact on US debt, and increased free school meals for children. The Daily Star features an "ecclesiastical exclusive" about a Holy Grail hunt in the UK.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years), gaining insight into how feathers evolved during this era. The study emphasizes that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was an essential feature of the evolution of birds. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly, though there has been evidence that some species could glide or have powered flight.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may offer protection against dangerous infections. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum halved the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers believe this early microbial encounter is crucial for immune system development. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms by which these bacteria interact with the immune system, though it is known that B. longum begins by digesting breast milk.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on its onshore pipeline system near Santa Barbara. The Santa Ynez Unit, including offshore platforms and pipelines, was shut down after a major spill in 2015. The ruling, celebrated by environmental groups, argues that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. Sable officials said the decision would push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK's drug safety experts say that the impact of these medications on unborn babies is not known. There are concerns that the rising popularity of "skinny jabs" could mean many women are not using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's left-leaning government, under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, has implemented strict immigration policies, shifting from a traditionally liberal stance to address voter concerns and maintain social cohesion. The country's approach includes reducing incentives for migrants, processing asylum claims outside the continent, and tightening rules on family reunions. While asylum applications have decreased, critics argue that these policies have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law. Spain, in contrast, is taking a different approach by legalizing undocumented migrants to boost the economy and address labor shortages.</p>
