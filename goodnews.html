          <p>Caesar Sengupta, CEO of fintech startup Arta Finance which has raised $92 million, identifies the ability to ground oneself as an entrepreneur's greatest 'superpower.' The former Google executive, who led projects like Google Pay, emphasizes that filtering out noise is critical in the volatile startup world. He advocates for daily meditation as his primary strategy to maintain focus and manage the immense pressure of building a company from the ground up. Sengupta notes that this practice is essential for preserving mental and physical health while navigating the transition from a large corporation to a fragile startup environment.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has destroyed approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to restore natural water flows and save critical habitats for rare and endemic fish species. For decades, the dense network of dams has fragmented the river, blocking fish migration routes and drastically reducing suitable spawning grounds. The project is seen by ecologists as a crucial step to revive the last refuge for these unique species in the region.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player's social media account. The incident, which occurred after a National Basketball League game in November 2024, targeted a player widely reported to be former NBA star Montrezl Harrell. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a landmark moment in the fight against online abuse of athletes. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace or harass and is scheduled to appear in court in August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the sales of electric-powered heavy trucks, which is accelerating the decline in diesel consumption and oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a rapid expansion of charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This rapid adoption, primarily for short-haul routes, has surprised analysts, prompting them to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend follows the rise of electric cars and LNG-powered trucks, further solidifying the shift away from traditional fossil fuels in the world's largest crude importer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a move to bolster its resource security, China has identified 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. The discoveries include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, which are crucial for telecommunications, aerospace, and electronics. During this period, China's investment in mineral exploration, particularly for critical elements like tin, copper, and tungsten, rose by over 50%. This intensified prospecting effort is part of a strategic push to strengthen national energy and mineral security amid a global race for critical resources.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling signaling she will order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance. The ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups arguing that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause during recent immigration raids. The judge appeared to criticize the government's lack of specific evidence justifying its agents' actions. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a key battleground over the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of some U.S. residents. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the use of universal injunctions but still allows them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The lawsuit argues that the president's order is unconstitutional, violating the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born in the United States.</p>

Now 74, Bianchi will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years, ensuring he remains incarcerated for the foreseeable future for his role in the infamous crime spree.</p>

The Trump administration's restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang has noted could cost the company billions in planned orders.

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his new book, he argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—resonate most effectively with voters. He describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies. The analysis suggests that while not a guarantee of success, these words serve as powerful building blocks for creating memorable and persuasive campaign messaging.</p>

The expansion follows Tesla's recent pilot program in Austin, Texas, where invited passengers ride in remotely supervised vehicles with a human safety driver present.
