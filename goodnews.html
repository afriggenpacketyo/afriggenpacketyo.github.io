          <p>The United States and China have confirmed the details of a trade framework aimed at resuming some Chinese rare earth exports and easing certain American technology restrictions. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Beijing will review export applications for controlled items, while the U.S. will cancel a range of unspecified restrictive measures. This development follows high-level talks in London and aims to stabilize the trade relationship, which had faltered after an initial agreement in Geneva.

          <p>Twelve years after the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, former Wales winger George North reflects on one of the most iconic moments in modern rugby history. The memorable event was not his famous solo try, but a powerful carry in the second Test where he lifted Australian player Israel Folau onto his back and used him to drive through the defensive line. North, now 33 and playing in France, recalls the moment with amusement, acknowledging it as the thing fans most remember. He fondly looks back on the 2013 tour as the peak of his career.</p>

They warned that an over-reliance on subsidizing production and exporting goods could lead to increasing trade friction with the rest of the world. Panelists suggested that for China to achieve high-income status and global economic harmony, it needs to boost internal consumption. Recommendations included shifting local government performance metrics to prioritize consumption and focusing on developing the services sector, especially in smaller cities.
