A recent survey shows 530 local governments have adopted the system, though it is not legally binding like marriage. Activists highlight that while this is a major step for visibility and access to some public services, it does not grant crucial rights such as inheritance or co-parenting, fueling the ongoing call for marriage equality.</p>
