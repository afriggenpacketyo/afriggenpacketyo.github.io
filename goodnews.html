          <p>A Kyodo News podcast episode delves into Japan's debate over separate surnames for married couples, spurred by a survey revealing that nearly 30% of common-law relationships exist because couples wish to avoid changing their last names, a legal requirement unique to Japan. Three Kyodo News reporters discuss the intricacies of this issue, exploring its cultural and legal dimensions. The podcast also touches on how this debate reflects broader discussions about gender equality and individual rights within Japanese society, offering a bilingual resource for English learners interested in news writing and translation. The article analyzes how the unique surname law impacts personal choices and relationships in Japan, prompting consideration of potential legal reforms. </p>

The Times highlights research showing weight-loss drugs halved deaths from strokes and heart attacks, suggesting widespread benefits for the UK population and reduced pressure on the NHS. The Daily Express also focuses on the 'golden age' of obesity-fighting drugs, citing potential risk reduction for heart, liver, and kidney diseases. Additionally, the Daily Telegraph reports on counter-terrorism police investigating a fire at the prime minister's London home, considering possible involvement from a hostile state.</p>

          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform with a growing crypto presence, has priced its IPO at $52 per share, raising nearly $310 million and valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. The company's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will test the market's appetite for new offerings after previous plans were shelved due to tariff uncertainty. Founded in 2007, eToro competes with Robinhood and generates revenue through trading fees and non-trading activities. The company's net income significantly increased last year, driven by its expanding crypto business, and BlackRock has expressed interest in purchasing $100 million in shares at the IPO price.

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, reveals how former President Biden's aides reportedly quashed concerns about his age and cognitive abilities during his time in the White House. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, describing instances where Biden forgot names of longtime aides and confused government officials. The authors suggest a 'cover-up' of Biden's diminishing abilities, with aides spending more time avoiding the issue than addressing it. Despite these claims, the book lacks any single explosive revelation that fundamentally changes the perception of Biden's fitness to serve. </p>

          <p>Documents released in Mayor Eric Adams's federal corruption case reveal he used at least seven different cellphone numbers during the investigation, which he explained was necessary to separate personal, office, and campaign communications. The FBI tracked Adams's location using cellphone data, uncovering his use of multiple devices since August 2021. The charges against Adams, including bribery and wire fraud, were eventually dismissed, but the investigation involved seizing multiple electronic devices from Adams, including iPhones, an iPad, and a satellite phone found in Gracie Mansion. Adams has criticized the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his phone password to dyslexia.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded layoff notices for the head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and several teams, restoring worker safety programs that had been eliminated last month. This reversal comes ahead of congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. Reinstated staff include those in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. However, many workers remain laid-off at the agency, and some NIOSH employees were called back only to wind down their laboratories and research.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods, resulting from a temporary agreement between the US and China, are prompting Chinese car-parts makers to reassess plans for building production facilities in the US.

Chinese vendors express confidence that US customers will continue buying their products despite the tariffs, but uncertainty about future tariff changes is hindering deal-making.

Suzette Quintanilla expressed enthusiasm about sharing Selena's story with a global audience through Netflix, marking another collaboration between the family and the streaming platform. The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death and was awarded a special jury prize for archival storytelling at Sundance.</p>

The researchers warned that DeepSeek's tendency to generate factually incorrect outputs could lead to substantial clinical risk, despite its strong reasoning capabilities.

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to lift all sanctions against Syria, stating it is time for the country to move forward with "a chance at greatness." The announcement came during his first major foreign trip, where he also touted a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The decision to lift sanctions marks a significant shift, breaking the economic stranglehold on Syria, which is seen as critical to regional stability. Trump also expressed his "dream" to have Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords, though Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has stated this will not happen until there is a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Rate Rises by 2.3% in April, CPI Report Shows Mixed Economic Signals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 18:48:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists anticipated, yet still reflecting price hikes above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This marks the lowest level since February 2021, with housing costs being a major driver of inflation, and energy costs also ticking higher. Economists are closely watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting American households, though the effects may not be evident in the data for several months due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. may lead to a lower-than-expected rise in inflation.</p>

          <p>Jose "Pepe" Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known as the "World's Poorest President" for his humble lifestyle, has died at the age of 89. A former guerrilla fighter, Mujica was beloved for his modesty and progressive social reforms. During his presidency, he donated most of his salary and lived on a small farm, embodying a new political culture. Mujica legalized gay marriage and abortion, and his socioeconomic policies led to decreased unemployment, poverty, and infant mortality. He remained engaged in political debate until his death, leaving a legacy of authenticity and pragmatism.</p>
