        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by former Vice President Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential campaign. Trump alleges, without evidence, that some celebrities were illegally paid for their endorsements, while the celebrities in question have denied receiving payment. Campaign law experts stated that there are no FEC regulations against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements, provided those payments are properly disclosed. The Harris campaign paid production companies founded by Oprah Winfrey, Bruce Springsteen, and Beyonce for services provided during and after the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist, graduated from Columbia University after being released from ICE custody, which detained him under claims of posing "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi views his graduation as a victory against those who sought to prevent his education and activism. Despite his release, his case remains active as the Trump administration seeks his deportation. Mahdawi plans to pursue a graduate degree at Columbia, continuing his advocacy for justice and peace and criticizing the university for insufficient support during his detention.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The decision declared DOGE's actions at USIP ‚Äúnull and void‚Äù and ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge noted that Trump used force and "threats of criminal process" to take over the USIP headquarters, even though the agency is not part of the government's executive branch. The USIP said the ruling allows them to continue their work to spread peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations, covering fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks. Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely, the government said.</p>

          <p>A luxury Boeing 747 gifted to the U.S. government by Qatar is standing by at the San Antonio, Texas, airport, awaiting a specialized overhaul from a defense contractor so that President Trump can use it as the next Air Force One. Qatar's offer of the $400 million plane came to light as Trump was leaving for a trip that took him to Doha as well as stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Experts say retrofitting the plane would require years of work, which means it may not be ready until Trump is out of office.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has joined her husband President Donald Trump as he signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalizes posting "intimate images" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. While the bill has received strong bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship.</p>

With one game to go - the visit of Crystal Palace to Anfield - you still would not bet against him.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola says Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is the "second-best" passer he has worked with - after Argentine great Lionel Messi. Guardiola holds the departing Belgian in high esteem, ahead of the likes of other pass-masters he has managed such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi at Barcelona, and former City midfielder David Silva. De Bruyne announced last month he will leave City after 10 years when his contract expires at the end of the season, with his final home game against Bournemouth on Tuesday.</p>
