          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.  The lawsuit, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of various violations, including illegally serving U.S. users and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift in the U.S.'s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, particularly under the Trump administration, which is showing signs of becoming more crypto-friendly.  The case's resolution has implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
