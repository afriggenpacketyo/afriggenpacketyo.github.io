          <p>The U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors has selected David Steiner, a FedEx board member and former Waste Management CEO, as the new postmaster general. Steiner will succeed Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March, and acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino, with his formal joining of the USPS expected in July. In a statement, Steiner expressed his admiration for the USPS's public service and business mission and his belief in maintaining its independence. During his tenure as CEO of Waste Management, Steiner was credited with transforming operations and culture, leading to strong financial results, which the USPS hopes he will replicate to address their $9.5 billion net loss in 2024.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the first Jewish administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists. These activists argue that Zeldin's role in weakening environmental regulations contradicts the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world. While Zeldin maintains his policies are based on law and science, critics argue that reducing environmental protections harms Jewish values. The article highlights the differing interpretations of how Judaism addresses environmental protection, with some defending Zeldin's actions as consistent with economic growth and others condemning them as a desecration of Jewish values.</p>

          <p>South Africa's foreign ministry has criticized the United States over reports that Washington is planning to accept white Afrikaners as refugees, calling the move "politically motivated." The US has previously described Afrikaners as victims of "racial discrimination" and has accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, allegations that South Africa denies. While South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, they sought assurances from the US that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges. The US State Department has stated that they are prioritizing "Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.</p>

Sheinbaum's government contends that a decree issued by the US government only applies to the US portion of the continental shelf, and that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. Google has stated that it made the change as part of "a longstanding practice" of following name changes when updated by official government sources.

A study by Intuit Credit Karma found that 83% of consumers would strongly consider cutting back on non-essential spending if their financial situation worsens. On TikTok, money-saving hacks such as "no buy," "slow buy," and "low buy" have skyrocketed in popularity, especially among young adults.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of three color additives from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food. This move comes amid growing concerns about the health effects of food dyes, which has led to action at state and national levels. The newly approved additives include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract (expanded use), and calcium phosphate. While the administration's goal is to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives, the FDA has stopped short of an outright ban, instead accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.</p>
