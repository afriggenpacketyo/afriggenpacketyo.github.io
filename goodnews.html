          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, is launching his general election campaign with an appeal to voters outside his party. In a recent speech, Mamdani focused on affordability and the government's role in meeting citizens' "material needs," referencing his proposals for government-run grocery stores and rent freezes. He shared anecdotes of non-Democratic voters who expressed support for his campaign, signaling a strategy to build a broader coalition for the November election. Mamdani is running against former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who are both running as independents, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa in a competitive general election.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has denied that his recent comments distinguishing between "entertainers" and "competitors" were a jab at his rookie teammate, Shedeur Sanders. The remark, made during a preseason game, sparked speculation on social media as Gabriel and Sanders are competing for the starting quarterback position. Gabriel later clarified his statement, explaining that he considers the media to be the entertainers while he and his teammates are the competitors, each with a job to do. Sanders, who has received significant media attention, missed the recent game with an injury after an impressive preseason debut last week.</p>

          <p>Several key European leaders, including the German Chancellor and the French President, are set to accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington for his meeting with President Trump. This united front aims to ensure European security interests are represented in the high-stakes negotiations following the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. European officials have expressed skepticism about Russia's intentions and are seeking clarity on the extent of U.S. commitment to proposed security guarantees for Ukraine. The diplomatic push underscores Europe's desire to avoid being sidelined in decisions that will fundamentally shape the continent's security architecture and the outcome of the war.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:01:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in relationships suggests that the happiest long-term couples maintain strong connections by regularly discussing five key topics that many others neglect. These include daily check-ins on the state of their relationship to ensure both partners feel loved and supported. They also share what they are currently passionate about, discuss future dreams both big and small, and create a safe space to talk about fears and stressors. Finally, they engage in playful and spontaneous conversations about random thoughts, which helps build intimacy and a shared sense of joy. These intentional habits foster continuous growth and prevent communication from becoming purely logistical.</p>

          <h2>Russia Agrees to Potential NATO-Style Security Guarantees for Ukraine in Peace Deal Framework</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 09:40:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. official announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to allow the United States and European allies to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This development, described as a "game-changing" concession by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, emerged from the recent summit between President Trump and Putin in Alaska. While the specifics of such an arrangement are yet to be determined, it could provide a path to resolving one of the key sticking points in peace negotiations, which is Ukraine's long-term security. The topic is expected to be central to upcoming discussions between President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and European leaders in Washington.</p>
