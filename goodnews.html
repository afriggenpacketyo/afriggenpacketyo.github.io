          <p>England has opted for an unchanged team for its second Test match against India, meaning fast bowler Jofra Archer's highly anticipated return to Test cricket is postponed. Archer, who has been absent from the format for four years due to injuries, missed a recent training session for a family emergency but is set to rejoin the squad. Meanwhile, India is considering whether to play its star pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, as part of a plan to manage his workload throughout the five-Test series.

          <p>Canada has announced it will rescind its digital services tax just hours before the first payments were due, following a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to halt all trade talks. The tax would have imposed a 3% levy on Canadian revenues of large technology firms like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the move was made to allow for the resumption of negotiations on a broader trade deal. The U.S. had described the tax as a "blatant attack" and discriminatory against American companies.</p>

          <p>A new historical analysis suggests that the United States could learn valuable lessons about democracy from Latin America. While often viewed through a lens of political instability, many Latin American nations have a rich history of social movements and constitutional ideals grounded in collective well-being. From early links between independence and the abolition of slavery to enshrining social rights in law, this tradition stands in contrast to the U.S. focus on individual rights. This history offers a potential model for democratic renewal in the current political climate.</p>
