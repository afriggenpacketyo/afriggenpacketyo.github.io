          <p>Beyond Meat experienced its best day ever, with shares skyrocketing more than 146% following its addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and a new distribution agreement with Walmart. This remarkable rally, which saw the stock climb from 65 cents to around $2 per share, appears to have triggered a short squeeze. The plant-based food company has struggled for years, becoming a penny stock after its 2019 IPO. The article suggests this surge could also indicate a frothy market where investors are increasingly piling into speculative names despite elevated valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors' stock surged over 15% after the automaker surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates and increased its 2025 financial guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 on $48.59 billion in revenue, outperforming expectations. CEO Mary Barra attributed the strong performance to team efforts and a compelling vehicle portfolio, expressing confidence in the company's trajectory. Despite a 57% drop in net income due to EV-related special charges and slower-than-expected EV profitability, GM remains committed to electric vehicles and aims to improve North American profit margins.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut highly anticipated at the end of October, homeowners are weighing whether to lock in a home equity loan rate now or wait. While current home equity loan rates are lower than before, a further cut could make them even more attractive. The article suggests that a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) might be a better option for those looking to capitalize on falling rates, as HELOCs have variable rates and are currently more affordable. Borrowers should compare both options carefully, considering their comfort with fixed versus variable rates and their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, a new artificial intelligence-powered web browser designed to integrate its generative chatbot, ChatGPT, directly into the browsing experience. The browser, initially available for macOS, allows users to access ChatGPT for summaries, questions, and tasks across any webpage, eliminating the need for copy-pasting between tabs. CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as a 'once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be,' highlighting features like memory for personalization and an 'agent mode' for task completion. This launch directly positions OpenAI against Google and Perplexity AI in the evolving AI browser market, causing Alphabet shares to decline. </p>

          <p>DraftKings is acquiring Railbird, a predictions platform licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as it prepares to launch its new mobile platform, DraftKings Predictions. This acquisition aims to leverage Railbird's technology and team to expand DraftKings' offerings into prediction markets covering finance, culture, and entertainment, moving beyond its traditional sports betting business. The expansion into prediction markets, particularly those involving sports and elections, is controversial and faces regulatory scrutiny in several states. DraftKings plans to implement advanced identity verification and potentially restrict sports event contracts to unregulated states to avoid conflicts with existing gambling licenses.

          <p>As interest rates ease, many older homeowners are exploring reverse mortgages to access home equity without incurring new monthly loan payments, which is particularly appealing for those on fixed incomes. The article outlines three primary options: Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), federally insured loans with flexible payout options and consumer protections; Proprietary reverse mortgages, private jumbo loans for high-value homes offering greater flexibility but fewer protections; and Single-purpose reverse mortgages, affordable state or nonprofit loans for specific needs like property taxes or home repairs. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for retirees seeking financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates that reversing pediatric advice on peanut exposure has prevented tens of thousands of peanut allergy cases in U.S. children over the past decade. Previously, parents were advised to avoid peanuts, but a landmark 2015 study showed early introduction significantly reduced allergy risk. This shift in health guidance, recommending peanut product introduction as early as 4-6 months for high-risk infants, led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence. The article highlights this as a major public health success, starting to curb the epidemic of food allergies in the country. </p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was averted thanks to the swift action of a family who alerted police about their relative's alarming social media posts. Billy Joe Cagle, 49, was arrested inside the terminal, and an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was found in his truck. Cagle's brother, Scott Nelson, explained that his brother struggles with mental health and hallucinates without medication.

          <p>The opportunity to open highly profitable Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts is rapidly diminishing as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement two more rate cuts by year-end, with one anticipated next week. While CD rates are still competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, they are lower than in recent years and are likely to continue declining. Savers can still earn over $800 on a $10,000 deposit in a 2-year CD at current rates, but prompt action is advised. The article stresses that it could take years for CD rates to reach these levels again. (not investment advice)</p>
