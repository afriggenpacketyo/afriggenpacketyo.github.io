          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary offers several lessons for Democrats, including the importance of charisma, populist messaging, and evolving views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Mamdani's ability to communicate effectively across various media formats and his emphasis on affordability resonated with voters. His success suggests that attacking opponents as insufficiently pro-Israel is not a surefire strategy. The win also potentially elevates Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's prospects for the 2028 presidential nomination, while underscoring the challenges progressives face in appealing to diverse voter bases.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares experienced a surge of over 4%, reaching a record high and surpassing its previous peak from January, as investors expressed confidence in the company's leadership in artificial intelligence despite export controls in China.

The company's success is attributed to its dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) used for building large language models and running AI workloads.

          <p>Flagstar bank shares dropped following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary due to his campaign promise to freeze rent increases in stabilized units. Analysts estimate a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations. While some analysts believe a short-term rent freeze would be manageable, a longer-term pause could lead the bank to raise loan loss reserves. Other real estate stocks with New York City exposure also experienced downward pressure, as Mamdani has also called for a higher corporate tax rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve proposed easing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move that drew dissent from officials concerned about undermining financial safeguards.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the change is prudent given the increase in safe assets on bank balance sheets.

          <p>While Iran has the potential to disrupt the global economy by blockading the Strait of Hormuz, doing so would likely be an own goal due to the economic implications. Iran relies heavily on oil exports, particularly to China, and a blockade would harm its own revenue and upset its trading partner. Neighboring countries like Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates also rely on the strait for oil transport. Furthermore, a blockade would likely provoke a swift military response from the US and European countries, and would only undermine remaining alliances with countries in the region.</p>
