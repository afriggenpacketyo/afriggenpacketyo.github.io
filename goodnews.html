          <p>The luxury fashion sector is shifting away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend and embracing more visible, statement-making styles known as "loud luxury." This change, driven by new creative directors at major brands like Gucci and Burberry, aims to inject novelty and reignite desire among consumers weary of recent price hikes. Analysts believe this pivot towards bold branding and distinctive designs could be a turning point for an industry struggling with soft consumer sentiment and economic headwinds.

          <p>A four-person international crew of astronauts successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean in a SpaceX capsule after completing their mission. The crew was instrumental in relieving two NASA astronauts who had been stranded on the International Space Station for nine months due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. This event marked NASA's first crewed Pacific splashdown in 50 years and was hailed as a great success for the Commercial Crew Program and international space collaboration.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol achieved a significant milestone in sports history by becoming the first woman to serve as an umpire in a regular-season Major League Baseball game. Her debut occurred during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she officiated at first base to a warm reception from fans and players. The 48-year-old, who has umpired in the minor leagues since 2016, donated her cap from the historic game to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, marking the momentous occasion.</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" that promise benefits like calm and relaxation is booming, but nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical about their efficacy. Experts point out that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine in these drinks are unlikely to produce significant effects, with some studies suggesting much higher doses are needed for any potential impact. While the drinks may offer a good alternative to alcohol, one psychologist suggests the feeling of calm may come from the ritual of consumption rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors, for his 50 years of service. Now 72, Akbar has been a beloved figure on the city's Left Bank since 1973, witnessing the decline of print media firsthand as his daily sales of Le Monde dropped from 80 to around 30. Despite the changing times, he continues his work for the freedom and joy it brings, remaining a cherished part of his neighborhood's culture.</p>

          <p>A recent declaration by singer Ed Sheeran that he is "culturally Irish" has sparked a broader conversation about the complex and evolving nature of Irish identity in 2025. The article explores how Irishness is no longer a simple binary, especially in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, and can encompass blended heritages, diaspora connections, and a wide spectrum of cultural influences. This nuanced identity is shaped by history, music, language, and personal experience, challenging rigid definitions and reflecting a more globalized and interconnected world.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of enjoying films that are critically panned is explored through the lens of the new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, which received a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes. This article discusses why audiences are often drawn to "bad" movies, suggesting that their lack of polish, unintentional humor, and earnest but failed ambition can be more entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters. For many viewers and film clubs, the shared experience of watching a uniquely terrible movie provides a memorable and charming form of entertainment.</p>

          <p>Six months after its surprising launch, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to impact the artificial intelligence industry, despite falling from the headlines. The app's initial success challenged the American-led assumption that bigger and more expensive models were always better, proving that capable AI could be built with smarter, more efficient engineering. While concerns about data security and links to Beijing persist, DeepSeek's arrival has spurred a shift toward developing smaller, cost-effective models and intensified the US-China AI rivalry.</p>

          <p>Apple experienced its most significant weekly stock gain in more than five years, with shares rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. This surge followed a White House meeting where CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump announced Apple's plan to increase spending with American companies, securing a promise of exemption from future tariffs on imported chips. The positive investor reaction highlights the relief from long-standing worries that potential trade tariffs could have substantially damaged the company's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

While Beijing is expected to view the participation negatively, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid undermining their recent diplomatic progress.</p>

          <h2>Neurologist Recommends Pomegranates for Enhanced Brain Health in Adults Over 50</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist is advising people over the age of 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which provide powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and may interact with certain medications, they are highlighted as a top choice among brain-healthy fruits like blueberries and grapes.</p>
