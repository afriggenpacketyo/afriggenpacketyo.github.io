          <p>President Trump declared the cessation of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the war-torn nation. Trump highlighted his administration's initial steps towards normalizing relations with Syria, which has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The move follows the toppling of the Assad regime in December 2024 and aims to support the transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. Aid organizations have been pushing for sanctions relief to facilitate humanitarian assistance and economic recovery following the devastating 2023 earthquake.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced organizational changes, including potential job cuts impacting around 1,700 roles globally, as part of its turnaround efforts. CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy aims to revive the brand, following ¬£40 million in cost-cutting measures announced in November.

The company flagged increased geopolitical tension as a key downside risk, with CFO Kate Ferry noting the U.S. tariffs' impact is very dynamic and the company will respond accordingly.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including proposed tariffs and budget cuts, are creating uncertainty for the renewable energy sector in the United States. While clean energy has seen significant growth in recent years, the administration's preference for fossil fuels and potential tariffs on imported components could hinder progress. Tariffs on Southeast Asia, in particular, could significantly impact solar energy development, as the region supplies critical inputs for solar module manufacturing. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the unstable policy environment is causing concern among investors and developers.</p>

Aides allegedly worried about the political implications of Biden using a wheelchair during his campaign.

Young employees are often reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of clear corporate structure and perception of it being a 'retirement job'. Family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent, including offering bonuses and co-investment opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce tariffs on each other's imports, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions. The U.S. administration cut tariffs imposed on China to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. to 10% from 125%. The agreement also involves suspending non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. Both sides will establish a consultation mechanism to discuss trade issues, aiming to iron out details for the future trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries. The chimpanzees were filmed using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. This research builds on previous discoveries that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate. The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use "forest first aid", including leaf-dabbing and hygiene habits.</p>

          <p>As President Trump implements policies that gut American research institutions, world leaders are viewing this as a ‚Äúonce-in-a-century brain gain opportunity.‚Äù Countries such as France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, and Australia are all offering financial incentives, academic freedom, and social security to attract American researchers. A recent poll showed that 75% of Ph.D. or postdoctoral students in the U.S. were considering leaving the country due to the Trump administration's policies. These nations aim to capitalize on the talent that has been cast aside or become disenchanted.</p>
