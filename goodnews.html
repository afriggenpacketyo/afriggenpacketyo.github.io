        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has granted a third 90-day extension to the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States, as a deal to separate the app from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, remains elusive. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the extension will allow the administration to continue working towards a deal that ensures the safety and security of American users' data. The orders have directed the Justice Department not to penalize companies like Apple and Google for not removing TikTok from their platforms, with the current extension set to expire on Thursday. This decision reflects the administration's ongoing efforts to address national security concerns related to the app while avoiding a complete shutdown. The delay provides more time for negotiations and potential resolutions to safeguard user data, allowing Americans to continue using the popular video-sharing platform. </p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a significant bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars with government approval. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, granting substantial authority to the Treasury Secretary. While the bill now moves to the House, where a different version called STABLE exists, its passage in the Senate marks a major milestone for the crypto industry and President Trump's digital asset initiatives. The legislation aims to protect consumers, promote innovation, and maintain the U.S. dollar's dominance in the digital economy (not investment advice).</p>

This chip, developed by Amazon's Annapurna Labs, underscores the company's successful custom chip strategy, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The primary focus is competing with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence infrastructure space, as highlighted by AWS's Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer built for Anthropic, backed by an $8 billion investment. AWS aims to reduce AI training costs and offer an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs, with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model already utilizing Trainium2 GPUs, indicating a shift in traditional order patterns.</p>

          <p>The human remains discovered near Taylor Swift's mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island, have been identified as those of Eric Wein, a 31-year-old from Massachusetts who was reported missing in April. Police located Wein's vehicle in South Kingstown prior to him being reported missing and have stated that no foul play is suspected, concluding the investigation. This discovery follows recent speculation about a possible serial killer in New England, fueled by the discovery of multiple bodies in the region since March. Despite these fears, authorities maintain that Wein's death is unrelated to any serial killer activity, attributing the rumors to social media influence.</p>

Jassy stated that as Amazon rolls out more generative AI tools, fewer people will be needed for certain tasks, while more will be required for other types of jobs. This shift towards AI is intended to allow human workers to focus on more creative and strategic roles, though some employees have expressed concerns about an intensified and less thoughtful work environment. Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications in development or already built, with plans to expand this further.</p>

The incident occurred during discussions about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer hailed as a significant relief for Jaguar Land Rover workers and their supply chain, averting potential job losses. The deal removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and reduces levies on car exports from the UK to the US, though negotiations on steel import charges are ongoing.</p>

This lawsuit is separate from another challenge to Trump's tariffs that was filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, which blocked Trump's 10% tariff on virtually every U.S. trading partner.

          <p>Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes, meaning women who terminate their pregnancies outside the current legal framework will no longer be at risk of criminal investigation. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, the new clause does not alter existing regulations regarding abortion services within healthcare settings. Campaigners and medical organizations have welcomed the decision as a victory for women's rights and autonomy.</p>
