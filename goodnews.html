          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy, 66, is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, requiring him to relearn his own songs and guitar skills after decades focused on a behind-the-scenes career as a television writer and producer. Cassidy, son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, found fame in the 1970s as a pop star and actor, but admitted he never enjoyed the public spotlight. His "The Road to Us Tour" will feature classic hits, new music, and personal stories, with Cassidy taking on the bass guitar for a fresh challenge. He expresses that the songs feel new to him, allowing him to sing better than in his youth.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support for Mamdani's progressive campaign and condemning oligarchic control in the US. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement as a "test case" for democracy against wealthy donors and media moguls aligned with figures like Donald Trump. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, has vowed to freeze rent prices, increase housing, and raise taxes for the city's wealthiest, advocating for working-class and low-income residents. The event also saw Mamdani address the dismissal of CUNY professors for anti-war Palestinian solidarity, drawing an energized response from the crowd.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans' offense delivered a dominant performance, routing Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team 59-20, accumulating 755 yards—the most for USC in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava threw four touchdowns and shattered his career high with 412 passing yards before the fourth quarter. The rushing attack also excelled, gaining 309 yards, a new high for the Lincoln Riley era. Despite a sloppy start with a fumble and a defensive penalty, USC quickly found its rhythm, with receivers Ja’Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon making significant plays. While the defense showed some vulnerabilities, the overwhelming offensive power secured another seamless win for the Trojans.</p>

          <h2>US-China Team Develops Bubble-Popping Method for Robot Launch</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles on the surface. When these bubbles reach a critical size, they violently collapse, releasing a powerful force that propels the small jumpers. Scientists can control the launch and even enable the materials to swim by manipulating the light flow, demonstrating a new efficient launching mechanism through cavitation.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating home favorite Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in a hard-fought final. This victory marks Sabalenka's first Grand Slam trophy of the year, following defeats in the Australian and French Open finals. The Belarusian player, known for her powerful game, maintained emotional composure, a factor she admitted was challenging in previous majors. Anisimova, who had thrashed Sabalenka at Wimbledon, showed improvement from her earlier major final loss but ultimately succumbed to Sabalenka's consistent level and tactical approach, leaving her in tears.</p>

          <p>Schools across the US are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, with approximately 2.5 million students already using them. This article details the system, where students secure their phones in a pouch that locks upon entering school and unlocks upon leaving, using magnets. Educators and parents support the measure, citing reduced distractions and improved student engagement. While some students express skepticism or attempt to bypass the system, many, like Yonkers Middle High School senior Sariyah Fidelis, have reported positive changes, including more in-person interaction. The company aims to foster a culture shift, giving students back opportunities for life outside a "fully digital realm."</p>

          <p>China utilized the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin to assert its vision for a multipolar international order and bolster its geopolitical standing as a reliable global interlocutor. The article highlights a significant moment where President Xi Jinping engaged cheerfully with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling an unexpected camaraderie among these nations. This display comes as US credibility is perceived to be faltering under President Donald Trump's disruptions to international norms. The SCO, a modest Eurasian institution, focuses on combating terrorism, extremism, and integrating economic initiatives like China's Belt and Road.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats after a viral incident where an adult woman took a coveted home run ball from him during a game against the Miami Marlins. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, but a man initially gave it to him, only for a woman to claim it, leading to a public confrontation. Recognizing the significance of such an event for a young fan, both the Phillies and Marlins organizations intervened. The boy, Lincoln Feltwell, was given a Marlins gift bag and later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, and received an autographed bat.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to expand its political footprint and diversify its public image beyond its prominent leader, Nigel Farage. The article highlights the party's efforts to promote new candidates and elected officials, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, who have defected from the Conservatives. With national opinion polls suggesting significant growth, Reform UK aims to contest more seats in upcoming elections. The party is implementing more rigorous candidate vetting processes, described as "assembling a jumbo jet while flying it," to ensure quality and avoid past scandals, as it builds a "people's army" of volunteers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who have served in dangerous front-line military roles. Co-founding "Sisters in Service," a community interest company, Dr. Bennett helps female military veterans, particularly those in healthcare, connect and support each other. She highlights that many people hold "outdated ideas" about women's roles in modern conflicts, leading to isolation for female veterans who often find traditional support spaces daunting. The organization aims to provide a "cathartic" community where women can share experiences, laugh, and joke about their shared paths.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoy military equipment, such as inflatable tanks and flat-pack guns, to deceive Russian forces and compel them to waste valuable ammunition and resources. This article highlights that a significant portion of frontline equipment, from radars to tanks, are imitations, with some weapon types having at least half their deployed units as decoys. Volunteers play a crucial role, manufacturing items like plywood M777 howitzer models that cost around $500-600 but draw expensive Russian Lancet kamikaze drones. The effectiveness of these decoys depends on realistic deployment, including wheel ruts and ammunition crates, successfully fooling even visiting commanders.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Carlo, who died of leukemia at 15, was known for creating websites to document "miracles" and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican, with Pope Francis attributing two miracles to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. This article notes the increase in visitors to his baptismal church in Chelsea and highlights the excitement among young Catholics who feel a closer connection to a saint who played video games and wore jeans.</p>
