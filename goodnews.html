          <p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) aims to launch its single currency, the ECO, by 2027, despite significant challenges that have plagued its development since 2019. Economic disparities, political instability, and the withdrawal of three member states—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger—pose substantial hurdles to monetary integration. Experts suggest that a successful implementation would require strong political alignment and a shared monetary policy, drawing parallels to Europe's Euro. The article highlights the potential for the ECO to strengthen the region's global economic standing, if these obstacles can be overcome.</p>

          <p>A mysterious glowing, pill-shaped object observed over upstate New York went viral, sparking widespread UFO speculation among residents. Photos shared online led to descriptions of the object as "otherworldly." However, the phenomenon was later confirmed to be the planned launch of the Vulcan Centaur rocket by the United Launch Alliance from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Rear Admiral (ret.) Tim Gallaudet emphasized the importance of cross-referencing visual sightings with other data to distinguish between misidentifications and genuine Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. This article demonstrates how quickly speculation can arise around unexplained aerial events.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the historical transformation of American attitudes towards exercise, charting its journey from post-World War II inactivity and skepticism, particularly for women, to today's pervasive fitness culture. Journalist Danielle Friedman highlights key moments, including President JFK's push for national fitness in the 1960s and the profound impact of the 1970s women's movement and Title IX. The rise of jogging, aerobic dancing, yoga, and weightlifting, popularized by figures like Jane Fonda and Arnold Schwarzenegger, reshaped public perception. The article concludes that modern fitness culture, as we know it, is largely an American commercial invention.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights consortium, a joint venture by Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies, has initiated operations for the world's first commercial carbon storage service, injecting CO2 into the North Sea seabed. This project aims to capture and permanently store CO2 from European industrial sources, preventing its release into the atmosphere to combat climate change. While Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is endorsed by the UN and IEA as a climate tool, it remains controversial and costly. Critics, like Stanford professor Mark Jacobson, argue that direct air capture is not a viable solution, advocating instead for a rapid transition to clean energy sources.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 6% pullback to $4,548.32, erasing recent gains after reaching a fresh record of $4,954.81 over the weekend. Bitcoin also saw a decline, with both cryptocurrencies losing ground following an earlier rally spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at interest rate cuts. Despite this volatility, Ether has shown resilience, maintaining the $4,000 level this month, supported by regulatory tailwinds, increased interest in tokenization, and corporate accumulation.

          <p>This article argues that parents often underestimate the significant costs of allowing phones in schools, which extend beyond academic distraction to include increased social anxiety and suppressed opportunities for emotional and intellectual growth. The author, a former teacher, highlights how the mere presence of a phone can reduce focus and hinder students' ability to develop independence and resilience. While parents value emergency communication, the article suggests that constant monitoring offers only temporary relief for adult discomfort. Implementing phone bans, as seen in Australia, can lead to improved learning and social interaction. This piece advocates for embracing discomfort to foster student growth.</p>

The FRESH program's "kick and kill" strategy, utilizing vesatolimod and broadly neutralizing antibodies tailored for African HIV strains, resulted in four women achieving remission, with Anele remaining HIV-free two years after stopping medication. This milestone offers significant hope, especially for Africa, which bears the disproportionate burden of the global HIV epidemic. This article details a major step forward in medical research.</p>

          <p>New research challenges the perception of fish as "simple-minded animals," suggesting they may experience pleasure and actively seek it out, particularly from being groomed by other fish. A study in *Proceedings of the Royal Society B* found that threadfin butterflyfish enjoyed and sought out "cleaning" interactions with bluestreak cleaner wrasse, even when parasite-free. Experiments with opioid-mimicking drugs indicated that this pleasure is mediated by the fish's opioid system, suggesting a capacity for positive emotional-like states. This article expands our understanding of animal sentience and encourages a rethinking of how fish are treated.</p>
