          <p>This article from Fox News discusses the potential mood changes associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which are used for weight loss and diabetes management. Some studies suggest these medications can cause mental health complications like anxiety and depression, while others link mood changes to genetic variations. Doctors interviewed in the article offer differing opinions, with some believing there is no direct causal relationship and others stressing the importance of monitoring patients' mental health. The article emphasizes the need for further research and a holistic approach to weight loss that includes mental health support, and advises patients to communicate with their medical providers about any mood changes they experience.

          <p>This NPR article draws parallels between President Trump's current legislative efforts and Ronald Reagan's economic policies in the 1980s, particularly the use of budget reconciliation to enact significant tax and spending changes. The article highlights the ambitious nature of both Reaganomics and Trump's "one big, beautiful bill," as well as the presence of powerful unelected officials driving the policy changes. It also discusses the political context surrounding both initiatives, including the use of reconciliation to bypass the filibuster and the challenges of enacting large-scale policy changes. The article concludes by noting that the effects of Reaganomics are still debated today, and that the success of Trump's current efforts will shape the narrative of his second term.</p>
