          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations on earnings but falling short on revenue. The bank's profit saw a modest increase to $7.12 billion, while its total revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below forecasts. A key factor was the firm's net interest income, which, despite growing year-over-year, missed estimates due to the impact of lower interest rates compared to the previous year. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted consumer resilience and growth in deposits and loans as positive indicators for the company's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain has officially lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume flights to the UK. The suspension was initially imposed in 2020 after a scandal revealed that nearly a third of Pakistan's pilots held fraudulent licenses, a discovery that followed a fatal crash in Karachi. The decision comes after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency also lifted its ban earlier this year, recognizing significant improvements in Pakistan's aviation safety standards. This move is expected to provide a major boost to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which is currently undergoing privatization.</p>

          <p>China and Egypt have signed agreements to promote the use of the Chinese yuan, marking a significant step in China's strategy to increase its currency's global footprint. The deals, signed during a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, will facilitate local currency settlements through China's CIPS payment system, an alternative to SWIFT. This move positions Africa as a key testing ground for the internationalization of the yuan. Egypt now joins other African nations like South Africa and Nigeria in strengthening financial cooperation with Beijing, aiming to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in international trade.</p>

          <h2>DNC Chair Focuses on Rebuilding Voter Trust Amid Internal Party Divisions</h2>

          <p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin stated his focus is on re-earning voter trust across the country rather than engaging in "internal bullshit" and party drama. Acknowledging that Democrats lost trust by only appearing before elections, he is spearheading an "organizing summer" initiative to engage with communities year-round. The party's strategy for the midterms will heavily message against President Trump's spending plan, framing it as detrimental to American families. Martin emphasized the need for a "big tent party" that can unify despite internal disagreements over strategy and primary endorsements, aiming to move past the 2024 election loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported a 15% drop in sales in Japan for the first quarter, as a strengthening yen curbed the spending spree by international tourists. This marks a sharp reversal from the previous year when a weaker yen fueled a 59% surge in revenues, particularly from Chinese shoppers. Despite the downturn in Japan, the Cartier-owner's overall group sales rose 6% to €5.41 billion, driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division. The results highlight the significant impact of currency fluctuations on the global luxury market and Richemont's relative resilience amid a broader industry slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's implementation of visa-free travel policies for citizens of several countries has led to a significant increase in foreign arrivals, with 38 million trips recorded in the first half of 2025. This represents a 30% year-on-year increase, signaling a strong recovery in the nation's tourism and business travel sectors. The National Immigration Administration stated that the visa facilitation measures have been effective in attracting visitors and boosting inbound consumption. The policy builds on earlier, more restrictive transit visa programs, now allowing for broader travel within the country for many nationalities, which has helped revitalize international engagement.</p>

The deal follows a series of tariff threats issued by the White House to numerous trading partners. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who described Trump as a "tough negotiator," confirmed a deal was made that marked a "new era of mutual benefit."</p>

          <p>Asset management giant Blackstone has been actively acquiring rental housing properties across the U.S., including apartment complexes, student housing, and single-family homes. The company's strategy focuses on markets with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states and major cities. Despite owning less than 1% of the nation's rental stock, Blackstone's significant investments through vehicles like the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) position it to benefit from current market dynamics. Experts note that with construction costs high, buying existing properties is often cheaper than building, which supports rent growth and makes these acquisitions potentially lucrative.

          <p>Singer Miley Cyrus has announced that she has "no desire" to go on a major tour, citing the difficulty of maintaining her sobriety and mental health while on the road. Speaking just weeks after releasing her ninth album, Cyrus explained that she does not feel there is adequate support for artists' well-being during the strenuous touring process. Her last major tour was over a decade ago in 2014. The comments add to a growing conversation within the music industry about the personal toll that extensive touring can take on performers, even for those at the peak of their careers.</p>

          <p>A deacon at a Michigan church is being praised as a hero for preventing a potential mass shooting by ramming an armed attacker with his pickup truck. Richard Pryor saw a man in a tactical vest begin firing a rifle outside the CrossPointe Community Church in June and decided he had to act immediately. His intervention, which drew gunfire towards his vehicle, temporarily stopped the shooter and allowed the church's armed security team to respond and fatally shoot the assailant. Pryor's courageous actions are credited with saving the lives of over 100 congregants, including many children, who were inside at the time.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are identifying key lifestyle habits that can help mitigate the natural cognitive decline that occurs with age. A large-scale online study called MindCrowd has found that individuals who perform cognitively like people 30 years younger often share common traits. These include getting high-quality sleep, maintaining good cardiovascular health by managing blood pressure and cholesterol, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking. Neuroscientists emphasize that understanding the mechanisms of brain aging is crucial, and simple, consistent behaviors like waking at the same time daily and staying physically active can significantly improve brain health both structurally and functionally over a lifetime.</p>
