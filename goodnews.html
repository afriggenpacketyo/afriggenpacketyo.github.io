        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup supported by Jeff Bezos, is developing a modular, stripped-down two-door electric pickup truck with a target starting price under $20,000. The company is currently producing beta vehicles at a facility near Detroit and plans to begin deliveries by the end of next year from a full production facility in Warsaw, Indiana, with a capacity of up to 150,000 vehicles annually. Slate emphasizes simplified manufacturing, use of off-the-shelf parts, and customer personalization through wraps and bolt-on accessories to lower costs. While the company has attracted significant reservations, it faces challenges in scaling production, establishing supply chains, and navigating regulatory uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary method of communication for millions of patients, with a ¬£50 million investment aimed at saving the health service ¬£200 million over three years. More test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders will be sent directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The Department of Health and Social Care plans to send 270 million messages through the app this year, an increase of 70 million, and will provide text messages and letters as alternatives for those without app access. The move intends to improve patient access to healthcare management and reduce missed appointments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming UK Spending Review is expected to reveal significant increases in overall government spending, with totals exceeding ¬£650 billion by 2029-30, roughly ¬£100 billion more than when Labour took office. While this reflects a considerable rise compared to previous years, much of the funding is earmarked for long-term projects and specific departments like the NHS. Short-term spending will remain tight, and internal disputes persist over budget allocations for different government areas. The government hopes to use the review to demonstrate its commitment to security, health, and investment.</p>
