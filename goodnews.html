          <h2>Ozempic Users Report Unexpected Cravings for Specific Smells.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 18:19:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some individuals using Ozempic and similar weight-loss drugs have reported experiencing changes in their sense of smell, with some developing cravings for sugary perfumes and scents. While Ozempic is known for gastrointestinal side effects, this olfactory phenomenon, dubbed "Ozempic smell," is a lesser-known effect. Experts suggest that the drug's impact on digestion may contribute to these changes in taste and smell perception, as the regions controlling these senses are linked to the hormone regulated by the medication. The rise in popularity of gourmand fragrances aligns with this trend, though further research is needed to establish a definitive link between GLP-1 medications and altered olfactory preferences.</p>

          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. would not impose tariffs on natural resources the country lacks, addressing concerns about rising consumer prices. During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Lutnick cited bananas, spices, and roots as examples of items exempt from duties. He emphasized the need for fair trade practices, particularly regarding U.S. agricultural exports, and the U.S. is currently engaged in trade negotiations with multiple countries ahead of a July 8 deadline, when President Trump's pause on proposed tariffs is set to expire. The negotiations aim to improve market access for American farmers and ranchers. </p>

          <p>The government has banned six water companies from paying bonuses to senior executives due to their failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to companies that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, are not financially resilient or have been convicted of a criminal offence. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to force firms to claw back bonuses or face enforcement action. This action comes amid growing public concern over sewage spills and rising bills, while water companies have paid out significant rewards to executives. </p>
