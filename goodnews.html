        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an ambitious agricultural experiment, the UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in east England, benefiting from the country's hottest summer on record. This trial, led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production methods amidst climate change. Beyond food security, the project also seeks to re-wet peat soils in the Fens region, which could lock away greenhouse gases and contribute to climate mitigation efforts. The initiative highlights innovative approaches to farming in a changing climate.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with recent deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Trump have facilitated these ventures, including Oracle's increased role with TikTok and Skydance's acquisition of Paramount. The family is also reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, potentially creating one of the largest media giants. This concentration of media power has drawn criticism from lawmakers concerned about potential conflicts of interest and journalistic independence.</p>

Their research, conducted in university hostels, confirmed widespread embarrassment caused by shoe odor and identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the culprit. The study led to a prototype design for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear, offering a practical solution to a common domestic problem and earning them recognition for 'making people laugh, then think.'</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit stemmed from Giuliani's baseless claims of election rigging following the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion made with Fox News and Newsmax. The resolution marks another legal and financial setback for Giuliani, who has faced disbarment and significant financial penalties for his role in spreading election conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly EV, the Model Y L, has achieved stunning success in China, selling out its September and October allocations shortly after its August launch. Over 35,000 orders were placed on launch day, with new deliveries not expected until November. This surge in demand is critical for Tesla, which has faced sales challenges globally, and positions the company strongly in China's competitive EV market. The Model Y L's expanded cabin space and lower price point are broadening its appeal, contributing to reduced transportation pollution and accelerating EV adoption.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an overwhelming 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only two and a half points for retention. The European team's performance has been exceptional, setting a record for their largest pre-singles lead. The event was marred by controversial behavior from American fans, who directed thuggish and personal insults at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite the hostile atmosphere, Europe's dominance has left thousands of US spectators leaving early, with resale ticket prices plummeting.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his new book 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure and his role as a 'swing justice.' Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse and the Supreme Court's tone, advocating for more respectful conversation. He reveals the personal and legal considerations behind his pivotal votes on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, emphasizing that 'the cases swung, not me.' Kennedy also critiques the doctrine of originalism, arguing for a broader interpretation of 'liberty' that evolves over time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a topic of ongoing debate among dermatologists and researchers. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, experts like consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth remain skeptical due to challenges in collagen absorption and targeted delivery within the body. Oral collagen peptides face hurdles in the digestive system, and topical creams are deemed ineffective for reaching deeper skin layers. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research frequently finds no substantial effect, prompting calls for more robust evidence.</p>
