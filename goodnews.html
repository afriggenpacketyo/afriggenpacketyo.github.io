          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy shift, allowing verified adult ChatGPT users to access erotic materials starting in December, departing from prior content prohibitions. This change aims to treat adult users like adults, following efforts to mitigate mental health risks that previously led to restrictive chatbot interactions. While safeguards for minors are being expanded with new tools and parental controls, the company is also preparing to launch an updated ChatGPT version. This future iteration will enable the chatbot to adopt more distinct personalities, offering users greater customization for human-like or expressive interactions, reflecting a broader evolution in AI interaction design.</p>

          <p>Scams targeting older Americans are rapidly increasing, with federal officials noting the tactics are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. The FBI reported that seniors filed the most scam complaints last year, with average losses climbing to $83,000, a 43% increase. In response, AARP launched Senior Planet, a national program offering free fraud-awareness classes for individuals aged 60 and older. The program teaches participants to identify red flags, recognize fake communications, and resist pressure to share sensitive information, helping to protect vulnerable populations from significant financial exploitation.</p>

          <p>US and UK authorities have seized over $14 billion in Bitcoin and charged Chen Zhi, founder of Cambodia's Prince Group, with masterminding a vast cryptocurrency scam. Zhi, a UK and Cambodian national, faces wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges, with his businesses sanctioned and assets frozen, including £100m in London properties. Prosecutors allege the Prince Group operated a "sprawling cyber-fraud empire" with scam compounds, using forced labor to trick victims into transferring crypto with false investment promises. This joint operation represents one of the largest financial takedowns in history, targeting a criminal enterprise built on human suffering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USA men's soccer team secured a 2-1 victory over Australia in a friendly match, with Haji Wright scoring both goals after falling behind early. Captain Christian Pulisic was forced off with a lower leg injury in the first half following several heavy challenges, creating an early setback for the American squad. Despite Australia's opening goal, the USA controlled possession and created more chances, demonstrating improved performance under manager Mauricio Pochettino. This win marks a positive step for the World Cup co-hosts as they continue preparations for next year's tournament.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar complete game, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a commanding 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. This performance, the Dodgers' first postseason complete game since 2004, silenced the Brewers' offense after an early home run. The Dodgers' relentless lineup, including home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy, provided ample run support, establishing a formidable 2-0 series lead. With the series shifting to Dodger Stadium, the defending World Series champions are now in a strong position to advance, making the "Magic Brew" feel increasingly out of reach for Milwaukee.</p>

          <p>Fesia Davenport, Los Angeles County's chief executive officer, received a $2 million settlement this summer due to professional repercussions from Measure G. This voter-approved ballot measure will make her appointed position obsolete by 2028, transitioning it to an elected role. Davenport's letter to the county's top lawyer cited "reputational harm, embarrassment, and physical, emotional and mental distress" as reasons for the damages. The settlement prevents her from suing the county regarding Measure G's impact, highlighting the significant personal and professional toll of the governmental restructuring.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement by Red Tractor, the UK's largest certifier of farm products, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA ruled that Red Tractor lacked sufficient evidence to substantiate claims that its certified farms ensured a high degree of environmental protection. Environmental group River Action, which filed the complaint, accused the scheme of "greenwashing" and urged supermarkets to reconsider its use. Red Tractor, however, called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards enforcement.</p>

Supervisors highlighted that the raids have caused widespread fear, decreased workplace attendance, disrupted local economies, and strained essential services for the county's over 3 million immigrants.

These automatic protections, rolling out by year-end, will place teen accounts under a 13+ setting, requiring parental permission to opt out. The restrictions will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Additionally, Instagram's integrated AI technology will be prohibited from giving age-inappropriate responses, and a "Limited Content" setting offers parents even more restrictive options to safeguard their teens' online experience.</p>
