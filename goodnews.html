Paul controlled the fight against a largely inactive Ch√°vez, who offered little offense until the later rounds. After the victory, Paul taunted the booing, pro-Ch√°vez crowd, telling them to "shut the f--- up." Ch√°vez later admitted he thought he lost the first five rounds and that while Paul is a good fighter, he is not yet ready for champions.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment into satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to build a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move follows Eutelsat's 2023 merger with British venture OneWeb and positions the company as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, experts express skepticism about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future. Eutelsat's constellation of 650 low Earth orbit satellites is significantly smaller than Starlink's 7,600, posing a major challenge in scale and capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10km from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in cross-strait relations. Once a heavily militarized front line, it has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its strategic location, on-the-ground observations show that both Beijing and Taipei face significant limitations in their ability to influence the island. The community exists in a delicate balance, a symbol of both past conflict and the current complex political standoff.</p>

Under the voluntary partnership, retailers will decide how to encourage healthier choices, possibly through promotions, loyalty point adjustments, or store layout changes. Major retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The initiative is part of a broader 10-year plan for the NHS aimed at curbing rising healthcare costs and creating a healthier generation.</p>
