          <p>During an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Elon Musk defended the work of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stating that he expects it will achieve $1 trillion in cuts "over time." Trump praised Musk's efforts, calling his work "without comparison in modern history." While DOGE's initial savings fell short of the $1 trillion goal, Musk remains optimistic about future reductions. Musk's departure from DOGE marks his return to the private sector, though he will continue to advise the president.</p>
