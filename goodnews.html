          <p>New calculations suggest that Jupiter, the Solar System's largest planet, was once 2 to 2.5 times its current volume early in its history. This finding supports the bottom-up method of planet formation, known as core accretion, for gas giants. Scientists studied the orbital motions of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea and Thebe, to reconstruct the planet's early evolution.

Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested in financial markets. The proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house, but the accounts function much like typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts.
