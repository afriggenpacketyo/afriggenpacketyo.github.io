          <p>T. Rowe Price experienced a significant surge in its stock value after announcing a $1 billion deal with Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs will invest up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price common stock, aiming to acquire up to 3.5% ownership. The partnership will focus on providing individual investors, financial advisors, and retirement plan participants access to private market investment opportunities. This move comes after T. Rowe Price has faced challenges in embracing the exchange-traded fund market, and the deal aligns with President Trump's executive order promoting alternative asset access for 401(k) plans. (not investment advice) The company's shares have struggled over the years, but this partnership could be a step in the right direction for the Baltimore-based firm.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that Chinese investment in Brazil more than doubled in 2024, reaching its highest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese firms invested $4.18 billion across 39 projects, marking a 113% increase from the previous year, making Brazil the third-largest destination for Chinese capital globally. This surge positions Brazil as the leading destination for Chinese investment among emerging economies, with a shift towards smaller projects related to Brazil's industrial policy and energy transition. Brazil's diverse economy, encompassing industry, natural resources, and electricity, makes it an attractive destination for Chinese investment, as stated by the Brazil-China Business Council's research director.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a Category 4 storm, is moving west in the Pacific Ocean, heading towards Hawaii. As of Thursday morning, the storm was located approximately 1,500 miles east-southwest of Hilo and 1,700 miles from Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts a continued westward motion through Thursday night, followed by a west-northwest turn on Friday, and a gradual increase in speed as it approaches the Hawaiian Islands from the east. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, tropical-storm-force winds could impact Hawaii by Sunday, with gradual weakening expected over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Homeowners can tap into their equity through home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) at rates lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of September 4, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.22% to 8.37%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%, though these rates vary based on location, lender, and credit profile. Home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving credit line with variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period. Borrowers may also be able to deduct the interest they paid from their taxes if the product was used for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of September 4, 2025, the price of gold is $3,544.14 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold, though gold prices fluctuate constantly due to various factors. Supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies all influence the price of gold. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty and a hedge against inflation, making it an attractive investment commodity. Investors should monitor these changes to buy gold at the right time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several U.S. sheriffs and law enforcement associations have voiced concerns over the White House's efforts to recruit local deputies and officers for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Sheriffs claim that Ice's recruitment tactics, including using email lists provided by sheriffs supporting Trump's deportation agenda, are unprofessional and unethical. The sheriffs worry that the recruitment drive, aimed at hiring 10,000 new Ice officers, could strain local departments already facing staffing challenges. The Department of Homeland Security has announced a program to reimburse local agencies for the salaries of trained 287(g) officers and offer performance awards for successful location of undocumented individuals.</p>

          <p>Chinese provinces, including Zhejiang, are planning to send business delegations to the U.S. to explore trade and investment opportunities, taking advantage of a recent stabilization in U.S.-China relations. These visits, seeking to leverage the pro-business environment of local authorities in the U.S., require Beijing's approval and are facilitated by the extended pause in tariff increases. The trips aim to strengthen economic ties at the subnational level, as Beijing encourages such exchanges. These initiatives signal a cautious optimism regarding trade relations between the two countries, despite ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased modestly last week, suggesting that employers are still retaining workers despite signs of a slowing economy. Applications for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 to 237,000 for the week ending August 30, exceeding economists' expectations. The four-week average of claims also increased slightly to 231,000, while the total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits fell to 1.94 million. Weekly jobless claims, seen as a proxy for layoffs, have remained within a historically healthy range since the U.S. began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

The trailer includes suggestive imagery and hints at suppressed sexual urges, with original songs by Charli XCX and a score by Anthony Willis. The casting of Elordi as Heathcliff has sparked debate, with some criticizing the decision to cast a white actor in the role.</p>

States with higher taxes, such as New York and Minnesota, would result in lower after-tax payouts, and the data also reveals the most and least frequently drawn numbers in the last 100 drawings.
