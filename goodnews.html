          <p>Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts start-up led by CEO Siyu Huang, is developing solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, aiming to create cheaper and more convenient alternatives to conventional cars. The company achieved a milestone when Mercedes-Benz successfully tested Factorial's battery in a vehicle, marking an important step in commercializing the technology. Solid-state batteries promise faster charging, longer ranges, and improved safety compared to liquid electrolyte batteries. However, mass production remains a significant challenge, with numerous companies vying to overcome technical hurdles and bring solid-state batteries to market.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt ruling. The ruling stated that Apple cannot charge commissions on link-outs or dictate link appearances, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return after being removed in 2020 for circumventing Apple's payment system. Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject the submission. This development marks the latest chapter in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, which has significant implications for app developers and the economics of the app store ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening test, offering women an alternative to traditional Pap smears. Developed by Teal Health, the test involves vaginal swabbing to detect human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer. The at-home test is intended to improve accessibility and convenience for women who face barriers to in-person screening. Experts emphasize that while the test is a valuable tool, it should not replace regular gynecological exams and follow-up care if the test result is positive.</p>

          <p>FIFA has announced that the Women's World Cup will be expanded from 32 to 48 teams starting with the 2031 tournament. The FIFA Council unanimously approved the changes, which will result in a 12-group format and an increase from 64 to 104 matches, extending the tournament by a week. FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that the expansion will provide more nations with the opportunity to develop their women's football structures. The UK is currently the only "valid" bidder for the 2035 edition, offering England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland the chance to compete on home soil.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained after helping write an essay critical of Israel, leading to accusations that the government is suppressing free speech. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence Ozturk posed a threat beyond her opinion piece. This decision marks a victory for free speech advocates and raises concerns about the government's targeting of international students for their political views.</p>

          <p>With gold prices at elevated levels, investors can still benefit from gold's inflation-hedging and portfolio-diversifying properties by considering alternative gold investments. Options include purchasing 1-gram gold bars, investing in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and buying fractional gold coins. These approaches allow investors to acquire gold at lower entry prices, making it more accessible and affordable. Investors should limit gold to 10% or less of their portfolio for long-term success.</p>

          <p>Financial planning icon Ric Edelman argues that the classic 60-40 portfolio is no longer viable due to increasing longevity, rather than issues within the bond market itself.

Edelman emphasizes the implications of humans routinely living to 100 and beyond due to advancements in technology and biotech.</p>
