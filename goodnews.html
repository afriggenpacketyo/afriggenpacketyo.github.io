        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a move aimed at uniting progressive voters and blocking former Governor Andrew Cuomo from winning the Democratic nomination. Mamdani, a New York state assembly member, has also received the backing of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, solidifying his position as a leading figure on the left. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign, which focuses on affordable housing, rent control, free public transportation, and increased taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. The endorsement seeks to consolidate support among progressive voters and prevent a repeat of the 2021 primary, where divided progressive support led to a moderate Democrat's victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks, arguing that these women need compassion, not criminalization. While the new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services, such as time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval, it signifies a significant shift in the legal landscape. The vote reflects a growing recognition that vulnerable women and girls require care and support rather than punishment.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 4% decline following reports that the electric vehicle manufacturer is temporarily halting production of Cybertruck and Model Y models at its Austin, Texas, facility. According to Business Insider, the production stoppage is scheduled to begin on June 30 and will last for a week, to allow for maintenance on the production lines. This would mark the third such shutdown at the Austin facility within the past year.

          <p>The NBA's plan to bring more parity to the league is working, as evidenced by the Finals matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers. Recent changes to the collective bargaining agreement make it more difficult for teams to load up on multiple superstars, giving smaller market teams a better chance at competing for a championship. The "second apron," a spending limit that triggers severe punishment for teams that exceed it, discourages teams from maintaining expensive, star-studded rosters. The rise of international talent has also contributed to increased parity, with more teams than ever having world-class players on their rosters.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove all artificial food dyes from its U.S. products starting in 2027, with new products being free of these dyes immediately. Nearly 90% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. products are already free of synthetic dyes, and the company is investing in replacing them with natural colors. The decision comes after federal health officials indicated they would work with the food industry to voluntarily phase out petroleum-based food dyes by the end of next year. Some studies have linked these dyes to negative effects on children's behavior and mental health.</p>
