          <h2>Japan's Stockpiled Rice Now Available in Stores at Reduced Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 02:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, resulting in cheaper prices for consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening, highlighting the high demand for the more affordable rice. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this initiative will effectively curb rising rice prices by selling directly to retailers rather than through auctions.</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the weekend series against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe at home. Betts sustained the injury after hitting his toe on a wall, and while he will not start in any of the games, the team hopes to avoid placing him on the injured list. Manager Dave Roberts indicated that Betts' availability will depend on his pain tolerance, and veteran Miguel Rojas will fill in at shortstop in Betts' absence. Despite the injury, both Roberts and Betts are optimistic about a quick recovery.</p>

Speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports and emphasized the importance of a strong domestic steel industry for national security. While details of the deal remain unclear, Trump assured that U.S. Steel would maintain its existing blast furnaces and that the investment would create jobs and boost the American economy.
