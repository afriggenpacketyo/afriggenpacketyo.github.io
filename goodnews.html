        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that seeks to lower drug prices in the U.S. by tying them to the lowest prices paid by other nations, reviving a policy previously attempted during his first term. The order directs HHS to implement a 'most favored nation' policy, potentially impacting medications administered in doctors' offices and facing opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could hurt profits and innovation. The administration believes that drugmakers can still profit by increasing prices abroad, while patients could benefit from lower medication costs. The order also directs the FDA to consider expanding imports from other developed nations beyond Canada and directs the DOJ and FTC to aggressively enforce 'anti-competitive actions' that keep prices high in the U.S.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating efforts to address homelessness by urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property, offering a model ordinance they can adopt. While the ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it effectively makes encampments a crime, with cities deciding on the severity of enforcement. This initiative coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state housing funds to help local officials implement the template. The move reflects a shift in the Democratic party's approach to homelessness, balancing compassion with addressing the growing frustration over the persistence of encampments.</p>

Bailey believes that every balance sheet, public or private, will eventually hold bitcoin, drawing parallels to Michael Saylor's Strategy's successful transition into a bitcoin holding firm.

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a 4% jump on Monday, fueled by hopes that a temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China will stimulate economic growth and increase demand for petroleum. The agreement involves a significant reduction in tariff rates by both countries, which U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as moving away from a trade embargo. Low oil prices had previously pressured U.S. shale oil producers, who require prices around $65 per barrel to profitably drill new wells.

          <p>South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging new employment equity laws that impose strict hiring targets for non-white employees, arguing that the act violates anti-discrimination clauses in the constitution and gives the state too much regulatory power. The Employment Equity Amendment Act aims to boost the hiring of Black people and other groups in some industries, requiring companies with over 50 employees to meet sectoral targets. The ANC has criticized the DA's challenge, accusing them of hating transformation, while the US government has cited the 'racist laws' as part of the reasons to cut aid to South Africa.</p>

The agreement involves a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs, with broad-based 10% duties remaining in effect.
