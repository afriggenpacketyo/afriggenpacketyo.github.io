The company generates revenue through interchange fees from member transactions using Chime debit and credit cards, sharing these fees with partner banks. Chime reported $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with revenue growing by 32% and active members reaching 8.6 million. However, the IPO is delayed due to market volatility caused by President Trump's tariff announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

While he remains undecided, Buttigieg's appearance in Iowa, a key early voting state, and his increased public profile suggest a potential White House run.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the end of lifetime bans for Pete Rose, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, and other deceased players, making them eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.

The decision has sparked debate, with some criticizing the move and others praising it as a chance for redemption. Rose and Jackson's eligibility for Cooperstown now rests with Hall of Fame voters, reigniting discussions about integrity, legacy, and second chances in baseball.</p>

          <p>As the United States unexpectedly advances in the T20 Cricket World Cup, NPR provides a primer for new American fans unfamiliar with the sport. Cricket, similar to baseball, involves a bat and ball, but the bowler aims to hit the wicket behind the batsman. A run is scored by hitting the ball across the boundary line or running between the pitches. The World Cup features shorter, three-hour matches, unlike the classical version which can last up to five days. A super over, similar to a free kick in soccer, is used to break ties.</p>

Doctors question the rationale for a manual prostate exam at Biden's age, given guidelines against routine screening unless symptoms are present. Further evaluation could include a PSA test, MRI, or biopsy, followed by a decision on whether to treat the cancer, which may involve surgery or radiation.</p>

The song is described as a nervous breakdown set to music, with McDonald drawing on personal experiences and the influence of Black female blues singers to create a raw and emotionally resonant portrayal. The production incorporates elements like Tony Kushner's 'Angels in America' and dissonant musical arrangements to heighten the song's impact.</p>
