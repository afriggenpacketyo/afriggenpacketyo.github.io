        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill encountered significant resistance as conservatives blocked it from advancing in the House Budget Committee due to insufficient federal spending cuts. Five Republicans opposed the legislation, citing concerns over delayed Medicaid work requirements and excessive front-loaded spending, which Speaker Johnson hopes to resolve. Blue-state Republicans are also withholding support unless the cap on state and local tax deductions is raised further, creating additional hurdles for the bill's passage. Trump has urged Republicans to unite, but disagreements persist, potentially delaying the bill's progress to the House floor before Memorial Day. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures has found concerning levels of toxic heavy metals, particularly arsenic and cadmium, in rice sold across the United States. The study found arsenic in 100% of the 145 rice samples tested, with one in four exceeding the FDA's limit for infant rice cereal. The report highlights the absence of limits for rice itself, despite its widespread consumption by infants and toddlers. The USA Rice Federation acknowledges consumer concerns and pledges to work with the FDA to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets established thresholds. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report highlighting high levels of arsenic in rice brands across the U.S., experts recommend several strategies to limit exposure. These include diversifying your diet with rice alternatives like quinoa, barley, and couscous, which contain lower levels of heavy metals. Consumers are also advised to check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California typically has lower arsenic levels. Cooking rice like pasta, using a high water-to-rice ratio and draining the excess water, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>
