          <p>Alibaba's mapping service, Amap, has launched a new AI-powered ranking feature called Amap Street Stars, attracting over 40 million users on its first day. The service provides rankings and recommendations for 1.6 million establishments like restaurants and hotels, positioning Amap as a competitor to Meituan's review service, Dianping. Analysts see this as a significant move in Alibaba's super-app strategy, aiming to make Amap a primary gateway for offline local services, similar to how Taobao functions for online commerce. The integration of ranking and navigation features has been well-received by users.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The court ruled that he orchestrated a plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict, which also bars Bolsonaro from public office until 2033, has been labeled a "witch hunt" by the former leader and has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Seven of Bolsonaro's co-conspirators, including senior military officers, were also convicted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the post-World War II multilateral system falters, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, provides a crucial platform for global stability. The author contends that the United Nations is being marginalized by unilateral actions and trade wars, creating a risk of global fragmentation. The SCO is presented as a model for cooperation among countries with diverse cultures and political systems, offering an alternative to a world dominated by tariffs and sanctions, thereby promoting negotiation and adherence to international law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help parents navigate the common challenge of fussy eating, child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five key strategies. She advises letting children choose what to eat to foster autonomy, avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to promote a healthy relationship with food, and making mealtimes enjoyable to reduce stress. Additionally, she recommends being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite and involving them in food preparation to encourage adventurousness. The article emphasizes that picky eating is a normal developmental phase for many children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his eighth studio album, 'Play', Ed Sheeran moves away from the introspective themes of his recent records to create a more joyful and culturally diverse collection of songs. The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements, featuring instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. This release is seen as a response to a challenging personal period and a commercial reset after his last two albums underperformed. While some tracks are praised for their adventurousness, the review notes that much of the album retreats to his familiar, commercially safe pop formula.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, mirroring overnight gains on Wall Street where all three major U.S. indexes reached new record highs. Investor sentiment was boosted by expectations of impending interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, despite a slightly higher-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all posted gains. The rally reflects a broader global trend driven by easing inflation pressures and the anticipation of more accommodative monetary policies from central banks.</p>

          <p>Denmark has transformed its cancer care over the past 25 years, significantly improving survival rates and catching the attention of UK policymakers. The Danish model involved major investments in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and a focus on patient experience. Patients are guaranteed treatment within a set timeframe or can be treated elsewhere at the state's expense. This comprehensive approach, combining technology, accountability, and patient-centered care, provides a potential blueprint for the NHS to improve its own cancer outcomes.</p>

          <p>The fictional British rock band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel to the iconic 1984 mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap." The new film, titled "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast and director Rob Reiner, who reprises his role as filmmaker Marty DiBergi. The plot follows the hilariously inept band as they are contractually obligated to perform one last gig. The sequel features cameo appearances from real-life music legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John, continuing the franchise's blend of fiction and reality that has made it a cultural touchstone.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands can now legally take their wives' family names. The court declared the previous legislation discriminatory on the basis of gender and noted it was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the ruling. The decision, which upholds the constitutional right to equality, has sparked a mix of praise and criticism on social media.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators aiming to foster a stable, sustainable bull market rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle. Beijing's goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household income to boost consumer spending and shift wealth from the property sector. After a recent pullback moderated the market's rapid ascent, analysts believe the market is transitioning to a slower, more measured uptrend, though volatility may increase as this new phase develops.
