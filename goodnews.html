          <p>Portugal's right-of-center Democratic Alliance secured a victory in the recent snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party fell short of obtaining a majority. Party leader Lu√≠s Montenegro pledged to stimulate investment and ensure prosperity and social justice. Following the election results, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party's significant loss of seats, resulting in a near tie with the far-right Chega party. The final seat distribution remains uncertain until the overseas voter results are tallied, which could potentially shift the balance further.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached to end the New Jersey Transit strike, which halted train service for three days and disrupted commutes for thousands. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved the deal, and train service is set to resume on Tuesday, May 20. The agreement was described as fair and fiscally responsible by Governor Phil Murphy. The strike, which stemmed from disagreements over pay and work rules, had a significant impact on commuters and the regional economy, prompting calls for commuters to work from home during the disruption.</p>

          <p>GPs in England will assist the NHS in identifying undiagnosed patients affected by the contaminated blood scandal, which exposed thousands to the hepatitis C virus through blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Starting in June, patients registering with a GP practice who received a blood transfusion before 1996 will be offered a hepatitis C test. The initiative aims to address the long-term health consequences faced by those infected, as hepatitis C can cause severe liver damage if left untreated. Modern antiviral drugs can now effectively eliminate the virus for most patients.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China's yuan has the potential to compete with the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. The yuan already functions smoothly in cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. Convertibility remains a key concern for investors outside the mainland, hindering the yuan's broader adoption as a global reserve currency.</p>
