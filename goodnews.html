This would be their first in-person meeting since Rubio took office and could include discussions about the Ukraine war, where the US believes China has been supportive of Russia. Rubio, known for his hawkish stance on China, has been sanctioned by Beijing, adding a layer of complexity to any potential diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily halting President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The judge certified a class action lawsuit representing all children who would be affected by the order, stating that its implementation would cause irreparable harm. The White House criticized the ruling, vowing to fight what it called an attempt by a "rogue district court judge" to impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>The very first Hermès Birkin bag, created for and once owned by the late Jane Birkin, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction in Paris for over $10 million. This sale sets a new world record for the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was conceived in 1984 after a chance encounter between Birkin and then-Hermès leader Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight, where she expressed a need for a larger, practical purse. The sale highlights the enduring status and incredible value of the Birkin bag as a luxury icon.</p>

          <p>According to a neurologist, many people experience an increase in migraines during the summer due to various environmental factors. Triggers can include weather-related changes, increased sun exposure, and shifts between outdoor heat and indoor air conditioning. Dehydration is another critical factor that can provoke attacks. Experts recommend staying hydrated, wearing sunglasses to reduce light sensitivity, getting adequate rest, and using fragrance-free products to help prevent the onset of these severe headaches during the summer season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution for overwhelming balances. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed. Signs that this could be a beneficial route include situations where interest payments exceed principal reduction, or the long-term cost of minimum payments is higher than a settlement. While it can negatively impact a credit score, debt forgiveness can offer substantial savings for those in severe financial hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings of a $20,000 deposit in either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. CDs offer a fixed rate for their term, providing guaranteed returns. Calculations show that in most short-term scenarios (3, 6, and 12 months), a CD currently earns slightly more interest than a money market account, though the latter offers more liquidity. The choice depends on a saver's need for guaranteed returns versus flexible access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the growing phenomenon of intense fan loyalty toward certain grocery store chains like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B. This brand fanaticism is viewed as part of a broader cultural shift where consumption has replaced more traditional markers of identity and community, such as religion or civic affiliation. Anthropologists and neuroscientists suggest that these stores effectively tap into tribal instincts, allowing shoppers to signal their values and connect with like-minded people. Shopping at a particular store becomes a statement about who you are, from regional pride to health priorities.</p>
