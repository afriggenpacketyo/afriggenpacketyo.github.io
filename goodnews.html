          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 win against the Western Force in Perth, scoring a total of eight tries. Despite early resistance from the Force, who scored one try, the Lions established a 21-7 halftime lead before completely dominating the second half. The victory was comprehensive, showcasing the Lions' offensive power with players like Tomos Williams and Elliot Daly each scoring twice. However, the win was tempered by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, creating a potential concern for the team as the tour progresses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary was significantly fueled by the organized, grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. The author posits that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestine, once a political liability, has become a core strength due to shifting public opinion and the dedicated activism of students and allies. The campaign's success is attributed not just to a progressive platform but to a mobilized base of organizers who saw Mamdani as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks the Palestinian cause. His win is framed as a powerful rejection of the pro-Israel Democratic party machinery.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, are rapidly moving into the mainstream, with major corporations like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard launching or supporting their own tokens. These firms see stablecoins as a way to significantly reduce transaction fees and enable instantaneous, 24/7 payment settlements. This corporate adoption is bolstered by increasing regulatory clarity from Washington, with a bipartisan Senate bill aiming to establish rules for consumer protection and reserve requirements. The trend signifies a major shift in digital payment infrastructure, moving stablecoins from a niche crypto asset to a foundational layer for global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Journalist and public broadcasting icon Bill Moyers, who passed away at 91, is remembered for his profound impact on American media. Starting as a reporter and later serving as press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson, Moyers dedicated six decades to journalism, earning numerous accolades for his work on PBS. He was known for his probing yet compassionate interview style, engaging not only with newsmakers but also with poets, scholars, and religious leaders. His focus was on telling stories that resonated deeply with the human experience, leaving a legacy that encourages journalists to seek out what is lasting and meaningful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprising victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary is being interpreted as a major warning sign for the national Democratic Party. Polling and grassroots activism indicate widespread dissatisfaction among the party's base, particularly younger voters, who feel leaders are out of touch and not confrontational enough with President Trump. This anti-establishment energy, reminiscent of the Republican Tea Party movement, appears to be driven more by a desire for generational change and a shift in priorities than by ideology alone. The trend suggests a potential for more primary challenges against established incumbents and a forced reckoning for the party's current leadership.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP), an interracial coalition, is working to memorialize Black individuals who were victims of lynchings in the region, bringing long-forgotten histories to light. The group recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and erecting markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful past that many local residents were unaware of. The project is seen by its members as a vital form of resistance and reconciliation, especially in the current political climate where the teaching of Black history is under attack.</p>

          <p>In a historic policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and pressure from the Trump administration, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany will now meet and exceed NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target, aiming for 3.5% over the next decade. This move involves a constitutional change to allow for a $117 billion special fund for military modernization without cutting social programs. The decision marks a profound change for a country that has long maintained a posture of military restraint, signaling a new era of German leadership in European security and defense.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues against the 'respectability politics' being pushed by some conservative gay figures, asserting that the true spirit of the Pride movement is rooted in diversity and progress. The author criticizes attempts to sideline more flamboyant or transgender members of the LGBTQ+ community in an effort to gain broader acceptance, pointing out that the movement was started by drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals at Stonewall. The piece contends that the strength and beauty of the gay rights movement lie in its inclusivity and its refusal to conform to a monolithic or 'normal' identity, celebrating its history of radical and diverse champions.</p>

          <h2>Huntington Beach Voters Reject Conservative Council's Library Proposals in Rebuke of MAGA Politics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Huntington Beach, California, delivered a significant rebuke to the city's MAGA-aligned city council by overwhelmingly rejecting two controversial library-related measures. The initiatives would have created a parent review board to remove books from the children's section and opened the door to privatizing the library system. The victory for the 'Protect HB' coalition, which ran a nonpartisan campaign, is seen as a sign that even in a conservative stronghold, voters will push back against extremist overreach. The result offers a lesson in grassroots organizing and building broad coalitions to defend public institutions against ideological attacks.</p>
