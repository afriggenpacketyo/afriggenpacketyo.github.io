          <p>Chelsea secured Liam Delap from Ipswich for ¬£30m, marking the first major striker signing of the summer transfer window. Other Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Newcastle, Everton, Arsenal, and Liverpool, are actively seeking to bolster their attacking options. With the transfer window split into two periods, closing on June 10th and reopening on June 16th until September 1st, clubs have a limited time to strengthen their squads. Several strikers are expected to be in high demand over the next few months as teams look to add firepower.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often complex and costly medical needs. Many retired police dogs suffer from chronic health issues and injuries sustained during their service, leading to significant veterinary expenses. Laura Meller, who has adopted three retired police dogs, estimates she has spent ¬£12,000 caring for them. The charity warns that rising vet costs and the cost of living could deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for older dogs.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report argues that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal-fired plants, leading to potential stranded assets. The report also emphasizes the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing capabilities to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. A Chinese energy scholar, however, questions whether this vision is too expensive to be viable.</p>

The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that emphasizes engagement with local communities and encourages repeat visits. The report also highlights initiatives to remove barriers to travel, such as reluctance to take time off work, and promotes "learcation" programs for working parents.</p>

The vote offers a rare chance to make the country's bureaucracy slightly more benevolent, with cultural implications too. Meloni's government opposes the measure, hoping for low voter turnout to undermine the referendum. A yes vote would recognize the dignity and diversity of millions more should-be-compatriots, enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process.</p>
