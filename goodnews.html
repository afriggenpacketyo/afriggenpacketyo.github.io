          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy, the European Union has increased its imports of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has risen to approximately 30%, prompting the European Parliament to endorse tariffs on fertilizers from Russia and Belarus. The EU aims to gradually increase these tariffs to 50% by 2028 to encourage diversification of supply and promote the use of organic fertilizers. However, farmers' groups are urging the EU to develop affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer to avoid undermining the economic viability of farms and food security. </p>

          <p>Amazon has formed a new group within its consumer product-development division, Lab126, dedicated to agentic artificial intelligence. The team will focus on developing an agentic AI "framework" for use in robotics, enabling robots to understand and act on natural language commands. This initiative follows Amazon's earlier release of a web browser-based agent and the formation of an agentic AI group within its cloud unit. The move signals Amazon's growing investment in AI agents, which are capable of completing multistep, complex actions on a user's behalf. </p>

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, believed to be made from a sheep's appendix, is in "mint condition" and features an explicit print. The museum believes it was a "luxury souvenir" from a fancy brothel in France. The item is considered a unique piece that embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health in an era marked by fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

Alice Capsey finished with 3-41, while Linsey Smith and Lauren Filer also took two wickets each, but England's bowling attack lacked threat in the middle overs. </p>
