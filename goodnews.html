          <p>Facing the challenges of fluctuating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to manage their global supply chains. AI tools are being deployed to visualize supply chains, assess the impact of tariffs, and make quicker decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent capable of processing tariff changes, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to simulate the effects of switching parts. Despite AI's potential, experts caution it is not a 'silver bullet' and relies on the quality of available data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are embracing 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum at their jobs, motivated by a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations. This shift reflects a changing attitude towards work, with young people valuing personal fulfillment and questioning the traditional concept of lifetime commitment to a company. Experts see this trend as a positive development, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, overcoming a blown save by closer Tanner Scott. The game was further complicated by a rain delay that shortened Clayton Kershaw's start and strained the already depleted pitching staff. Teoscar Hern√°ndez delivered the game-winning RBI double in the 13th, securing the victory for the Dodgers. Despite the win, the Dodgers' pitching depth remains a concern as they navigate a challenging stretch against playoff-contending teams.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is preparing to govern Lancashire County Council, having secured a significant majority in recent local elections. The party, relatively new to local government, is focused on scrutinizing the council's budget and addressing legacy issues. While some new councillors bring experience from the 'real world,' others are seasoned politicians who defected from other parties. The party's priorities include reversing net-zero initiatives and challenging diversity and inclusion policies, facing scrutiny as they transition from opposition to governance.</p>

          <p>China has officially greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal linking the resource-rich Jiangxi province to the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang. This project, estimated to cost 320 billion yuan (US$44.4 billion), is part of a broader effort to expand China's inland waterway network. Once completed, the canal will facilitate the transportation of goods, particularly rare earth and copper reserves, and promote economic integration between inland and coastal regions. The canal is planned to accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>
