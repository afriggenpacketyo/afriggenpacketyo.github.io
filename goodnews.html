          <p>Tesla has applied to operate its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which has been active there since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, that has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny. Tesla's approach relies heavily on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, a distinction the company believes will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable. The Arizona Department of Transportation is expected to make a decision on the application by the end of July.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe.com has identified southern cities as offering the best overall value for renters in the United States. The study ranked 150 cities based on metrics like cost of living, housing quality, and local economy, with McKinney, Texas, taking the top spot. Other high-ranking southern cities included Sarasota, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, which scored well for their affordability and strong job growth. The findings highlight a trend of renters finding more favorable conditions in the South compared to more expensive coastal markets.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK will return some migrants who arrive in small boats to France. In exchange, the UK will accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers from France, with priority given to those with links to the UK. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers and deter dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand. The company announced it plans to absorb some of the financial impact from higher U.S. tariffs on goods from Southeast Asia, where much of its manufacturing is based. Levi's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong direct-to-consumer sales and growth in its women's apparel category. The positive outlook comes despite uncertainty surrounding President Trump's evolving trade policies, which could still affect the company's costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Ramsey argued that renting long-term would make her a "victim of the real estate market" due to unpredictable rent increases over time. Instead, he suggested she consider downsizing to a condo, which would reduce maintenance responsibilities while allowing her to retain the financial benefits of homeownership and build equity. The advice highlights the ongoing debate over renting versus owning for those nearing retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
