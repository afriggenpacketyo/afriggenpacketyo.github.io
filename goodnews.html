          <p>South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to increase their share of the global shipbuilding market as the United States applies pressure on China's industry. South Korea's new presidential administration has pledged significant support for its shipbuilding sector, which it describes as being in a major crisis. The new government's policies aim to foster the development of advanced vessels, including autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced training, digitalization, and automation. This strategic push is intended to re-establish the nation as a world-leading maritime power.</p>

          <p>Despite a hard-fought loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon, Emma Raducanu's performance is being viewed as a significant step forward in her career. The British player demonstrated immense fight and skill, pushing the three-time major champion in a close two-set match. Raducanu expressed that the performance gives her confidence, as she feels she is closing the gap with the sport's top players, a sentiment echoed by Sabalenka who predicted a swift return to the top 10 for her opponent.

          <h2>Prada Faces Accusations of Cultural Appropriation Over Design Resembling Indian Sandals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:12:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing backlash from artisans in Kolhapur, India, for releasing a line of footwear that strongly resembles the traditional Kolhapuri sandals without acknowledging their origin. The incident has sparked a debate on cultural appropriation, with local artisans and industry groups demanding recognition and a share of the profits. For generations, these leather sandals have been handcrafted by a specific community for modest prices, and the controversy highlights the struggle of traditional craftspeople against global fashion giants. Prada has since acknowledged the sandals' roots and is reportedly in talks with an Indian trade association.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major, Previously Underestimated Role in Storing Ocean Carbon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in the spring, growing fat before migrating deep into the Antarctic Ocean for the winter. By burning this fat far below the surface, they sequester an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars. This discovery forces a significant reassessment of the Southern Ocean's capacity for carbon storage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises that some common-looking pennies could be worth thousands, or even over a million, dollars to collectors due to rare minting errors. Specific examples include the 1943 copper-alloy Lincoln cent and the 1958 "double die" penny, one of which recently sold for $1.136 million. These errors, such as being struck from the wrong material or having a doubled image, make the coins exceptionally rare. Experts suggest that while finding such a coin is a matter of chance, people should look closely at their change for these valuable anomalies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, highlighting a phenomenon that is not uncommon among the species. The chick was one of two eggs laid by another penguin pair; zoo experts distributed the eggs to give both chicks a better chance of survival. Humboldt penguins are a vulnerable species, and the 10 chicks hatched at the zoo this year are a vital part of an international conservation breeding program. The new parents are sharing duties, creating a special meal from fish to feed their young.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks shares five "toxic" foods he no longer feeds his children to promote long-term health.

He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends whole-food alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and air-fried vegetables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, describing it as a bloody civil war born from deep division, not unlike the political turmoil of today. He argues that the nation is held together by the ideas in its founding documents, like the Declaration of Independence, and that understanding the founders' flaws makes their achievements more accessible and powerful. Burns champions a complex, inclusive view of history that tells stories from the "top down" and "bottom up," rejecting sanitized narratives. He stresses that a citizen's duty is lifelong learning.</p>
