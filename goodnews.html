          <h2>Experimental Blood Test Shows Potential for Early Cancer Detection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 16:21:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed an advanced method for detecting cancer using an experimental blood test. The study, published in Cancer Discovery, found that genetic material shed by tumors can be detected in the bloodstream up to three years before a cancer diagnosis. Researchers analyzed plasma samples from participants, identifying tumor-derived mutations in blood samples collected years prior to diagnosis. The lead author noted that earlier detection allows for earlier intervention and potentially more curable tumors, while senior authors emphasized the promise of multi-cancer early detection tests and the need to determine appropriate clinical follow-up.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate tax bill includes a provision for "Trump accounts," offering a tax incentive similar to 529 college savings plans. The federal government will deposit $1,000 into these accounts for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028, provided they are U.S. citizens at birth and both parents have Social Security numbers. The accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, and qualified withdrawals are taxed as long-term capital gains. Some experts argue the accounts are overly complicated, making it harder to reach lower-income families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of their tax cut package, aiming to fulfill President Trump's "no tax on tips" pledge. The Senate measure, structured as a deduction on qualified tips, is similar to a House version but includes key differences. The Senate bill caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000. Tax experts suggest the tax break wouldn't benefit many workers.

          <p>The Lumbee tribe, the largest east of the Mississippi, has faced federal recognition denial for almost a century and a half. However, they are now receiving significant political attention, with President Trump signing a memorandum to help them gain full federal recognition. Both Donald Trump Jr. and Bill Clinton campaigned in Pembroke, the seat of the tribal government, showing their support for the tribe. The House of Representatives passed the Lumbee Fairness Act, but it stalled in the Senate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines five medical debt relief options, including negotiating with providers, applying for hospital financial assistance, using a medical bill advocate, enrolling in debt consolidation or management, and considering debt settlement. Negotiating with providers can lead to lower bills or payment plans, while financial assistance programs may reduce or forgive debt for low-income patients. Medical bill advocates identify errors in billing, and debt consolidation can streamline payments. Debt settlement should be a last resort due to potential credit score damage.
