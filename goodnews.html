        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but exceeding forecasters' expectations of 0.1%. The growth was primarily driven by the services and construction sectors, providing what Chancellor Rachel Reeves called "positive" news for an economy that has felt stagnant. However, critics point to a sharp fall in business investment and a dip in household spending as signs of underlying weakness. Despite the better-than-expected performance, some economists express doubt that this pace can be maintained amid global uncertainty and potential future tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with grotesque, horn-like growths, causing public concern, but scientists assure there is no reason to panic. The growths are caused by the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that spreads among rabbits via fleas and ticks but cannot infect humans or other animals. The virus, which likely inspired the myth of the jackalope, typically resolves on its own as the rabbit's immune system fights it off. The growths are only dangerous if they interfere with a rabbit's ability to see or eat, and officials note it is not uncommon to see such cases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from a leader at Justice Democrats argues that for the Democratic party to succeed in 2026 and 2028, it must embrace a robust primary process that challenges corporate-backed incumbents. The author contends that voters are disaffected because they see the party as beholden to special interests and failing to fight for working-class issues with urgency. The path forward, according to the article, is to support a new generation of unbought, progressive leaders who are not afraid to confront powerful lobbies like AIPAC. True victory requires moral courage and solidarity, not silence, to inspire an electorate that wants leaders to vote for, not just against.</p>

          <p>Following a devastating fire in January that destroyed the Altadena home and studio of the late, influential artist John Outterbridge, his daughter Tami is leading a unique salvage project. With the help of a community of artists who were friends and colleagues of her father, she has been excavating the ashes to recover remnants of his work and archive. The project, named "Diggin' Bridge," involves these artists creating new pieces from the salvaged materials as a tribute to Outterbridge's legacy of assemblage art. Despite the immense loss, the collaborative effort has become a testament to the artist's community spirit and his philosophy of finding value in discarded objects.</p>

          <p>A new documentary series revisits a seminal 1980 photograph of seven rebellious Los Angeles architects, including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne, who reshaped American architecture from their base in Venice Beach. The series, "Rebel Architects," reunites four of the now-elderly architects to reflect on their early careers, the scrappy creative energy of 1970s Venice, and how their work evolved. They discuss a time of immense freedom and collaboration with artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, contrasting it with today's more constrained environment. The documentary explores their legacy, rivalries, and the bittersweet loss of that unique, norm-busting cultural moment in L.A. history.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, who create cinematics and other narrative content, have voted to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. This move is part of a growing labor movement within the video game industry, driven by concerns over job insecurity, crunch hours, and workplace harassment. The unionization was facilitated by a neutrality agreement from parent company Microsoft, which has allowed thousands of its gaming employees to organize more easily. Workers cited frequent layoffs and a lack of remote work options as key frustrations that motivated their decision to form the union.</p>

          <p>The FBI has returned a 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to the Mexican government. Penned in 1527, the document details payments for supplies for his expeditions and is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives decades ago. The page was discovered in the U.S. after the Mexican government requested assistance from the FBI's art crime team in 2024. No one will be prosecuted for the theft as the document had changed hands multiple times, but the FBI affirmed its commitment to countering the trafficking of cultural artifacts and locating the remaining missing pages.</p>

          <p>German football champion Bayern Munich has ended its controversial sponsorship deal with Rwanda's government tourist board, which featured "Visit Rwanda" on its branding. The club cited a "strategic evolution" for the change, though the decision follows significant pressure from fans and human rights activists concerned about Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in DR Congo. Instead of the branding deal, Bayern will now focus on a partnership for football development through its youth academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the initial deal was part of a broader strategy for European clubs to expand into the African market.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps is an Effective Target for Health Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While 10,000 steps a day is a popular fitness goal, a comprehensive review of scientific data suggests that aiming for around 7,000 steps provides significant health benefits with diminishing returns beyond that number. A new study in The Lancet Public Health found that taking 7,000 steps daily was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking just 2,000 steps. It also correlated with lower risks of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Researchers emphasize that while more steps are not harmful, 7,000 can be a more realistic and highly effective target for people struggling to be more active.</p>
