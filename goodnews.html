          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The investigation found that corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials were sent to local landfills not equipped to handle them. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative and had already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs prior to the settlement. The payment includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funds for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave system in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The find was part of the Ingleborough Cave Archaeology Project, which also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These discoveries, made in partnership with local cave explorers, provide new insights into the prehistoric farming and rituals of people who lived in the region thousands of years ago.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a post on Truth Social, Trump endorsed the ad, which had drawn some online criticism, and contrasted it with what he termed "woke" advertising from other brands. The president's comments fueled a rally for the company's stock, which had previously been facing financial challenges, including withdrawn guidance and a write-off of merchandise due to slow sales.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to announce an expedited plan to develop and build a nuclear reactor on the moon's surface. The directive for Fission Surface Power aims to advance a critical technology essential for a future lunar economy and eventual missions to Mars. This move is also framed as a national security imperative, intended to counter a joint effort by China and Russia to place their own reactor on the moon by the mid-2030s. The plan gives NASA a more definitive timeline for the ambitious project.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This encouraging trend is directly linked to a 62% rise in screenings within this age group after the recommended screening age was lowered to 45. Researchers called the findings promising news, as earlier detection greatly improves treatment outcomes. However, the article also notes that screening rates remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's recent resilience and rebound are primarily due to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies. He argued that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the market was buoyed by impressive results from firms like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Cramer pointed to their multiple revenue streams, tight expense management, and dominant market positions as key factors that allow them to weather broader economic concerns and lead the market upward.

          <p>New, tighter gun control measures coming into law in the UK have been welcomed by Emma Ambler, who has campaigned for reform since her twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held weapon in 2020.

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has spent over $5 million in the last six months fighting the Trump administration but has saved the state an estimated $170 billion. He claimed a return of $33,600 for every dollar spent, primarily from a successful lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze federal funding. The funds were allocated by the state legislature specifically to challenge the administration on issues like healthcare, education, and environmental policy.

          <p>The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued new advice for the NHS on managing patients who stop taking obesity jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro. The guidance recommends at least a year of structured check-ups and support to help people maintain their weight loss, as studies show many regain weight after treatment ends. The advice emphasizes the importance of building long-term behavioral habits, such as healthy eating and physical activity, to ensure the positive changes are sustainable.</p>
