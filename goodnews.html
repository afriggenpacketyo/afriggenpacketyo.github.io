        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following its recent bankruptcy filing, the tween jewelry and accessories retailer Claire's has agreed to sell the majority of its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the move is a strategic effort to maximize the value of the company for its stakeholders during its restructuring. As part of the agreement, Claire's will pause the liquidation process at most of its stores, a decision expected to provide significant benefits. The company has been struggling under the weight of nearly $500 million in debt and an increasingly competitive retail environment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a controversial Texas law that would have required every public school classroom in the state to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Court Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, Senate Bill 10, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, which mandate a separation of church and state. The lawsuit was filed by a diverse group of families who argued the mandate infringes on their right to direct their children's religious upbringing. While civil liberties groups praised the decision, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has vowed to appeal the ruling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has called on the UK government to establish a proactive national strategy for stablecoins. In an open letter to the Finance Minister, they argue that the UK risks falling behind the U.S. and becoming a "rule-taker" if it doesn't embrace the technology responsibly. The firms contend that the current regulatory approach, which defines stablecoins as crypto-assets rather than focusing on their function, is limiting growth. They believe a coordinated strategy would bolster the UK's position as a global financial hub and support demand for government bonds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's exceeded Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, buoyed by increased demand for smaller home projects. Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion to strengthen its business with professional contractors. Despite the positive results, CEO Marvin Ellison noted that demand for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates, and he anticipates a significant pickup in activity only when rates fall below 6%. The company revised its full-year sales forecast upward to reflect its recent pro-focused acquisitions, signaling confidence in its strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A booming industry has emerged around IT asset disposition (ITAD), focusing on securely erasing data from discarded devices like smartphones, computers, and servers. With global e-waste projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030, the risk of data breaches from improperly handled equipment is rising significantly. ITAD providers use methods like physical destruction, specialized software, and degaussing to ensure data is unrecoverable for corporate and consumer clients. The article highlights that simply performing a factory reset is often insufficient, making professional data erasure a critical component of both cybersecurity and environmental responsibility in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Google has officially announced its new Pixel 10 series of smartphones, with a heavy emphasis on its integrated Gemini artificial intelligence assistant. The lineup includes the standard Pixel 10, a Pixel 10 Pro, and a folding model, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. New AI features like "Magic Cue" are designed to anticipate user needs by proactively surfacing relevant information based on their current context. The launch positions Google to compete directly with Apple's upcoming iPhone release, especially as Google's Gemini models are considered by some to be more advanced than Apple's current AI offerings, setting the stage for a new battleground in smartphone innovation.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues AI Conversations Will Create a More Valuable Era for Google and Publishers</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while generative AI is reducing traditional search traffic to publishers, it is simultaneously creating a new, more valuable form of interaction: high-value conversations. The author posits that while general search clicks may decline, complex user queries about travel, health, or finance within AI models like Google's Gemini represent significant commercial opportunities. These detailed conversations could be worth far more to advertisers than a simple click, transforming Google's revenue model. The article suggests that trusted publishers can also leverage this shift by hosting their own expert-driven AI conversations, moving from a pageview model to one based on relationship-driven value.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent cooling in rates from their peak, Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts continue to offer attractive and secure returns for savers with significant cash reserves. The article breaks down the potential earnings on a $125,000 deposit across various terms, from a 3-month CD yielding approximately $1,323 to a 5-year CD generating around $28,550 at current top rates. It highlights that CDs provide complete predictability in a volatile market, making them a compelling option for conservative investors. The key is to align the CD term with one's financial goals, balancing the need for liquidity with the desire for higher, guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, signaling rapid and explosive growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Despite this significant financial milestone, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs and processing power to train and run its advanced AI models. To address this critical bottleneck, OpenAI is pursuing major infrastructure projects like Stargate and diversifying its partnerships beyond Microsoft to include Oracle and Coreweave. The company's CEO recently stated they expect to spend trillions on datacenters to meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop "Superfood" Supplement to Protect Honeybee Populations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 11:03:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a "superfood" supplement that could help save honeybees from existential threats like climate change and habitat loss. The specially formulated food provides all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly when natural pollen is scarce. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that successfully reached adulthood. This breakthrough, which involved engineering a yeast to produce vital lipids called sterols, offers a promising way to bolster the health of bee populations, which are crucial for pollinating a majority of global food crops.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their GCSE and other Level 2 qualification results on Thursday, marking a significant milestone in their education. The pass rate is expected to be broadly similar to last year, following a return to pre-pandemic grading standards. However, students may face increased competition for sixth form college placements due to a demographic increase in 16-year-olds and the growing popularity of these institutions. This cohort of students experienced significant disruption to their education, having started secondary school during the COVID-19 lockdowns, adding to the anticipation surrounding their results.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. is launching a massive advertising campaign to promote its new direct-to-consumer ESPN streaming app, which becomes available without a cable subscription for the first time. The aggressive campaign will heavily target commuters in major markets like Los Angeles and New York with branded vehicles, subway takeovers, and digital billboards. Priced at $29.99 per month, the service is a strategic response to cord-cutting, which has eroded the number of households receiving ESPN through traditional pay-TV. The app will also feature personalized "SportsCenter" highlights generated by artificial intelligence to enhance user experience.</p>
