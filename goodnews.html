          <p>NHS England is set to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will offer walk-in services and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model, Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health expresses skepticism, calling for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the high number of people waiting over 12 hours in A&E, underscoring the need for improved mental health support.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are putting their retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures amid a slowing economy. They are too focused on current circumstances to prioritize retirement planning. The Chinese government has been urging young people to start planning early for retirement due to the country's rapidly aging population and strained pension system. However, many young workers are more concerned with living well in the present rather than worrying about the distant future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," opting to prioritize work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. This trend contrasts sharply with previous generations known for their unwavering loyalty and long hours. The primary motivation for quiet quitting is the desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation. Factors contributing to this shift include changing attitudes towards work, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and a decline in traditional job security and benefits. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in 13 innings after overcoming a blown save and weather delays, but the victory came at a cost to their already strained pitching staff.

Despite the challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the usage concerns for his overworked bullpen. </p>
