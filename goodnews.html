        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have officially reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding an impending tariff deadline that threatened to escalate economic tensions. The deal, announced following discussions between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, establishes a new 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S. This rate represents a compromise, as it is lower than the 30% previously threatened by the U.S. but higher than the EU's initial goal. As part of the comprehensive agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy, aiming to create stability and rebalance the transatlantic trade relationship.

          <p>England's women's national football team has won the Euro 2025 final, defeating Spain in a dramatic penalty shootout. The decisive moment came from Chloe Kelly, who not only scored the winning penalty but also provided the crucial assist for the equalizing goal that sent the match into extra time. This victory marks a successful defense of the title for the Lionesses, who also won the tournament in 2022. According to a fan poll conducted by BBC Sport after the match, Kelly received the highest player rating for her impactful performance coming off the bench. The win solidifies England's position at the top of European women's football.</p>

          <h2>New Humanoid Robot Can Autonomously Swap Its Own Battery for Continuous Operation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology company UBTech has developed a new humanoid robot, the Walker S2, capable of swapping its own battery without human assistance, enabling nearly 24/7 operation. When its power runs low, the robot navigates to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fully charged one in a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation is designed to significantly enhance productivity in manufacturing environments, with the robot already being tested in car factories. The development is part of China's broader investment in robotics and AI, aiming to lead the next era of automated manufacturing and change the dynamics of the global workplace.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers offensive lineman Rashawn Slater has signed a four-year, $114-million contract extension, making him one of the highest-paid players at his position. The deal reportedly includes $92 million in guaranteed money, the most ever for an NFL offensive lineman. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Slater is considered a cornerstone of the team's offense, tasked with protecting quarterback Justin Herbert's blindside. The extension solidifies a key piece of the Chargers' offensive line as the team, under new coach Jim Harbaugh, continues to build its roster ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

His victory marks a remarkable year in which he also became the reigning world road champion, a feat not achieved by a Tour winner since 1990. The win places him alongside cycling legend Chris Froome with four titles, further cementing his legacy as one of the greatest cyclists of the modern era.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team achieved a remarkable draw in the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, batting for over five sessions to keep the series alive.

A crucial dropped catch by Joe Root proved to be a turning point, allowing India to build an unbreakable partnership. The result means England maintains a 2-1 series lead heading into the final Test, with both teams facing fatigue and potential player changes after the grueling match.</p>
