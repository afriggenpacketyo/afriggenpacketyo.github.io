          <p>AMD reported strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents and revenue of $7.44 billion. Despite these positive results, AMD anticipates a $700 million revenue hit in the current quarter due to U.S. export controls on AI chips to China, with a total expected loss of $1.5 billion through the third quarter. CEO Lisa Su highlighted that strong demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs in the data center segment is offsetting these regulatory headwinds, as AMD's chips are being utilized for AI training and deployment by major model developers. The company's Client and Gaming segment also saw growth, driven by laptop and PC chip sales, though gaming revenue declined due to lower console chip sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rivian beat first-quarter expectations but adjusted its 2025 delivery and capital spending targets due to the impact of tariffs. The electric vehicle manufacturer expects additional expenses of a couple thousand dollars per vehicle due to tariffs on imported auto parts. Rivian now forecasts deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 units and capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year, benefiting from Volkswagen Group's investment following the formation of their joint venture.</p>

          <p>Starting May 7th, the U.S. government will require travelers to present a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints for domestic flights. The change, intended to enhance security, has been delayed for years. A Real ID is a state-issued driver's license or ID card marked with a star. While Real IDs are sufficient for domestic flights, passports are still required for international travel.

He also directed the Army to implement a transformation strategy, streamline its force structure, and modernize inefficient defense contracts. Concerns have been raised about whether the cuts will be based on merit or political considerations, especially given Hegseth's past dismissals of military leaders.</p>

          <p>With Mother's Day approaching, prices for flowers may be higher due to tariffs enacted by President Trump.

About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers. Consumers may just need to be a little more flexible about what types of flowers they buy, but they can still get quality bouquets.</p>
