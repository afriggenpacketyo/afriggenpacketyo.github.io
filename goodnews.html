          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm increased by 15% in extended trading following a strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported earnings per share of 20 cents against an estimated 11 cents, and revenue of $876 million, exceeding the projected $837 million. Affirm achieved operating income profitability and saw its gross merchandise volume grow by 43% year-over-year. The positive results come amid growing competition in the e-commerce sector and a recent shift by partner Walmart to a rival service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to explain the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark helps address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. He also highlighted the acquisition of two future first-round draft picks as valuable assets for building long-term strength. Jones confirmed he made Parsons a record-setting contract offer in April but asserted the final decision to trade was a consensus among the front office and coaching staff.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Friday, diverging from gains seen on Wall Street as investors analyzed new economic data from Japan. Tokyo's core consumer price index, a key inflation indicator, rose 2.5% in August, slowing from the previous month but remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. In response, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes both declined slightly. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 posted modest gains, reflecting varied investor sentiment across the region's major economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to uncover the genetic secrets behind its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, involving The Woodland Trust, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive centuries of threats like climate change and disease. Researchers will analyze the genomes of about 50 ancient oaks across the UK. The findings could be crucial for selecting the most robust trees for future planting, helping to restore Britain's depleted woodlands and support the vast ecosystems that depend on these iconic trees.</p>

WDIA made history in 1948 as the first radio station in the United States with an all-Black format, providing not just music but also essential news and information ignored by mainstream outlets. The station played a crucial role in the Civil Rights movement and spearheaded the fundraising effort that saved the Lorraine Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum.

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact on families, as chickenpox is estimated to cause £24 million in lost income annually from parents taking time off work.</p>

In an interview, he stated that the city's future success hinges on the speed at which its regulators act to embrace Web3 technologies and expand their framework. Zhao suggested an immediate improvement would be to allow licensed exchanges to trade a wider range of cryptocurrencies beyond the current four permitted tokens. He praised the Hong Kong government for showing a clear intention to support the industry. (not investment advice)</p>
