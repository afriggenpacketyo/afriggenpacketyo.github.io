          <h2>Man's Snake Venom Injections Lead to Development of 'Unparalleled' Antivenom</h2>

          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who has been deliberately injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests, offering a potential universal antivenom. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's antibodies target common elements in toxins, and his motivation was to develop better therapies for victims of snakebites worldwide, which cause up to 140,000 deaths annually. The new antivenom cocktail has shown success in protecting mice against fatal doses from most of the deadliest snakes.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to stabilize the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency, marking its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially leading to further capital inflow into Hong Kong. The HKMA stated it will closely monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and centralizing political power under the Communist Party. Led by party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, closing state-run media outlets, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes are expected to streamline bureaucracy and redirect resources toward economic development, while also addressing dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign. Some analysts believe that these measures also strengthen To Lam's position ahead of the 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>
