          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his military received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. The move is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine or join Western sanctions against Russia. This development suggests a potential shift in Israeli policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. In other news, the International Paralympic Committee voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus, a decision Ukraine's Sports Minister denounced as a betrayal of Olympic values. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck a key Russian oil pumping station.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its publication, Judy Blume's novel "Forever" is remembered as a cultural touchstone that offered a rare and honest depiction of female sexuality and teen anxieties. The article reflects on how such young adult literature serves as a vital tool for self-discovery, allowing young readers to see their own complex desires and fears validated in a way that popular culture often avoids. For many, obtaining and sharing a copy of the book was a rite of passage, providing an invitation to imagine future possibilities and feel understood. The piece explores the unique power of art discovered during adolescence to shape personal understanding and provide a sense of connection.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Starting her career in the 1960s, a time when the industry was dominated by white men, she broke significant barriers and became a trusted news figure in the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout her career, she covered major historical events, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a courageous and graceful mentor who opened doors for a generation of diverse journalists.</p>

This asset class, which has seen rapid growth, was historically available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. Unlike traditional private credit investments that involve lockups and high fees, this ETF offers a liquid vehicle providing indirect exposure through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs). The fund aims to capitalize on private credit's potential to provide significant income streams, making it a more accessible tool for a broader range of portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

Hardy also served with distinction in the Korean and Vietnam Wars and later worked on advanced military communication systems. In retirement, he became a dedicated champion of the Tuskegee Airmen's legacy, which was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan states that this income allows for an upper-middle-class lifestyle in Vietnam, a sharp contrast to the financial pressures he felt in the United States, where he believed he was constantly in "survival mode." He describes Vietnam as a safe and calm environment that allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than monetary stress, and he has no plans to return to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which prompted CCO to divest its European and Latin American assets to become a U.S.-focused company. Despite these strategic changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, and it still carries significant debt. Anson Funds argues that a sale is now the most feasible and valuable path forward, as the streamlined company could attract buyers like JCDecaux or Lamar, or private equity firms showing interest in the sector.

Recently, Fading West demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the wildfires in Lahaina, Maui. By applying manufacturing principles to home construction, the company aims to make homeownership more attainable for essential workers and others priced out of the current market, disrupting the traditional homebuilding industry.</p>

          <p>Relationship experts provide advice for interracial couples on how to navigate complex conversations about race, culture, and family dynamics. They emphasize the importance of openly discussing differences rather than ignoring them, which helps in understanding how power dynamics can affect the relationship. Key conversations include acknowledging cultural distinctions, co-creating a new blended family culture, and negotiating compromises on traditions and beliefs. Another crucial aspect is developing a unified plan for supporting each other when facing biases from family or the community, ensuring that both partners feel respected and united against external pressures.</p>

          <p>Effectively managing workplace conflicts is a key skill for professional success, and communication experts suggest memorizing specific phrases can help navigate awkward situations. To initiate a difficult conversation, phrases like "I'm seeking clarity" can reduce defensiveness. When approached with a problem, asking "What does success look like?" helps align goals before offering solutions. During a disagreement, validating the other person's perspective with statements such as "It sounds like what's most important to you is..." can de-escalate tension. Mastering these techniques can build a reputation as a calm, accountable problem-solver, thereby increasing influence and collaboration.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and documentarian known for his unconventional television interviews, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew, Troller fled the Nazis in his youth, emigrated to the U.S., and later returned to Europe as a GI, serving as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He settled in Paris and became a prominent correspondent for German television, gaining fame for his insightful and subjective interview show "Personenbeschreibung," where he spoke with luminaries like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" from the trauma of the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to act as sophisticated matchmakers, aiming to combat user burnout from endless swiping. These new systems promise to connect people based on deeper values and goals rather than superficial profiles. However, the article expresses skepticism, noting that past attempts at algorithmic matchmaking have shown limited success, as romantic chemistry remains largely mysterious and unpredictable. While AI may refine the process, the fundamental challenge persists: no algorithm can truly anticipate the complex, often random spark of human connection, which can only be tested through real-life interaction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is developing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react and prevent runway collisions. The technology was demonstrated by recreating recent near-disasters, showing how automated warnings like "Traffic on runway!" could provide critical extra seconds for pilots to abort a landing or takeoff. This development comes in response to a rise in serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which peaked in 2023. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and airlines like Southwest and Alaska have embraced similar technologies to add another layer of safety in increasingly congested airports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece revisits the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a town with many Holocaust survivors, to reflect on the nature of free speech today. The author recalls the pain the case caused survivors but quotes the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right, David Goldberger, who argued his real client was the First Amendment. Goldberger maintained that if speech is denied because it's offensive, officials gain the power to suppress any speech they dislike. The article concludes by suggesting that the principle that free speech must be protected even when we disagree with it is a vital concept for today's divided times.</p>
