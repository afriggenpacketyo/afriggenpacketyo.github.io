        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from several Chinese institutions have created a "digital embryo," a high-resolution spatiotemporal atlas of early human organogenesis. This model provides an unprecedented tool for understanding the complex processes of cell differentiation and organ formation during the critical early stages of embryonic development. The scientists state that this digital map helps decode how a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types and can provide insights into the origins of developmental defects and diseases. The research aims to illuminate how abnormalities during this period can lead to serious health conditions later in life.</p>

          <p>At a global forum in Bangkok, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay called for international cooperation between governments, businesses, and civil society to establish ethical standards for artificial intelligence.

Notably, major AI companies from both the US and China were absent from the forum, which was attended primarily by representatives from Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.

          <p>During the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to become a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology stated that China will not achieve true wealth unless it transitions from its production-focused model. She warned that China's export-heavy economy could create friction with global trading partners and suggested that local governments should measure success based on consumption metrics. The consensus was that fostering internal consumption, particularly in the services sector, is crucial for China's long-term economic harmony and prosperity.</p>

          <p>The Chinese city of Chongqing is experiencing a significant tourism boom from Southeast Asia, largely fueled by viral social media clips showcasing its "cyberpunk" architecture and unique urban landscape. Online travel platforms report a more than sixfold increase in flight bookings from the region, as young travelers are drawn to sights like monorails passing through buildings. This trend is amplified by the fact that a majority of millennial and Gen Z travelers use platforms like TikTok and Douyin for holiday planning. Improved transportation, diverse activities, and efficient crowd control have also contributed to the city's growing appeal.</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks experienced a sharp climb on Friday morning, with the Nikkei 225 index rising above the 40,000 level for the first time in five months. The surge was driven by easing concerns over U.S. trade policy, following a White House announcement that President Trump could extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. The market was also buoyed by gains in the U.S. Nasdaq index, which boosted heavyweight semiconductor stocks, and by reduced tensions in the Middle East. The positive sentiment led to the Japanese yen, a safe-haven asset, being sold off against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

The remarks came as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, seeking concessions on the higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs on about 60 trading partners, but not the baseline 10% duty on all imports.</p>
