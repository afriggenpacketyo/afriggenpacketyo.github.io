          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has made history by becoming the youngest female chess player ever to defeat a grandmaster. She achieved the record during the final round of the British Chess Championships, beating 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells. Sivanandan, who only started playing during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has been hailed as a trailblazing prodigy in a sport traditionally dominated by men. Chess experts believe she is on a path to becoming a grandmaster herself and could potentially become a future world champion.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin is being held in Alaska, a location with deep historical ties to both the U.S. and Russia. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska became a strategic military outpost during the Cold War. Today, its proximity to Russia makes it a geographically convenient meeting point for the two leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. The state's unique history as a former Russian territory and a current U.S. defensive line adds a layer of symbolism to the high-stakes diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing advanced AI to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks in complex, human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training robots like "Ruby" to handle everyday chores by capturing data from humans performing the same tasks. Using sensors to measure motion and force, researchers can teach the machines nuanced actions, such as how tightly to grip an object. The goal is to create safe, adaptable robots that can function beyond repetitive industrial settings and one day assist in homes and medical facilities.</p>

The company reported strong earnings, lifted by soaring demand for AI infrastructure, with orders from large-scale customers more than doubling its original targets. CFO Mark Patterson stated that while the enterprise AI market is still nascent, it represents a larger long-term opportunity. Cisco is positioning itself to help companies upgrade their networking and security systems to meet the new demands of AI technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The "shop-in-shop" arrangement, which began in 2021, will conclude in August 2026. The partnership was initially touted as a way to drive store traffic and boost Target's beauty sales. The dissolution of the deal is seen as a potential setback for Target, which has been struggling with flat sales and declining store traffic, and will now have to re-evaluate its beauty strategy.</p>

          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute. The gift is reported to be the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution. The funds will be used to advance a new scientific approach to cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, building on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising. This philanthropic contribution aims to accelerate the vision of creating revolutionary outcomes in the fight against cancer.</p>

          <p>Kristie Colton, a 28-year-old woman with a degenerative eye disease, is preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro with two friends acting as her guides. Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age nine, Colton has refused to let her gradual vision loss limit her, having previously learned to snowboard and completed the Boston Marathon. She and her friends established a nonprofit, the Vorden Initiative, to train sighted individuals as athletic guides for the blind. The Kilimanjaro ascent is her latest challenge, joining a group of eleven blind climbers on the expedition to the nearly 20,000-foot peak.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, reaching a market valuation of over $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been its government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's focus on AI has also attracted a wave of retail investors, pushing its valuation to levels that far exceed peers with much higher revenues. Despite concerns about its international commercial growth, Palantir's leadership remains confident in its strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are expected to see a third consecutive year of declining sales, with total estimates between $367 million and $409 million. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as baby boomer collectors age out and are replaced by younger buyers who prefer newer supercars from the 1980s and beyond. This has led to an oversupply and falling prices for older classics, while demand for modern exotics is skyrocketing. The changing tastes are reshaping the collectible car market, with more high-end sales moving to the private market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the UK have outperformed girls in achieving the top A* and A grades in A-level exams. Boys secured 28.4% of top grades compared to 28.2% for girls, reversing a long-standing trend. Experts suggest a significant factor is the growing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by a higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While the margins are slim, the shift has prompted discussion about subject choices, gender-based academic trends, and the support provided to students in the education system.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a schoolgirl from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "Girls of the Year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket to help homeless people stay warm. She designed the device at age 12, and engineering firm Thales later developed it into a working prototype, with units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was featured on a digital cover of the magazine as a Lego mini-figure. She expressed shock and honor at the recognition, encouraging other young girls to pursue their ideas.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has deployed the National Guard and taken control of police in Washington D.C., a similar intervention in other major cities would be far more difficult. D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority over its National Guard and the ability to federalize its police during emergencies. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law generally prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. This legal framework means that threats to intervene in cities like New York or Los Angeles face significant constitutional barriers.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece highlights a new Department of Energy report on climate change, praising it for taking a middle-ground approach. The report, organized by a group of independent scientists, affirms that human activity contributes to warming but questions the severity of some projected impacts, such as the frequency of hurricanes and droughts. It also suggests that the economic damage from warming may be less than commonly claimed. The author argues that this nuanced perspective is a welcome, evidence-based contribution to a debate often polarized by alarmism and denial.</p>
