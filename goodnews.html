          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their first NBA title since relocating from Seattle, defeating the Indiana Pacers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, capping off his MVP season. The Thunder's victory marks the culmination of a rebuild, bringing the NBA title to Oklahoma City for the first time. The Pacers struggled after losing Tyrese Haliburton to a leg injury early in the game, and the Thunder capitalized with a dominant performance, especially in the third quarter, making them the youngest team to win a title in nearly a half-century. </p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff became suspicious that the "bride" was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for ‚Ç¨130,000 and brought in hundreds of extras to act as guests. The girl's mother claimed the event was to make her daughter feel like a Disney princess for a day. Four people, including the alleged "groom," the girl's mother, and two Latvian nationals, have been taken into custody as authorities investigate the circumstances of the incident, while a medical examination showed that the girl had not suffered any violence. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely remain in custody due to an ICE detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S., while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case. </p>

          <p>Pentagon officials revealed details of Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with others acting as decoys. The strikes targeted nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, utilizing Tomahawk cruise missiles and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites, and the U.S. warned Iran against retaliation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or people.</p>

Foreign visitors favored temples, shrines, and historic sites like Kiyomizu temple and Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine. However, Japanese visitors were more bothered by crowds, leading to disappointment for 48.4% compared to 19.4% of foreign visitors, and Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase to address overtourism issues. </p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is drawing renewed attention as Japan faces a potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With China in the midst of an escalating confrontation with the United States, experts believe Beijing may use panda loans to mend relations with Tokyo. Foreign affairs experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan, and China has long used pandas as a tool of diplomatic outreach. However, some analysts are skeptical that a new panda loan will have any tangible impact on the Japanese government's diplomatic posture toward China. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research on parent-child relationships, parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen avoid threats, bribes, or harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while setting boundaries. Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Alternative phrases that promote respect, emotional safety, and involvement can lead to better communication and cooperation, such as "I know you don't like this decision. I'll explain, and then we're moving forward" and "I see you're really upset. Tell me what's happening."</p>

NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to reach those most in need while managing GPs' workload and NHS resources. The first group eligible will be people with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and four out of five specific health conditions. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand will outstrip supply. </p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression. This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine is a medical anesthetic and, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. One patient reported that the infusions made her more receptive to psychotherapy and helped her regain a sense of normalcy, while other doctors hope to set up ketamine clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. </p>
