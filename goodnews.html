          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted for the 31st time since December, shooting lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This highly active volcano continues to draw awe, with park visitors and livestream viewers witnessing the spectacle, though no homes are currently threatened. Scientists are closely monitoring the magma dynamics, noting that while recent lava fountains may be shorter, they remain spectacular, offering a unique glimpse into geological processes. The cultural significance of the eruptions for Native Hawaiians, who view lava as a life-giving force that creates new land, underscores the profound connection between the community and this powerful natural phenomenon, enriching the understanding of the island's ongoing formation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a frustrating 2-1 defeat against the San Diego Padres, causing them to fall back into a tie for first place in the National League West. This loss came despite a stellar seven-inning outing from pitcher Blake Snell, who delivered a strong performance against his former team. The Dodgers' offense struggled significantly, managing only three hits throughout the game, with rookie Alex Freeland's solo home run being their sole score. The Padres executed a strategic offensive plan, securing their runs in the fourth inning through small ball tactics. This outcome marks a setback for the Dodgers, who had recently gained momentum but are now fighting to regain their lead.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisors Share Four Key Investing Rules Followed by Millionaire Clients</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors have outlined four crucial investing principles that their millionaire clients consistently apply to accumulate and safeguard their wealth. A primary rule involves maintaining significant liquidity, often achieved through pledged asset lines of credit on brokerage accounts, enabling access to capital for external investments without liquidating assets and incurring immediate tax liabilities. These high-net-worth individuals also emphasize "time in the market" over attempting to "time the market," committing to regular investments irrespective of short-term fluctuations, which reflects a disciplined, long-term growth strategy. Furthermore, they frequently opt for safe, low-risk investment vehicles such as bond ladders and arbitrage, designed to yield substantial returns with minimal exposure to risk, illustrating a prudent yet highly effective wealth management approach (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move designed to stimulate its domestic downstream industries. This policy aims to keep valuable raw materials within the country, thereby attracting foreign investment that incorporates local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts believe this positions Malaysia as a significant player capable of fulfilling the United States' growing demand for rare earth sources independent of China, leveraging the nation's existing processing infrastructure. The ban underscores Malaysia's commitment to exercising its "geoeconomic agency," prioritizing its own developmental needs and potentially reconfiguring global supply chains for these essential components used in various electronic hardware.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has officially overtaken the United States as the primary destination for Chinese companies pursuing initial public offerings (IPOs), signaling a notable realignment in global capital markets. This year, 46 Chinese firms successfully raised a combined $16.5 billion through listings in Hong Kong, significantly outpacing the 16 listings that garnered $740.9 million in the US during the same period. The shift is largely attributed to Hong Kong's more robust market performance, where new shares have achieved an average 19.4% increase on their trading debuts, coupled with persistent delisting concerns for Chinese stocks in the US due to regulatory ambiguities. The intensifying economic and political rivalry between China and the US is identified as a crucial factor driving this return of investment capital to Asia (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a contentious car park operator, has been compelled to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing its second court appeal against a woman it relentlessly pursued for thousands of pounds in what were deemed unfair charges. Hannah Robinson was initially penalized for exceeding a "five-minute payment rule" at a Darlington car park, a regulation that has since been prohibited by the private parking sector due to its unfairness. Despite this, Excel Parking continued its "relentless" demands. The court ultimately found the £100 penalties unenforceable and the five-minute rule "inherently preposterous," condemning Excel's conduct as unreasonable. This significant victory for Robinson, who received pro bono legal assistance, aims to encourage other drivers to challenge similar aggressive and unjust parking enforcement practices.</p>
