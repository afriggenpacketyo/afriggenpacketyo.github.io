          <p>Chinese sportswear company 361 Degrees has announced it will become the first brand from the country to pioneer the use of stablecoins for payments in its operations outside mainland China. The Xiamen-based firm plans to integrate these digital tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies like the US dollar, across its e-commerce platforms, offline stores, and supply chain services. The company stated the move is designed to improve payment efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and mitigate foreign exchange risks. This adoption reflects a growing trend of cryptocurrency integration in the global business sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks his second trip to the country since the full-scale war began, where he is scheduled to meet with veterans and government officials. As the founder of the Invictus Games, his visit highlights his commitment to the recovery of wounded military personnel, coinciding with Ukraine's bid to host the event in 2029. His Archewell foundation also recently donated $500,000 to aid injured children in both Gaza and Ukraine, funding medical evacuations and prosthetic development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The common spice horseradish offers significant health benefits beyond its ability to clear sinuses, according to health experts. The root vegetable contains compounds like sinigrin and isothiocyanates, also found in cruciferous vegetables, which may help fight inflammation and disrupt cancer cells. These compounds have also demonstrated powerful antibacterial effects against common foodborne pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. While potent, only a small amount is needed to reap its benefits, which include providing vitamin C and essential minerals like potassium.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that his relationship with former striker Alexander Isak changed after the player went on "strike" to force a transfer to Liverpool. Isak, who completed a British record £125m move on deadline day, trained separately from the team and missed the first three games of the season. Howe acknowledged that communication became difficult during that period, marking a turning point in their previously positive working relationship. He emphasized the club's desire to create an environment where players want to stay, noting that Isak seemed happy until the offer from another club altered his perspective.</p>

          <p>A number of retired NFL and UFC athletes are seeking treatment for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) with ibogaine, a psychedelic substance derived from a West African shrub. Despite being a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S., these athletes travel to clinics in Mexico, reporting life-changing results in reducing depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts associated with TBI. An observational Stanford study on military veterans showed ibogaine significantly reduced PTSD and depression symptoms, suggesting it may stimulate brain healing. While experts urge caution and call for more rigorous clinical trials, there is growing momentum for research into its therapeutic potential.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Approve Significant Pay Raise for Incarcerated Firefighters</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's incarcerated firefighters, who currently earn as little as $5.80 per day, could soon see a substantial pay increase after state lawmakers unanimously approved a new bill. The legislation would raise their pay to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour when they are assigned to an active fire. Proponents argue the measure recognizes the life-threatening work these individuals perform and will help them build savings or pay restitution. The state's inmate fire crews, who perform crucial tasks like clearing brush and digging containment lines, often constitute a significant portion of the workforce battling California's wildfires.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a dense urban environment, New York City is providing crucial habitat for monarch butterflies, a species facing significant population decline nationwide. The key to their survival in the city is the growing movement to plant native species, particularly milkweed, the only plant monarch caterpillars can eat. Community gardens, public parks, and even small "guerilla gardening" plots are creating pockets of refuge that sustain the butterflies during their miraculous multi-generational migration to Mexico. This urban conservation effort demonstrates that even small-scale actions can have a significant positive impact on wildlife, offering a model for other cities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has detailed the financial structure of the new tariff agreement with Japan, which includes a $550 billion investment from Tokyo into American projects. Under the deal, the U.S. and Japan will initially split profits equally from these projects until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. Afterward, the profit share will shift dramatically to 90% for the United States and 10% for Japan. Lutnick stated this arrangement should not cost Japanese taxpayers in the long run, while the U.S. gains significant funds to bolster domestic manufacturing in priority sectors.

          <p>Microsoft has avoided a potentially massive antitrust fine from the European Union after agreeing to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office software suites. The European Commission accepted the company's binding commitments, which will be in place for at least seven years. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer versions of its popular productivity software at a reduced price without Teams and improve interoperability with competing products. The investigation was initiated in 2023 following a complaint from rival platform Slack, which is owned by Salesforce, alleging abusive bundling practices.</p>
