          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs. The system freezes water at night when electricity is cheaper, and then uses the ice to cool buildings during the day. This can lower cooling costs by up to 40%. The system helps to reduce the strain on the power grid during peak hours. The technology offers a promising solution for energy storage and efficiency. There is a potential for stability.</p>
