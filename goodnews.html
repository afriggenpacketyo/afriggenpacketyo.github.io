          <h2>World Gold Council Researcher Dismisses Crypto as Threat to Gold's Safe-Haven Status</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 00:42:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an expert with the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins are not a viable alternative to gold and do not pose a threat to its role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of crypto as 'gold 2.0'. Reade's comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar.

          <p>Google's cloud service experienced significant global outages, disrupting numerous internet services, including Shopify and OpenAI, beginning at 10:51 a.m. PT. Google Cloud indicated that engineers were investigating the issue, but did not provide an estimated time for resolution, with customers still experiencing varying degrees of impact. The outages represent a setback for Google, which is competing with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in cloud infrastructure, and the incident affected 13 of Google's cloud services across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. While Cloudflare also reported issues, they clarified that a Google Cloud outage caused the problems for a limited number of their services, with all services now restored.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new CDC report, the average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has risen to nearly 30 years old in 2023, increasing from 28.7 in 2016. The average age for first-time mothers also increased from 26.6 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2023, with experts citing factors such as changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, dropping from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023, which may be attributed to delayed sexual activity or improved contraceptive practices among adolescents. This trend reflects broader societal shifts in family planning and reproductive health.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure for Meta, confirming reports of a $14.3 billion investment from the social networking company, which will acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup without voting power. Wang will join Meta to work on its superintelligence efforts, while Scale AI's chief strategy officer, Jason Droege, will take over as CEO. Meta's investment and Wang's hiring are part of Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster the company's AI initiatives amid competition from OpenAI and Google, though Scale AI assures its customers that Meta will not have access to their business information or data. This strategic move underscores the increasing importance of AI in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is underway in the U.S., featuring 32 teams competing for a redesigned trophy and a substantial $1 billion prize pool, with the winner set to take up to $125 million. This revamped tournament represents a significant expansion of the previous format, but has faced criticism from players concerned about an already congested schedule. Ticket sales have been sluggish, prompting FIFA to implement dynamic pricing and reduce costs, while the competition features top teams like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Inter Milan, alongside lesser-known clubs, marking FIFA's attempt to create a more global club tournament. Despite the controversies, the tournament promises high-profile matchups and an opportunity to grow the sport globally.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers rallied from a 3-0 deficit to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-4 in overtime in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final, tying the series 2-2. Leon Draisaitl scored the winning goal in overtime, marking the biggest Stanley Cup Final road comeback in 106 years and only the sixth time in NHL history that a team has overcome a three-goal deficit to win a final game. The Panthers, who initially led with power-play goals from Matthew Tkachuk and Anton Lundell, squandered their lead as the Oilers responded with goals from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Darnell Nurse, and Vasily Podkolzin. The game featured a pair of high-profile spectators, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, but the Oilers' victory underscored the evenly matched nature of the series and the resilience of both teams.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of contemporary China, has described the country as an 'engineering state,' noting its remarkable infrastructure and technological achievements. Unlike tourists in many places, visitors to China are often impressed by the beauty and innovation of subway stations in major cities, which are often sparkling clean. China has built bigger and more infrastructure projects than anyone else, including dams, bridges, and high-rises, and its STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one. Most of the nation‚Äôs top officials are engineers, whereas in the US, their counterparts are often lawyers, leading Wang to contrast China's 'engineering state' with the US's 'lawyerly state'.</p>
