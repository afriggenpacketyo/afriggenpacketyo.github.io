          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of misleading customers into Prime subscriptions and complicating cancellations. The agreement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and allocates $1.5 billion for refunds to approximately 35 million affected consumers. As part of the settlement, Amazon, which did not admit wrongdoing, is required to make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and straightforward for users. This penalty is one of the largest ever imposed by the FTC, though Amazon still faces a broader antitrust lawsuit from the agency.</p>

          <p>AI cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave has announced a new $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI, significantly expanding their existing partnership to a total of $22.4 billion. This agreement underscores the immense trust leading AI innovators place in CoreWeave's capacity to power demanding AI training and inference workloads. The deal comes as the entire AI industry faces a critical shortage of computing capacity, a constraint recently highlighted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, specializes in building and renting data centers filled with high-demand GPUs, positioning it as a key player in the AI infrastructure race.</p>

          <p>The IRS and Treasury Department have finalized new rules from the Secure 2.0 Act that will affect 401(k) catch-up contributions for high earners starting in 2027, with some plans adopting changes as early as 2026. Under the new regulations, workers aged 50 and older who earn more than $145,000 must make their catch-up contributions to a Roth account using after-tax dollars. This change eliminates the immediate tax deduction for these contributions, shifting the tax burden to their higher-earning years rather than retirement. The rule could particularly impact high earners whose plans do not offer a Roth 401(k) option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce government plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital identification scheme. The initiative is aimed at modernizing state services, cracking down on illegal employment, and improving access to government functions like medical records and banking. The government will launch a consultation to determine the practicalities of the system, including how to accommodate individuals without smartphones or passports. This move signals a significant shift in the debate around national identity systems, which a previous Labour government failed to introduce over a decade ago due to opposition.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Amazon and Walmart, along with shipping carriers, are escalating their investment in robotics to handle the anticipated surge in online holiday sales. At advanced fulfillment centers, robots perform tasks such as moving items from storage and lifting heavy packages, which increases efficiency and enhances worker safety. Amazon reports that its most advanced robotic facility is 25% more efficient and can operate nearly 24/7 during peak seasons. While automation is replacing some manual jobs, companies state it is also creating new, higher-paying technical roles, such as robotics maintenance engineers, to manage the sophisticated systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginning in October, the European Union will phase in a new Entry/Exit System that requires travelers from outside the Schengen Area, including Americans, to provide biometric data upon arrival. Visitors will have their fingerprints scanned and a photograph taken, and those who refuse will be denied entry. The automated system, which will replace traditional passport stamps, is being implemented across 29 European countries to enhance security and better track who enters and leaves the region. The data collected will be stored for three years and will help authorities identify individuals who overstay their permitted 90-day visit.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 11:52:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Department for Education (DfE) has proposed a plan to increase the fees private schools in England pay for inspections conducted by the regulator Ofsted. Currently, taxpayer funds cover a significant portion of the £6.5 million annual cost, with schools contributing only £2.2 million. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson argued that taxpayers should not subsidize private businesses and that the additional revenue would be redirected to improve state schools. The proposal, now under consultation, would gradually raise the annual fees over the next five years for the approximately 1,150 independent schools, many of which are special schools, inspected by Ofsted.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level since early 2022. For a $400,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,432 per month. This represents a monthly saving of about $240 compared to January 2025, when rates were above 7%, and nearly $445 compared to the peak rates of October 2024. The more favorable lending environment has created a significant opportunity for both new homebuyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance to lower their monthly housing costs.

          <p>Polish mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel has made history by becoming the first person to ski down Mount Everest from its summit without using supplemental oxygen. After reaching the 8,849-meter peak, Bargiel successfully navigated the descent, a feat that required him to spend 16 hours in the high-altitude "death zone" due to heavy snowfall. This achievement is part of Bargiel's larger project to ski down the world's highest mountains. Previous ski descents of Everest have been completed, but all utilized bottled oxygen, making Bargiel's accomplishment a groundbreaking milestone in mountaineering.</p>

Known for two decades as "the woman in pink" due to her attire, her identification was made possible through Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which seeks to solve cold cases involving murdered or suspiciously deceased women. Police in Turkey matched her fingerprints to a national database, and a DNA sample from a close relative confirmed the identity.

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, expanding at a 3.8% annualized rate according to the Commerce Department's final revision. This figure, revised up from the previous estimate of 3.3%, was largely driven by strong consumer spending, which increased at a 2.5% pace. The solid economic performance provides evidence of resilience despite headwinds from trade wars and a slowing job market. This stronger-than-expected GDP data may influence the Federal Reserve, potentially reducing the likelihood of additional interest rate cuts later in the year as the economy appears to be on a solid footing.

          <p>With children back in school, concerns about head lice infestations are on the rise, as they are most common among preschool and elementary-aged students. The CDC emphasizes that lice spread primarily through head-to-head contact and are not an indicator of poor hygiene. Prevention methods include avoiding the sharing of hats, brushes, and clothing. While infestations can cause significant itching, they are not a health hazard and do not transmit disease. Treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services, and experts stress that children do not need to be kept out of school once treatment has begun.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the NFL franchise in a deal that values the team at $9 billion. The buyers are reported to be Sixth Street Capital and investor Dean Metropoulos. Kraft, who originally purchased the team for $172 million in 1994, will keep the proceeds from the sale on the team's balance sheet. This sale, which must be approved by the NFL's finance committee, reflects the soaring valuations of professional sports franchises and follows several other recent minority stake sales in teams like the New York Giants and Chicago Bears.
