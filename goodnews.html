          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, and bolster over 400 British businesses. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian frigates designed for joint operations. The agreement is seen as a significant win for the UK's defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly altering the employment landscape, with recent data showing a 6.7% decline in job postings over the past year, disproportionately affecting entry-level positions. While some headlines suggest a looming job apocalypse, labor economists like MIT's David Autor argue that the immediate risk is overstated, though concerns about skill acquisition for new workers are valid. The article notes that roles requiring screen-based tasks like coding and accounting are most vulnerable, while jobs demanding empathy, creativity, or physical labor, such as healthcare and construction, are more secure. Experts advise young job seekers to focus on networking and gaining practical experience to navigate the evolving market.</p>

          <p>The Irish women's rugby team has advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2014 after defeating Spain 43-27 in a high-scoring match. Despite a spirited performance from Spain, which scored five tries, Ireland secured a bonus point by halftime and sealed the victory with seven tries of their own. Grace Moore and Anna McGann each scored twice for the Irish side, whose performance was strong enough to overcome an injury to co-captain Sam Monaghan. Ireland will next face New Zealand to determine the top team in Pool C.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, a writer with liberal political views explores her journey into the world of hunting and challenges the reflexive disdain for the practice often found on the left. She argues that hunting for food is a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to the industrial factory farming system that supplies most supermarkets. The author recounts her own emotional experience of killing a deer, emphasizing the profound connection to life and death that is often detached in modern society. The article also addresses the complex issues of firearm ownership, conservation funding, and the common ground between hunters and vegetarians.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin shares her personal story of rebuilding her life after the sudden death of her husband when she was 26 years old. Initially believing she would never remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who became her second husband and biggest supporter. Their relationship not only provided companionship but also encouraged her to pursue a new, adventurous life, including becoming a full-time author and living on a sailboat in the Florida Keys. Morin's experience illustrates how a supportive partnership can open up unforeseen possibilities and lead to profound personal and professional reinvention.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White reflects on the challenges and connections he found while portraying Bruce Springsteen in the film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the period when Springsteen was creating his seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska," while battling depression. White discusses his initial anxieties about playing the iconic musician, particularly his lack of musical experience and the intimate relationship fans have with Springsteen's work. He shares that receiving Springsteen's personal approval was crucial and that he found a thematic link between this role and his character Carmy in "The Bear," both of whom grapple with generational trauma.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details revolutionary advancements in the science of chronic pain management. The article highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience to identify objective biomarkers of pain in the brain. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of individual pain for the first time. The book discusses groundbreaking trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for millions of sufferers by demonstrating that the brain's pain circuitry is both measurable and treatable.</p>

High-risk conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, among others.

          <p>A new museum exhibit in Santa Cruz, California, highlights the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a nearby military school when they decided to craft surfboards from local redwood. Their demonstration of the traditional Hawaiian royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River captivated locals and was documented in a local newspaper. This event planted the seed for surfing culture in America, decades before it was more widely popularized by Duke Kahanamoku.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader initiative against single-use plastics, the Australian state of South Australia is banning the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers. These iconic packets, a staple in many Asian takeaway restaurants, are made of recyclable plastic but are often too small to be processed correctly by recycling machinery. The ban is intended to reduce pollution and protect marine life, building on previous legislation that outlawed plastic bags, straws, and other disposable items. Officials note that without such action, the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean is projected to triple by 2040.</p>

Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement, remained committed to his unique style of realism, with Ada as his central subject.

Last season, the Rams' defense finished strong but ranked low statistically in several categories, including rushing defense and sacks.

          <p>This opinion article explores the common feeling of guilt associated with experiencing personal happiness while the world faces numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author draws on ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, where the suffering of one member is felt by all. However, these same traditions also advocate for experiencing "sympathetic joy," or the happiness of others. The piece argues that to avoid cynicism or delusion, one must acknowledge both the world's pain and its joys. Feeling good sometimes is not a betrayal, but a form of resistance and self-care in difficult times.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has provided crucial clarification for consumers hoping to claim the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire after September 30. According to the IRS, a consumer does not need to take physical possession of the vehicle by the deadline to qualify for the up to $7,500 credit. Instead, a taxpayer can secure the credit by entering into a "written binding contract" and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before September 30. This allows buyers to order a vehicle and take delivery at a later date while still benefiting from the tax break. (not investment advice)</p>
