          <p>As the United States steps back from the global climate stage, China has an opportunity to take a leading role in the green transition. With extreme weather events causing significant damage in China, investing in clean energy is not only an environmental imperative but also an act of national resilience. China already leads the world in domestic deployment of renewables and can further push the frontier of international investment in climate-smart technologies. The article suggests that focusing on green energy can drive progress across political and economic divides, offering substantial economic opportunities.</p>

Johnson argues that the family is not breaking any rules, as Peru doesn‚Äôt require vaccines and Navy policy doesn‚Äôt mandate them.
