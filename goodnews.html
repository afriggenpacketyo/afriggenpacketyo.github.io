          <p>Joe Root delivered a masterful performance, ending the first day of the third Test against India just shy of a century with an unbeaten 99. Under challenging, hot conditions on a slow pitch at Lord's, England adopted a cautious approach, reaching a score of 251-4. The English side had to overcome early setbacks, including losing both openers in a single over, but Root's determined innings provided crucial stability. India's bowlers remained disciplined, though a dropped catch of Ollie Pope could prove costly for the tourists.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's comments on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," the BBC has detailed the deep historical connections between the two nations. The article explains that Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, which is why English is its official language and many Liberians speak with an American-influenced accent. It highlights six key facts, including that Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is named after a U.S. president and its flag closely resembles the American flag. The piece provides context on the shared heritage that shapes the West African nation's culture and politics.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested a potential meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. If the meeting occurs, it would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also indicated that the U.S. might seek China's assistance in encouraging Russia to end the war in Ukraine, acknowledging China's support for Moscow's efforts. This potential diplomatic engagement comes despite Rubio, known for his hawkish views on China, having been sanctioned twice by Beijing.</p>

          <p>An essay from The Atlantic delves into the historical "battle of the brows," focusing on Virginia Woolf's vehement disdain for the "middlebrow." In the 1930s, Woolf defined the highbrow as a person of thoroughbred intelligence pursuing ideas, and the lowbrow as one focused on life itself, seeing both as honest. However, she condemned the middlebrow as an intellectually dishonest consumer who chases fashion without genuine taste for either art or life. The article reflects on how this term, which Woolf considered a grave insult, has softened over time to describe anything perceived as harmlessly pedestrian.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates nearing all-time highs, many consumers are struggling with ballooning debt, making it difficult to pay down their principal balances. The article outlines six signs that credit card debt forgiveness, a process of negotiating a reduced settlement with creditors, could be a money-saving solution. Key indicators include paying more in interest than principal, being eligible for a significant balance reduction, and facing a lengthy repayment timeline that would cost more than a settlement. This strategy is best for those who have stopped using credit and are focused solely on repayment. (not investment advice)</p>
