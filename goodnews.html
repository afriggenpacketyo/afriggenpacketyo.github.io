          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ long-term credit rating for the United States, stating that it expects "meaningful" revenue from President Trump's tariff policies to help offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The agency noted that the Congressional Budget Office projects the new law will increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending or if political developments weaken American institutions.

Proponents highlight AI's potential as a time-saving tool for lesson planning, with one survey indicating teachers save nearly six hours per week.

As school districts update their policies, many educators are focusing on teaching students how to use AI responsibly while understanding its limitations.</p>

This policy shift aims to ensure taxpayers benefit from the federal investment intended to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose approximately 4% after the company maintained its full-year outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. The home improvement giant still anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling confidence in its business performance. The company's CFO noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. This performance suggests resilience amid what the company calls a "deferral mindset" from homeowners regarding large projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, an unregulated synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The action makes possessing or selling the substance illegal and follows a push from a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the DEA to classify it as a controlled substance nationally. The drug, which has never been approved for medical use, has been linked to a growing number of fatal overdoses, including nearly 50 in Kentucky last year, as it is often disguised as legitimate prescription medication.</p>
