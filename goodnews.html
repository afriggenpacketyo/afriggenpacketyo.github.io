          <p>HS2 Ltd, the company constructing the high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham, is investigating two firms supplying construction staff for the West Midlands section due to alleged misclassification of staff and inflated billing rates. The investigation, initiated earlier this year and first reported by the i newspaper, involves Balfour Beatty Vinci, one of HS2's contractors, which has implemented additional monitoring and controls. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government and HS2 "take all whistleblower allegations extremely seriously and have a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud, bribery, and corruption". Work continues on the London-Birmingham section, with a majority of tunneling completed, while plans for a new rail line linking Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, relying on private investment, are being developed by regional mayors.</p>

With increased demand in the United States, Fantagraphics Books is reprinting an English translation, while in Argentina, the series has reopened historical wounds and resonates amid rising anxieties under President Javier Milei's government. Mart√≠n Oesterheld, the author's grandson, highlights the social and cultural phenomenon that the series has become, extending beyond the adaptation itself.</p>

          <p>Researchers worldwide are investigating human consciousness to better understand the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to become conscious, a topic long explored in science fiction. While some experts believe AI systems could soon achieve consciousness, others, like Prof Anil Seth, argue that associating consciousness solely with intelligence and language is a human-centric view. Google suspended an engineer in 2022 who claimed AI chatbots could feel, highlighting the growing debate within the tech sector. The article explores the complexities of defining consciousness and the potential societal impacts of believing machines could possess it, including the risk of moral corrosion and altered human relationships.</p>

          <p>Data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes reveal that small dwarf galaxies played a crucial role in bringing light to the early Universe, clearing the murky hydrogen fog that filled intergalactic space. These dwarf galaxies, though small, were surprisingly bright and abundant, collectively emitting enough energy to ionize the gas and allow light to shine through. Researchers analyzed data from a galaxy cluster called Abell 2744, using its gravitational lensing effect to observe these distant galaxies. This discovery challenges previous assumptions that large galaxies and black holes were the primary sources of reionization, offering new insights into the Universe's early evolution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for negotiating tariffs with the European Union until July 9, following a "good call" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump said Von der Leyen told him "we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out", posting later on Truth Social that it was his "privilege to extend the deadline". The EU's trade chief Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to securing a fair deal. In remarks to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon hours before talks with the bloc, Trump said he planned to raise tariffs on all goods sent to the US from the EU to 50% by 1 June, citing impatience at negotiations.</p>

          <p>Sergei and Tatyana Voronkov, a Russian couple disillusioned with modern Russia, decided to move to Ukraine and later became informants for the Ukrainian army after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. They provided locations and details of Russian electronic warfare systems and military hardware, helping the Ukrainian army target Russian troops. Sergei was detained and interrogated by Russian forces, confessing to assisting Ukraine, but was surprisingly released, after which the couple plotted their escape into Europe. They eventually made it to Lithuania, though Sergei was prosecuted for using a fake passport, highlighting the risks and challenges faced by those who oppose the Russian invasion.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suspends Planned 50% Tariffs on EU Until July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 19:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the suspension of planned 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump said Von der Leyen "asked for an extension on the June 1 date, and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation." Brussels and Washington have been negotiating to avoid a trade war sparked by Trump's April announcement that he would slap tariffs on most of the US' trading partners. The bloc, which Trump has repeatedly accused of having "taken advantage" of the US, has been hit with three rounds of tariffs: a 25% tax on imports of steel and aluminum and cars, a 20% "reciprocal" tariff on all imports, which has been lifted while trade talks are ongoing. A "universal" baseline 10% tariff, however, remains in place.</p>
