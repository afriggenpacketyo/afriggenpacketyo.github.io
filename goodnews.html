        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A food website compiled a list of the 15 best gas station chains for food based on online reviews, challenging the stereotype of poor-quality roadside dining. The list features chains like Wisconsin-based Kwik Trip, praised for its in-house baked goods, and Texas-based Buc-ee's, renowned for its extensive brisket and snack offerings. Many highlighted chains are family-owned and offer unique regional specialties, from Royal Farms' fried chicken on the East Coast to Allsup's deep-fried burritos in the Southwest, showcasing a surprising culinary diversity at these travel stops.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Low Penalty Success Rate at Women's Euro 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Euro 2025 women's football tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the potential causes. Experts and players suggest a combination of factors, including increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight, which can negatively impact performance. Additionally, improved data analysis and scouting mean goalkeepers are better prepared, often knowing a taker's preferred style. The overall professionalization and physical development of female goalkeepers has also made them more capable of defending the goal, contributing to the trend of more missed and saved penalties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been lifted after a series of five powerful earthquakes struck off the coast, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4. The U.S. Geological Survey located the main quake's epicenter 89 miles east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city with 180,000 residents. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned of dangerous waves but later downgraded and then canceled the alert. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also ended. There have been no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the socialist origins of Superman in response to recent conservative criticism of the character's depiction as an immigrant. Created in the 1930s by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the earliest versions of Superman were portrayed as a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums to demand better housing for the poor. Morrison explains that the character's interpretation has evolved over the decades, reflecting the societal values of the time, from a patriotic figure during WWII to a family man in the 1950s. This history suggests that the character has always been a political and social metaphor.</p>

          <p>China could mitigate the effects of U.S. technology restrictions by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South, according to policy analysts. This strategy would involve partnering on the development of inclusive AI infrastructure, promoting technology sharing, and establishing ethical frameworks that cater to diverse regional needs. By pursuing collaborative creation and equitable access to advanced technologies, Beijing could offer an alternative to the U.S. strategy of supply chain decoupling. This approach would position China as a key partner for developing nations, moving beyond its direct rivalry with Washington.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran Mike Williams, Los Angeles Chargers receiver Quentin Johnston is confident he can step up and fill the void. After a difficult rookie season, Johnston showed significant improvement last year, and now with Williams' departure, he has an even greater opportunity to become a key target for quarterback Justin Herbert. The Chargers' receiving corps is in a state of transition, with standout Ladd McConkey leading the group and promising rookies like Tre' Harris expected to contribute. Johnston states his confidence is at an all-time high, ready to prove he has what it takes.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread dissatisfaction with the two-party system, structural barriers in U.S. elections make it difficult for third parties to succeed. Political analyst Lee Drutman explains that the single-winner electoral system often frames third-party votes as "spoilers," discouraging both voters and ambitious candidates from engaging with them. While polls show a majority of Americans desire more political options, the current system funnels political activity into the two dominant parties. Drutman advocates for proportional representation with multi-member districts as a potential solution, which would allow smaller parties to gain seats and make every vote more meaningful.</p>

          <p>Writers from The Atlantic have compiled a list of six films they argue are superior to the books they were based on, challenging the common sentiment that adaptations rarely live up to the source material. The selections include Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," praised for tightening the story and creating a perfect cinematic experience, and Anthony Minghella's "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which is noted for its heightened suspense. Other films on the list are "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," "The Devil Wears Prada," "The Social Network," and "Clear and Present Danger," each chosen for elevating their narratives through exceptional filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Following a 27-19 first Test loss to the British and Irish Lions, the Australian Wallabies are banking on "desperation" to keep the series alive, but analysts question if that will be sufficient. While the Wallabies are expected to play with heightened intensity in the next match, their performance in Brisbane revealed a team still in development and struggling against the Lions' physicality and creativity. The Lions' victory was built on early dominance, and despite a period of sloppy play that allowed Australia to score late, the gap in quality was apparent. The return of key players for Australia may not be enough to overcome the Lions' superior form.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and its regulator is failing, the government plans tougher measures for water company bosses, including potential prison sentences for non-compliance. This marks the first time a clear target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following public outrage over the state of rivers and coastlines. The plan will also include a ban on wet wipes containing plastic, as part of a broader effort to reform the industry.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows a lengthy legal battle and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order to euthanize the bear. The incident had sparked a significant debate in Italy over human-wildlife conflict, as the region's bear population has grown due to a reintroduction project. JJ4 arrived safely at the German sanctuary, where she will live in a specially constructed, secure enclosure.</p>
