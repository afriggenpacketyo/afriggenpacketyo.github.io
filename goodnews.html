          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. He reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team win would have been more gratifying. The two-time AL MVP continues a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>China's space industry is experiencing a significant boom driven by private investment, which is projected to constitute 45% of the sector's total investment by 2025. This surge is fueled by technological advancements, reduced manufacturing costs, and government support for private enterprises. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace are emerging as leaders, with successful orbital launches that rival state-led missions. This growth aligns with global trends, as the space economy is forecasted to expand to US$1.8 trillion by 2035. (not investment advice)</p>

The executive director emphasized that providing a space for community and joy is a form of resistance during uncertain times.

          <p>China is focusing its economic strategy on developing "future industries," a term for emerging sectors with high growth potential, first introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2020. The government has identified key areas for advancement, including humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and large-scale AI data centers. This initiative represents a concerted push to build a new growth model based on technological innovation and industrial modernization. The goal is to secure a leading position in the next wave of global technological competition.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are using precision fermentation to create lab-grown cheese that they claim mimics the taste and texture of traditional dairy products. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats. While the plant-based cheese market has recently seen a decline, these startups are betting they can win over consumers by overcoming common issues like off-flavors and poor texture. They aim for a commercial launch in the next few years, targeting both consumers and food manufacturers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of declining ratings, the reality TV show 'Love Island' is experiencing a revival in popularity, largely attributed to its massive engagement on social media, especially TikTok. While traditional broadcast viewership is up, the show's online following has grown even faster, with millions consuming content through short clips, recaps, and commentary on the platform. This shift indicates a change in how audiences engage with daily reality shows, preferring accessible, bite-sized updates over committing to a full hour-long episode each night. The trend allows the show to retain old fans while attracting a new, digitally-native audience.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from making "indiscriminate" arrests without reasonable suspicion. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, states that arrests cannot be based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being present at a specific location. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by individuals, including U.S. citizens, who were detained. The decision represents a legal setback for the administration's intensified immigration enforcement and deportation campaign.</p>

While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his effective outing provided the momentum the team desperately needed. Reliever Emmet Sheehan followed with 4 ⅓ innings of one-run ball to earn the win.</p>

          <p>England has won its rugby test series against Argentina 2-0 after a dramatic, last-minute try from Jack van Poortvliet sealed a 22-17 victory in the second match.

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's declining birth rate by replacing roles in companionship and elder care, some experts argue this may not be entirely negative. As more young people choose a single life, they see AI as a future solution for needs traditionally met by family. A leading demographer suggests that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete. This perspective challenges the conventional narrative about the societal impacts of both AI and demographic shifts.</p>
