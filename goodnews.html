          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla visited Canada, marking the first time since 1977 that a monarch delivered the Speech from the Throne, which is meant to underscore Canada's sovereignty amid tensions with the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to formally open Canada's 45th session of parliament, seen as a strategic move amid strained relations with the U.S. and President Trump's suggestions of annexation. The visit included ceremonial events, meetings with indigenous leaders, and a tree-planting ceremony, all designed to highlight Canada's unique identity and relationship with the Crown.

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set three mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, viewing it as a challenge to the state's outsize influence on national emissions standards. For over half a century, California has been granted waivers by the EPA to enforce stricter pollution limits, leading to more efficient vehicles and a push for electric cars. Republican lawmakers, particularly those from states reliant on the fossil fuel industry, argue that California's policies are impractical and represent a liberal agenda. California's governor has vowed to fight in court to preserve the state's autonomy in setting emissions rules.</p>
