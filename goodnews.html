          <h2>Trump's Tax Plan Could Include SALT Deduction Relief Benefiting High-Earners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 11:17:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's tax policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could significantly benefit higher-income individuals. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, which is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Trump has expressed support for reforming SALT, and lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for changes, though a complete repeal is unlikely due to budgetary constraints. This article explores the potential impact of raising the SALT deduction limit on various taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is hosting a town hall in Queens, New York, amid growing speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid.

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has indicated that midfielder Jorginho is recovering well from a lung injury and may feature again this season. Jorginho's last appearance was on April 12, and details of his injury have not been officially confirmed, though sources suggest a punctured lung. In related news, Kai Havertz is also making progress in his recovery from hamstring surgery and is expected to return before the season's end. The potential return of both players would be a significant boost for Arsenal, particularly if they advance to the Champions League final.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team selection depends heavily on the recent performances of Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, with their form under scrutiny. Crawley's struggles in New Zealand and recent County Championship appearances contrast with Pope's century this summer. Selectors emphasize loyalty to players who have performed well on the international stage, citing Crawley's past successes against India and Australia. Meanwhile, uncapped seamer Sam Cook is included in the squad due to injuries to other bowlers, and captain Ben Stokes is expected to play a full role as an all-rounder after recovering from hamstring surgery.</p>

          <p>London's FTSE 100 is on track for record-breaking gains, fueled by the UK's perceived safe haven status amid global trade tensions.

Analysts suggest that the FTSE 100 could reach 8,900 points by the end of next month, though risks remain, including geopolitical hotspots and a stronger pound.

          <p>U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing expectations despite worries about the impact of President Trump's tariffs.

The report suggests resilience in the economy despite trade tensions, though analysts caution that the full impact of tariffs may not yet be reflected in the data.
