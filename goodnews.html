          <p>All SkyWest Airlines flights were briefly grounded nationwide for 21 minutes on Friday night, a measure initiated at the airline's own request, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration. The ground stop advisory, issued at 01:49 GMT, was lifted by 02:10 GMT. SkyWest, which serves as the largest US regional airline, operates flights for major carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines. Although specific reasons for the grounding were not immediately disclosed, the incident caused a temporary but significant disruption to air travel, affecting an unknown number of passengers and connections across the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a significant ruling blocking the Trump administration's nationwide expansion of fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, citing serious due process concerns for migrants. US District Judge Jia Cobb's order indefinitely postponed a January directive that aimed to apply this policy across the country and to individuals residing in the US for up to two years, a substantial increase from its previous limitation to border areas and recent arrivals. This decision represents a major blow to the administration's mass deportation efforts, particularly impacting arrests at immigration courthouses, although the ruling is expected to face an appeal. The court emphasized that while the statute itself is not questioned, its expanded application requires due process safeguards.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie, the final British singles player in the US Open, exited the tournament after a defeat to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who advanced to the fourth round. Djokovic, aged 38, overcame a lower back injury requiring a medical timeout to secure a 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-3 victory against the 30-year-old Norrie, marking his seventh win over the Briton. The Serbian champion, who is pursuing a standalone record 25th major title, expressed a degree of satisfaction with the challenging match, suggesting it contributed to his physical conditioning. This outcome sets Djokovic on course for further competition in the tournament.</p>

Their arduous voyage aboard the 'Rose Emily,' named in memory of their unborn sister, saw them endure violent tropical storms, including an incident where Lachlan was swept overboard. This remarkable human achievement surpasses the previous record of 162 days. Furthermore, the brothers have raised over £700,000 towards a £1 million goal for clean water projects in Madagascar, adding a significant philanthropic dimension to their extraordinary feat of endurance.</p>

          <p>A significant 10-mile stretch of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has finally reopened to the public for Labor Day weekend, following years of closure due to extensive storm and fire damage. The route, adjacent to Angeles National Forest, sustained severe damage from consecutive stormy winters in 2022 and 2023, along with the 2024 Bridge fire, necessitating approximately $7.9 million in repairs for new infrastructure. The reopening is a relief for the hiking community, expected to reduce congestion on popular trails and restore access to various outdoor areas. However, the timing coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the Angeles National Forest, prompting concerns about public adherence to safety regulations.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Police Department employee accidentally shot themselves at City Hall East on Friday, sustaining a graze wound from their personal firearm, according to internal sources. LAPD spokesperson Jennifer Forkish confirmed the 'unintentional discharge of a firearm' involving a non-sworn security services division employee, emphasizing that no serious injuries occurred. The incident prompted officers to cordon off the building's lobby and entrance, which houses offices for the city attorney and city controller. Internal Affairs investigators are currently handling the matter. This event highlights the importance of firearm safety even among trained personnel in secure environments.</p>

          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a notable rally, drawing considerable attention from both retail and global investors who are actively seeking more attractive investment opportunities. The Shanghai Composite Index recently hit a 10-year high, prompting investment directors to predict a sustained uptrend. This positive momentum is fueled by domestic investors reallocating funds from low-yield fixed-income products and by Beijing's strategic push for technological innovation. International investors are also increasing their engagement, with two consecutive months of inflows. Experts point to China's 'undervalued innovation' in advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics as significant drivers, indicating substantial potential for further growth in both onshore and offshore equities.

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a ruling blocking former President Trump’s efforts to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the United States. A unanimous three-judge panel of the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision, concluding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to revoke a previous TPS extension. The court emphasized that the TPS statute, as enacted by Congress, aimed to provide a predictable and stable temporary status, insulated from political changes. While a win for immigrant advocates, the immediate impact on Venezuelans whose protections already lapsed, leading to job losses and detentions, remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she faces accusations of assaulting a security guard, has garnered significant viral attention for her animated responses and the unusual questions posed by lawyers.

Her candid remarks, eye rolls, and direct responses, including a moment where she stated her pregnancy made her 'very disabled,' amused the courtroom and social media. Lawyers' inquiries about her wigs and fingernails also became viral moments, sparking debate over potential racial or misogynistic undertones. The trial is set to conclude next week.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in some states, requiring prescriptions or not offering them at all, to comply with state guidelines that necessitate CDC approvals. While the FDA has approved Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax vaccines for seniors and for younger individuals with health conditions, varying state laws create inconsistencies in pharmacy availability. CVS, for instance, cannot vaccinate even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico. This situation also impacts vaccine choices for young children, as the FDA ended emergency authorization for Pfizer's under-5 vaccine, leaving Moderna as the sole option for those 6 months to 4 years old with specific health conditions.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is exploring ways to expedite the reinstatement process for former service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. This potential policy adjustment would primarily grant honorable discharges to those whose separation was exclusively due to vaccine refusal, not additional disciplinary issues. Veterans affected by the Biden-era mandate have voiced frustration over the slow pace of returning to service since former President Trump signed an executive order for their reinstatement. A listening session on September 3rd, likely involving Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, aims to gather feedback and address the challenges faced by these individuals, highlighting ongoing efforts to resolve the policy's impact on military personnel.</p>

Event planners suggest the ceremony will be intimate, potentially at a location with personal significance, such as Kelce's Kansas City home, rather than a conventional venue.

          <p>Traditional coffee chains, exemplified by Costa, are reportedly facing significant challenges as the 'matcha generation' drives a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier, visually appealing beverages and unique artisanal coffee experiences.

The emergence of popular, TikTok-friendly brands like Blank Street Coffee, celebrated for its vibrant matcha offerings, underscores a broader trend. Consumers are increasingly seeking affordable luxury treats and favoring smaller, innovative businesses over established giants. This dynamic, coupled with rising coffee prices and cost-of-living pressures, challenges chains that struggle to adapt to evolving tastes and market demands.</p>
