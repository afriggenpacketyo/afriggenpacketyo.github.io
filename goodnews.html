          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has introduced a competitive proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, directly challenging the plan from the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan centers on a shorter third runway, which it argues would be billions cheaper and avoid the costly, disruptive rerouting of the M25 motorway. This marks the first time competing bids will be considered for the project, with the government now tasked with evaluating both submissions. The development adds a new layer of complexity to the long-debated expansion, focusing on cost-efficiency and project delivery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a blanket 15% tariff on most Korean exports to the United States. The agreement also stipulates that South Korea will facilitate $350 billion in investments within the U.S. and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appear to be differing interpretations between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and allocation of the investment funds. The deal aims to reduce the U.S. trade deficit but has prompted discussions about the distribution of profits from the proposed investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's revenue increased by 45% year-over-year to $989 million, driven by a significant rise in funded customers, assets under management, and net interest revenue. The platform's growth was bolstered by the success of its Gold subscription service and expansion into retirement accounts. Despite the positive results, the company's stock dipped slightly after it projected higher operating costs for 2025, partly due to its acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable after walking a batter and was visited on the mound by the manager and a trainer before being removed from his pitching duties. However, the two-way phenom was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter, returning to the plate in the sixth inning. The incident was a moment of concern but ultimately appeared to be a minor issue related to the weather conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision came as new data showed the economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, largely due to a drop in imports caused by tariffs, suggesting underlying weakness. In an unusual move, two board members dissented, voting for a rate cut, which indicates broadening support for lower rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the full impact of the administration's tariffs remains unclear, justifying a cautious approach for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team captured images of dense beds of clams, mats of bacteria, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme high-pressure, pitch-dark environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the deep sea than previously thought.</p>

          <p>A growing debate within the scientific community is questioning the long-held belief that screen time is inherently damaging to children's brains. Some researchers argue that much of the evidence linking screens to negative outcomes is flawed, relying on self-reporting and failing to distinguish correlation from causation. They contend that large-scale studies have not found consistent evidence of harm. However, other experts maintain that increased screen use correlates with rising depression rates and sleep disruption, advocating for parents to delay smartphone and social media access until children are older, creating a divide in expert opinion.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become the most veteran player and a key leader in the Los Angeles Rams' secondary. After a winding career with the 49ers and Steelers, Witherspoon has found a stable role with the Rams, who re-signed him to a one-year deal this offseason. Defensive coordinator Chris Shula has referred to the 30-year-old as the "Yoda" of the position group for his calming influence and savvy presence. Witherspoon is embracing his role as a mentor to younger players, providing experience and stability to a promising defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in a surprisingly minor tsunami with limited damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this best-case scenario outcome. The main energy from the undersea rupture was directed into a vast, open stretch of the Pacific Ocean, roughly between Alaska and Hawaii. This allowed the tsunami's power to dissipate significantly over a long distance before it could reach the U.S. West Coast or other populated areas.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain its failure to comply with a previous court order to restore operations at Voice of America (VOA), the government-funded international news outlet. Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of providing "cagey answers" and suggested it was attempting to "run out the clock" on the fiscal year to waste the $260 million Congress had appropriated for VOA. The agency has been largely non-operational since March, following the appointment of a new adviser who oversaw mass job losses, calling it an effort to dismantle a bloated bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis explores the growing popularity of television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which are defined by their anxiety-inducing, high-stress narratives. These programs immerse viewers in the visceral, minute-to-minute pressures of chaotic workplaces, moving away from the escapist "comfort TV" that gained prominence during the pandemic. Experts suggest these shows resonate because they reflect the real-world anxieties of modern audiences, particularly younger viewers who have grown up with economic and professional uncertainty. The realism and catharsis of seeing sincere characters navigate recognizable stress appears to be a satisfying experience for many.</p>
