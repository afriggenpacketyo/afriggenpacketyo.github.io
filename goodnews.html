          <p>Three SpaceX employees were elected without opposition to govern Starbase, Texas, a company town encompassing SpaceX's launch facility. The city, now a Type C city in Texas, includes a 1.6 square-mile area owned by SpaceX. Bobby Peden, a SpaceX VP, will serve as mayor, with Jenna Petrzelka and Jordan Buss as commissioners. SpaceX has faced regulatory scrutiny and fines for environmental violations in the area, and environmental groups have sued over the company's launch activities, however Starbase officials claim becoming a city will help improve the community for those working to build the future of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to the super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, involves posting strategic information in a public location for big money groups to see, circumventing rules prohibiting direct communication. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and a Cuomo opponent has requested an investigation into potential coordination.</p>

          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health updated its prospectus, revealing a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter to $123.8 million. The company, which filed to go public in March, has not yet shared a price range. Hinge Health's net income for the period was $17.1 million after taxes, a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss of $26.5 million. The company's updated prospectus signals its intention to proceed with the IPO despite economic uncertainty spurred by President Trump's tariff policy, which has led other companies to delay their IPOs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, while U.S. drivers are actually paying an average of $3.165 per gallon. Trump referenced RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what drivers are paying at the pump. Experts explain that RBOB excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees, making it irrelevant to consumers. The national gas price average is down 12 cents compared with last month and 49.6 cents lower than the same period last year, according to GasBuddy data.</p>

He stressed that housing stability is just as important as retirement savings, and without a paid-off home, even a solid nest egg can quickly drain under the weight of monthly mortgage payments.
