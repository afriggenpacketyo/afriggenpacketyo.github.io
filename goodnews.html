          <p>Lando Norris secured a dramatic victory in the Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a safety car deployment during his pit stop for slick tires. Oscar Piastri initially led the race after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car, triggered by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, shuffled the order. Max Verstappen, who finished fourth, received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th, further adding to the race's chaotic nature and benefiting Lewis Hamilton. The incident proved costly for Antonelli, hindering his pit stop and impacting his final position in the race.</p>

Guinness World Records arranged the meetup, and both owners were surprised by how gentle and friendly the dogs were with each other. The event highlighted the unique characteristics of these record-holding canines.</p>
