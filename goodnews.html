          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, England, has fully immersed himself in the culture of the 1940s, a passion that began with his childhood interest in the world wars. For the past two years, he has exclusively worn clothing from the era, listens to its music, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He works at a 1940s-themed tea room, where his knowledge and authentic appearance are admired by customers and his employer. His family supports his unique passion, helping him collect memorabilia, and he hopes to one day live in a home decorated entirely with period-appropriate items and antique appliances.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on Turning 35 and the Nature of Adulthood</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a continuous process of 'becoming' rather than a destination. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a cultural touchstone, he explores how life's pace and priorities shift from the chaotic energy of one's 20s to the deeper, more complex themes of middle age. The author, an American immigrant in France, discusses grappling with identity, regret, and the importance of chosen family. He concludes that while he doesn't have all the answers, life is about building a personal narrative, brick by brick, in a world that is often chaotic and troubling.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream by successfully building and operating his own seven-meter-long submarine. Fascinated by invention since childhood, the man was inspired by a television program in 2014 to create a vessel that could travel underwater. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he purchased steel plates, an engine, and a battery, and secretly constructed the submarine. His creation has now been seen navigating a local river, drawing stares and admiration from fellow villagers for his remarkable ingenuity and determination to bring his ambitious idea to life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in rice price increases after the government released stockpiles, though the overall inflation rate remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Despite the slowdown, economists note that persistent inflationary pressures and potential yen depreciation remain concerns for consumer spending and the broader economic outlook. The data adds complexity to the central bank's future policy decisions amid growth concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have been "free-riders in the past" regarding their own defense and security, accepting long-standing U.S. accusations. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Europe understands it must do more and is now increasing its defense spending, a message he believes the Trump administration has heard. This shift comes as Germany boosts its defense ties with the UK and France, forming a triangular alliance to address the threat from Russia. Merz emphasized that his government is now committed to doing whatever it takes to strengthen its military in response to the changed geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in marches and rallies to protest the Trump administration and honor the legacy of civil rights leader John Lewis. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, held on the fifth anniversary of Lewis's death, involved over 1,500 events organized by dozens of advocacy groups. Protesters' demands included an end to crackdowns on civil and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. The events, ranging from marches to voter registration drives, aimed to continue Lewis's call for engaging in "good trouble, necessary trouble" to fight for justice.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has debuted a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, which gives it enhanced operational flexibility. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transitions to horizontal flight after its vertical launch and can operate without a runway, making it ideal for remote or rugged terrain. Developed by a state-owned aerospace group, the drone was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Its intelligent control system demonstrated autonomous capabilities, including route planning and threat avoidance, which are crucial for controlling drone swarms in complex environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects for the first time in one of its original productions, the Argentine sci-fi series 'The Eternauts'. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos announced that AI was used to create a scene of a collapsing building, completing the sequence ten times faster and at a fraction of the traditional cost. He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity and enable high-quality effects for productions with smaller budgets. The move is notable as the use of generative AI in entertainment remains a controversial topic, having been a key point of contention during the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), described as a common and benign vein condition. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by images showing the president with swollen lower legs and a bruised hand. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that medical tests confirmed CVI, which occurs when leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart, and ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump remains in excellent health, as both he and his predecessor face scrutiny over their fitness for office.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that he has secured an agreement with Coca-Cola to begin producing its signature soda with "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup. While the company has yet to officially confirm the specifics, the move is seen as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement championed by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This article notes that while many consumers prefer the taste of cane sugar-sweetened Coke, public health experts point out that both sweeteners have nearly identical metabolic effects. The change is largely symbolic, as sugar-sweetened beverages remain a major health concern regardless of the sugar's source.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the rules on liquid sizes could be the next major announcement. This follows the recent, immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. While no specific details or timeline were provided, the potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of luggage and can automatically detect threats.</p>
