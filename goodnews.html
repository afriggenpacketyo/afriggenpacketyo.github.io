          <p>U.S. intelligence leaders assert that recent strikes have significantly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities, potentially setting back the program by years. CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard cited new intelligence indicating the destruction of key facilities.  This contradicts a leaked DIA assessment that suggested a shorter setback.  The statements didn't address Iran's remaining nuclear capabilities or whether enriched uranium was moved before the strikes.  President Trump, however, claimed the strikes were so swift that Iran couldn't relocate materials and announced upcoming talks with Iran.</p>

He emphasized technology investments to improve efficiency with a smaller workforce, rather than increasing staffing levels.  Bisignano also refuted claims made by Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency, that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. He reaffirmed the agency's commitment to paying benefits, though funding from Congress remains crucial to avoid future benefit cuts.</p>
