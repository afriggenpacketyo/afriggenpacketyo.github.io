          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore exhibits detailing Donald Trump's two impeachments in the "coming weeks" after their removal sparked public concern. The National Museum for American History removed a temporary placard about the impeachments, citing that it did not meet museum standards for presentation. In a statement, the museum denied that the removal was due to pressure from any administration. The updated presentation will be part of the "Limits of Presidential Power" section, alongside exhibits on the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. Set to be JFK's largest terminal, the facility is designed for international travelers and will feature light-filled spaces, 23 wide-body capable gates, and over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining. The project is part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic. The new terminal is also designed with its own microgrid for power resiliency.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering a compensation scheme for drivers who were mis-sold car loans, which could cost between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that found that particularly large hidden commissions could be considered unfair. If the scheme proceeds, most eligible individuals could receive less than £950 in compensation, with payouts potentially starting next year. The FCA stated the court's judgment provides clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship between lenders and consumers in these cases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off, suggesting a successful drill. This development is crucial for the Fujian, as it is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft. The carrier is expected to officially enter service with the People's Liberation Army Navy later this year.</p>

Raleigh, North Carolina, ranked first, followed by Nashville, Tennessee, and Austin, Texas, based on factors like unemployment rates, income growth, and labor force size. The study suggests the "geography of opportunity is shifting," as these cities offer a strong combination of a robust job market and a more affordable cost of living, highlighting their growing appeal for professionals.

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment in the UK. While the exact number is unclear, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, to receive free medical care. This official government scheme follows criticism that the UK had not yet established a formal medical evacuation program during the conflict. The initiative is being welcomed by aid organizations that have already been privately funding evacuations.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks, though no immediate damage was reported from the relatively weak tremor. Officials noted that the quake was felt up to 65 miles from its epicenter and warned residents about the possibility of aftershocks. While New Jersey is not a seismic hotspot, it lies on the Ramapo Fault line, which produces several small, usually unnoticed, quakes annually.</p>

          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to achieve early retirement by adopting principles of extreme saving and mindful spending. The philosophy encourages individuals to view money as "life energy" and to minimize expenses to maximize freedom. Adherents aim to save and invest 25 times their annual expenses, allowing them to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. The goal is to shift focus from accumulating material possessions to gaining control over one's time and pursuing personal passions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, despite being one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently stated he does not know or worry about his exact net worth. Financial planners praise this approach, suggesting that focusing on cash flow and value-aligned goals is more beneficial than obsessing over a single number. Experts advise that understanding daily income and expenses allows for more actionable financial planning. They argue that fixating on net worth can lead to a constant feeling of not having enough, whereas focusing on tangible goals promotes greater financial well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has been slow to release documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, ongoing legal cases could compel their disclosure. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed. These legal battles represent a key avenue for transparency, potentially revealing more about Epstein's sex trafficking network.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully developed a new material, CHSN01, a high-strength cryogenic steel designed for use in nuclear fusion reactors. The material solves a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, as it can withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium and the immense magnetic forces inside the reactor. This breakthrough, the result of a decade of research, addresses a key materials science problem. The deployment of this "super steel" in the world's first fusion power generation reactor places China in a leading position in the field.</p>
