          <h2>Tips to Reduce Energy Costs During Summer Heat Waves</h2>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, Americans are bracing for high electricity bills, projected to reach a 12-year high of $784. Lower-income households will be disproportionately affected, with many already struggling to pay their energy bills. Experts recommend using fans, setting AC temperatures between 70¬∞F and 78¬∞F when home and 78¬∞F when away, and regularly changing AC filters. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, limiting oven use, and unplugging unused appliances, while utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help reduce energy costs.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece defends Elon Musk as a visionary who, despite recent setbacks and criticisms, remains focused on his long-term goals, particularly space exploration. Musk's ambition to colonize Mars is driven by his belief that humanity must become a multi-planet civilization to survive the eventual destruction of Earth by the sun. The article argues that Musk's space program continues to be successful, launching significantly more tonnage into space than the rest of the world combined. It suggests that his political interventions may ultimately benefit his space ventures, highlighting his ability to profit from his ideological pursuits.</p>

          <p>Credit card issuers can lower credit limits at any time for various reasons, including inactivity, a drop in credit score, high balances, missed payments, or a change in financial situation. Issuers are legally required to notify customers after the fact, but not beforehand. A reduced credit limit can negatively impact credit utilization and potentially lower credit scores. Steps to take if a credit limit is reduced include requesting an explanation, asking for a credit limit increase, reviewing credit utilization, monitoring credit reports, and considering switching to another card.</p>
