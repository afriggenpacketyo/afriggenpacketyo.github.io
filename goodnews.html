          <p>A lawmaker has stated that a no-confidence motion against the Ishiba Cabinet will not be pursued. This announcement provides a degree of political stability for the current administration in Japan. The decision averts potential disruption and uncertainty that a no-confidence vote could have triggered, allowing the government to focus on its existing policy agenda and address pressing national issues. This development suggests a level of consensus or lack of sufficient support within the parliament to challenge the current leadership. The political landscape remains stable for the time being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even at private institutions, is raising concerns about a potential exodus from public schools. Educators and policy experts warn that this move, intended to ease household financial burdens, could exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support for struggling public schools, which face declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. While public schools have adapted to social changes, they grapple with challenges like teacher workloads and individualized responses to issues such as bullying. The policy's impact is already being observed in areas with existing free high school programs.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive, Eiji Hashimoto, expressed confidence that the U.S. government's role in its $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp. "will not hamper" the U.S. unit's business. Hashimoto highlighted the $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government as rational measures. Under the national security agreement, the U.S. president can approve key management decisions, including facility closures. Nippon Steel aims to maintain and expand production capacity at U.S. Steel, benefiting from U.S. demand for high-grade steel used in electric vehicles. The acquisition makes Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker.</p>

          <p>Despite China's repeated condemnations of recent attacks on Iran, Israel's ambassador to Beijing, Eli Belotserkovsky, stated that Israel wants to "continue talking" to China. Belotserkovsky emphasized the importance of Israel's relations with China and noted the existence of open communication channels. He did not rule out the possibility of China acting as a mediator in the conflict. This stance reflects Israel's desire to maintain diplomatic ties with China despite differing views on regional issues.

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously believed. Computer simulations indicate that these stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. The gravitational tug could destabilize objects like Pluto and increase the risk of collision or ejection for planets like Mars and Earth. While the odds are low, researchers note that the risk of collision with Earth is higher than previous estimates. The study highlights the vulnerability of our solar system to external gravitational forces.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in central London. The fragments, found in 2021, reveal detailed paintings of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit from a luxurious Roman villa. The art provides insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The team hopes to find a missing piece bearing the artist's name, scored with the Latin word "Fecit." This discovery is one of the largest assemblages of Roman wall plaster and paintings found in Roman London.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals made with China.

The Cook Islands responded that it values New Zealand's assistance and is committed to addressing the issue. The move comes as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visits China.

This comes as the US agreed to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China.
