          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced Canada's ambitious goal to double its non-U.S. exports within the next decade, citing American tariffs and growing trade uncertainty as key motivators. He stressed that Canada can no longer solely rely on the U.S. as its primary foreign partner, necessitating a strategic shift towards global giants like India and China. This economic reorientation aims to safeguard Canadian jobs in sectors vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, such as autos and steel, and to foster national economic stability amidst a fundamentally changed global trade landscape. Carney acknowledged the challenges ahead, noting the transformation will require sacrifices and time, with the government's budget on November 4 expected to detail these crucial measures.

          <p>China's ambitious Chang'e-7 mission is set to become humanity's first dedicated probe for water ice near the moon's south pole, a crucial resource for future crewed space exploration. This complex spacecraft will include an orbiter, lander, rover, hopper, and a relay satellite, making it the most intricate ever built for China's lunar program. The mission aims to land at a location with over 100 days of continuous sunlight, ideal for long-term operations and scientific study. The discovery and utilization of lunar water could provide essential resources like drinking water, breathable oxygen, and even rocket fuel for future missions, significantly advancing humanity's capabilities in space.</p>

          <p>A participant shares their experience at a 24-hour "vibe coding" hackathon in Singapore, highlighting the event's focus on building innovative AI-powered applications with support from major AI companies. The article describes diverse projects, from a productivity app that "bullies you into greatness" to an AI-powered whiteboarding tool that won the top prize, showcasing the creativity and rapid development possible. The hackathon demonstrated how AI is significantly lowering the barrier to entry for tech product development, enabling individuals with non-technical backgrounds to build functional prototypes quickly. This shift suggests that strong product sense and taste are becoming increasingly valuable, potentially leading to smaller startup and corporate developer teams and requiring continuous upskilling for engineers.</p>

Despite a strong second-half effort from RSL, including a disallowed goal, the Timbers held on, with goalkeeper James Pantemis making six saves to preserve the victory.</p>

          <p>As China's fourth plenum concludes, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece has lauded the nation's socialist system as a fundamental source of strength, driving the vast Chinese economy and providing global stability. The article emphasizes that the scientific and consistent formulation and implementation of five-year plans represent a core political strength, enabling the party to navigate challenges and maintain steady economic progress. It contrasts China's unified national strategy, which mobilizes all sides and advances steadily, with the short-term policymaking and frequent reversals often seen in multiparty systems. This messaging reinforces the party's narrative of effective governance and stability in a complex global environment as the country prepares to unveil its next five-year plan.</p>

          <p>India and South Korea have conducted their first joint bilateral naval exercise in Busan, involving the Indian naval vessel Sahyadri, a guided missile stealth frigate. This exercise, described as the culmination of years of planning, reflects growing defense ties between the two nations. It comes amid concerns over a potential security vacuum in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly if the United States reduces its military presence. The article suggests these closer defense ties are viewed as a counterweight to broader regional dynamics, with India's operational deployment extending to the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific, signaling enhanced cooperation in maritime security and regional stability efforts.</p>

          <p>The Westminster Mall in Orange County is preparing to close its doors, with most shops shutting down by October 29, to make way for a major redevelopment project. The city council approved a plan to transform the 100-acre property into a mixed-use site, featuring 3,000 housing units and 600,000 square feet of upscale retail space, along with over 9 acres for parks and recreation. Community members gathered to bid farewell to the nostalgic hub, which was once Orange County's second-highest-grossing retail center in its heyday. While anchor stores like JCPenney are closing, Best Buy and Target are expected to remain during the multi-year redevelopment, aiming to revitalize the area into a thriving activity center.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea, held its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to concerns over household debt despite stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook. This decision follows the introduction of tighter property rules in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing and cooling the housing market, which remains a critical constraint. The central bank also noted increased uncertainties from ongoing trade talks with the U.S., which are expected to gradually expand the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports, affecting the nation's economic growth. Analysts anticipate a potential rate cut in November if trade progress is made and housing policy stabilizes further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former official policy adviser has urged China to avoid falling into Western "discourse traps" when discussing issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. Speaking at Fudan University, the adviser emphasized that while China has achieved remarkable development, its interpretation of these successes often contrasts sharply with Western media and public opinion. He advocated for confidence in defending the Communist Party's rule but warned against an approach that risks alienating Global South countries by merely fighting back. This article highlights China's strategic efforts to shape its international narrative and challenge perceived "double standards" regarding its rise, particularly in diplomatic and media engagements, to gain broader global understanding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early voter turnout is exceeding expectations in California’s special election for Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, comparable to presidential election levels, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and non-party preference voters. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed Proposition 50, emphasize the measure's importance for democratic fairness against partisan gerrymandering. This high engagement is notable for a redistricting topic, suggesting strong interest in preventing efforts to entrench political power. The outcome, requiring a simple majority, will significantly impact the state's congressional representation and potentially the national balance of power.</p>
