          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers are set to open across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These walk-in clinics, staffed by specialists, will offer immediate care to individuals experiencing acute mental distress, with referrals also accepted from GPs and police. While NHS England hails the initiative as a pioneering model to provide the right support in the right setting, some experts express skepticism, calling for careful testing and improved funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted that A&E wait times are at their highest levels since modern records began.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on mutual respect, following threats from former US President Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU.

          <p>Many young people in China are putting retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and pressures related to housing and marriage. They are too preoccupied with present circumstances to think about old age, viewing retirement as too distant to prioritize in a rapidly changing world. While the Chinese government urges young people to plan early for retirement, many are focused on living well in the present. This trend is exacerbated by the country's rapidly aging population and a strained state pension system.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are embracing "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these 20-somethings are content with doing the bare minimum, clocking in and out on time, and not seeking promotions or praise. This shift is driven by a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation. Experts suggest that the pandemic and changing corporate practices have contributed to this new attitude towards work.</p>

Koizumi also intends to explore online sales to ensure broader distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. to discuss potential collaboration.

          <p>The CEO of Sakana AI K.K., a Japanese artificial intelligence startup backed by Nvidia Corp., is urging the Japanese government to prioritize the development of its own AI technology for defense applications. David Ha believes that Japan's increasingly severe security environment presents an opportunity for his company to engage with the government in developing defense-related solutions. He emphasized the importance of AI in bolstering information technology infrastructure and cyber security, particularly in a deglobalized world where AI could become a bargaining chip.</p>

          <p>"Jane Austen Wrecked My Life" is a warm romance about a lonely clerk working at Shakespeare and Company who gets lost in love notes and believes she was born in the wrong century. She gets accepted into a Jane Austen Residency where she meets a handsome Englishman. The film is about literature, writing, poetry, and the characters talking about what literature means to them. The movie will be pleasantly predictable in its outcome but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not an enjoyable journey.</p>

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at its stores, priced significantly lower than domestically-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The move aims to address consumer concerns about rising prices and potential shortages, while maintaining overall rice consumption.</p>
