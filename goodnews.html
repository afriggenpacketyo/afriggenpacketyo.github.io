          <p>UK authorities have successfully intercepted a major drug shipment, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The narcotics, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million, were discovered hidden within a vessel arriving from Panama. This operation represents the sixth-largest cocaine seizure in the UK's history, according to the Home Office. The bust highlights the ongoing efforts by the UK Border Force to disrupt international criminal networks using container ships to supply Europe's large cocaine market.</p>

          <p>A real estate broker with a decade of experience recommends using the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a house is the right fit for a buyer. This guideline suggests that the ideal property should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location or size. Another 10% should consist of things you can improve over time, such as paint or countertops. The final 10% are imperfections you can live with, ensuring that minor flaws don't overshadow a home that is overwhelmingly suitable for your needs and lifestyle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting that Americans will see the cheapest summer gas prices in years, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 a gallon by September. The recent spike in oil prices due to the Israel-Iran conflict is expected to be temporary, allowing prices to resume a gradual decline. Factors contributing to the expected drop include increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near a 20-year low, with Americans spending a smaller portion of their income on fuel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus has stated it has "no plans" to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following reports that it was considering moving production to the United States. The company, which employs 1,300 people at its UK headquarters, acknowledged it is "actively exploring" global market options but remains committed to its British heritage. The speculation arose after production was temporarily halted due to new U.S. tariffs on imported cars, a significant market for the iconic brand.
