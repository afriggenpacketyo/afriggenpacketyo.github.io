The star won the contest for Switzerland in 1988, and it had been rumoured she would take the stage as the ceremony returns to the country this year. The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite. Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley remains focused on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) despite economic upheaval and political uncertainty, including potential tariffs. Founders and executives believe that AI will continue to advance regardless of external factors, potentially disrupting traditional markers of economic development. While some express concern about immigration and international collaboration, the dominant sentiment is that AI will drive innovation and transform industries, even in the face of a potential recession. The industry's focus is on reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI), seeing it as a force that can overcome economic and political challenges.</p>
