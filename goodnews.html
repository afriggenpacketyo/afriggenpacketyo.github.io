        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond outlined the university's strategy in response to the House settlement, which allows direct payments to athletes beginning July 1. UCLA plans to allocate $20.5 million in revenue sharing, the maximum permitted under the settlement, while maintaining its Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The revenue will be distributed following a formula similar to the back-payment model, with a larger share going to football and men‚Äôs basketball players, with payments increasing annually over the 10-year agreement. This move aims to level the playing field with other Big Ten schools and enhance UCLA's competitiveness in attracting top athletes while ensuring resources for Olympic sports.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill expressed pride in his players' character despite a 2-1 friendly defeat to Denmark. Shea Charles scored an early goal for Northern Ireland, but Denmark rallied with goals from Gustav Isaksen and Christian Eriksen. O'Neill was pleased with how his young squad absorbed pressure and remained competitive throughout the match, even after a goal from substitute Mika Biereth was ruled out for offside. The manager highlighted the team's resilience in staying in the game until the final whistle.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has successfully taken her first flight from the nest. The event occurred around 8:27 a.m. local time, following her sister Sunny's first flight earlier in the week. Gizmo's initial attempt was brief, but she soon soared into the air and landed on a nearby tree. While it is uncertain where Sunny and Gizmo will venture, young eagles typically return to the nest shortly after their first flight, with the eaglets expected to leave the habitat permanently by fall.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep in both T20 and ODI series against the West Indies. This victory marks a positive start for Edwards and new captain Nat Sciver-Brunt after a disappointing Ashes series. However, previous successes in home bilateral series have not translated to success on the big stage, and tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Questions remain about whether the "new" England team can perform under pressure when it matters most.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role leading the party's "Doge team," modeled after President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer a good use of his time. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return, stating he will now take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. Yusuf explained that his resignation was a decision born of exhaustion after 11 months of hard work.</p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's recent departure from the Trump administration, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to exert influence, with members embedded in various agencies. The team's approach to transforming government is becoming "institutionalized," as described by one official. This suggests that the cost-cutting measures and efficiency initiatives implemented under Musk's leadership will persist, even without his direct involvement. The long-term impact of DOGE on government operations remains to be seen, but its initial efforts have already left a mark.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing cuts made by the council. The council approved a budget that reduced the number of police officers hired in the coming fiscal year from 480 to 240. As part of the agreement, the council leadership will identify funds for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days, with the money allocated within the 90-day deadline. The restoration of the police recruits would require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year.</p>

          <p>More than 100 dogs were rescued from an apparent puppy mill in North Carolina, where they were found in "egregious conditions." The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs from a home where they were surrounded by their own waste, packed into cages, or roaming in cramped, filthy quarters. Many of the dogs were mother dogs with nursing puppies, and the shelter is providing medical care and rehabilitation to the rescued animals. The homeowner surrendered 21 chickens in addition to the dogs, and it remains unclear whether charges will be filed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing parliamentary deadlock, French politicians have turned to remembrance politics, initiating three new measures to recognize and address historical injustices. These initiatives include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing and compensating returnees from French Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt" from 1825. While these symbolic gestures have been met with mixed interpretations, some see them as a form of social maturity, while others view them as easier to pass than structural reforms. The shift towards remembrance politics reflects the challenges in addressing pressing issues such as pensions, education, and the budget.</p>
