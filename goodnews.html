The airline will prohibit the use of portable charging devices while stored in a bag or overhead bin, and the rule will take effect on May 28. This move is intended to allow crew members to respond more quickly to potential fires caused by lithium-ion batteries. The FAA prohibits spare lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but Southwest's policy goes further by requiring passengers to keep these items visible to the crew during flight if they are in use. </p>
