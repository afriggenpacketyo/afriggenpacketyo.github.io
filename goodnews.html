          <p>Vice President JD Vance traveled to Montana to meet with Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, and other Fox News executives at the Murdoch family ranch. The purpose of the meeting is unclear, and a Fox News Channel spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. The vice president's office did not release a schedule for Vance, and the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, led to local speculation. Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Trump the following day, suggesting he returned to Washington shortly after the meeting.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, the co-founder of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy as one of music's true visionaries. As a composer, arranger, and constructor of textures, Wilson's control of emotion allowed him to articulate feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment. The Beach Boys' hits are deeply embedded in American culture, with Wilson's studio experimentation leading to advances that rivaled the Beatles. Despite battling mental illness, Wilson continued to create music, leaving a lasting impact on the music world and epitomizing the lore of Southern California.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil based on claims that he is a threat to U.S. foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, and his speech was being chilled. Khalil has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March, missing the birth of his first child. Despite the ruling, Khalil can still remain in custody based on claims that he inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>

Newsom's clear messaging and unexpected online offensive have significantly increased his reach, with millions watching his address and searches about him surging.
