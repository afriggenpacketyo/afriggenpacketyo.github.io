          <p>British officials are continuing trade negotiations with the United States, even after a court ruling overturned many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The UK team is aiming for deals covering sectors like cars, metals, and aeroplane parts within weeks. Despite a pause in the ruling by an appeals court, the UK believes the original decision will be overturned by the Supreme Court. Discussions include tariff implementation, treatment of UK-assembled cars, and pharmaceutical products. The UK is also negotiating a controversial trade deal with Gulf countries, which lacks provisions on human rights and environmental issues.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but their travel habits are changing. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market, especially travelers in their 30s and 40s, by opening an account on a Chinese social media platform. Visitor numbers from Hong Kong experienced a decline in February and March, believed to be influenced by a manga predicting a major disaster in Japan this July, though April saw a strong rebound.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, announced that Japan and the U.S. have agreed that tariff talks are progressing towards a potential deal as early as next month.

While Japan insists on the removal of all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, the U.S. emphasizes boosting investment and addressing economic security issues. The leaders of both countries are expected to discuss the matter on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Tokyo to Houston. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and intervened when he saw him grab the emergency exit door. With the help of a fellow passenger and flight attendants, Armentrout secured the man with zip ties for the remainder of the flight. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the FBI and local police took custody of the man, and a second unruly passenger was removed after punching a bathroom door.</p>

The incident highlights the crucial role honeybees play in pollination and food production, as they pollinate over 100 crops.

The court ruled that the Executive Order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston, who questioned whether the administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE.</p>
