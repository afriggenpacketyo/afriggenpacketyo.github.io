          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' the first book written in the Kannada language to receive the award. Translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, the book poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India through twelve short stories written between 1990 and 2023. Mushtaq's work reflects the challenges faced by women due to religious conservatism and patriarchal societies, drawing from her own experiences and observations. The win highlights the value of attention to lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, making Delaware the 11th state to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. The law allows mentally capable adults with six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options, undergo two waiting periods, and obtain a second medical opinion before obtaining a prescription for lethal medication. The law is intended to provide compassion, dignity, and control to those facing their final moments.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to ‚Äúpause‚Äù its scheme to pay out big bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan, following accusations of trying to circumvent rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable, as Thames Water faces heavy criticism over its performance and financial stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Farm Minister, Taku Eto, resigned following criticism over his remark about not needing to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts from supporters, a comment deemed insensitive given soaring rice prices affecting the public. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation, appointing Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The controversy arose ahead of a crucial national election, adding pressure to Ishiba's government already struggling with public dissatisfaction over rising rice prices. The government has been releasing rice from emergency stockpiles, but prices remain high, leading some supermarkets to sell cheaper imported rice.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks after Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched seven shutout innings. Despite Yamamoto's strong performance, the Dodgers nearly lost the game after Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth and the Diamondbacks took the lead in the tenth. However, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the tenth, with Tommy Edman hitting an RBI double, Will Smith getting hit by a pitch with the bases loaded, and Max Muncy walking it off with a sacrifice fly. The win sets up a series rubber match with the Diamondbacks.</p>

          <p>Japanese mathematician Masaki Kashiwara, the first Japanese recipient of the Abel Prize, expressed his love for "beautiful" math, which sustained him through his research career. He felt the beauty of math "the moment I proved something new" and questioned Japan's approach to math education, contrasting it with Norway's high value for math education. Kashiwara also noted the drastic changes in research methods due to the internet and his collaboration with mathematicians in South Korea. He expressed concern that Japan's university entrance examination system could reduce students' motivation to pursue careers in math.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease will be available in the US from late June, following regulatory clearance for its use last week. The test, developed by Fujirebio Holdings, is designed to detect amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs. It will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The process takes roughly 30 minutes from drawing the blood to diagnosis and will be available at a fraction of the cost of a PET scan, making new Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments more accessible.</p>

Mr. Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, although the Congressional Budget Office said it would likely cost far more, as much as $542 billion. The president said that the Golden Dome would be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space.</p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as workers seek a less competitive lifestyle compared to major coastal cities. Despite being derided for its slow pace, Chengdu has become one of the fastest-growing cities in China, with its population increasing by 30 percent in the last five years. Young people are increasingly disillusioned with the hypercompetitive work culture in megacities and are drawn to Chengdu's more relaxed atmosphere, thriving entertainment sector, and lower cost of living, leading to a significant rise in housing prices.</p>
