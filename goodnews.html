          <p>Members of the U.S. Air Force team that conducted stealth bomber strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have shared details about the high-stakes mission. The operation, codenamed "Midnight Hammer," involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying a 36-hour mission from Missouri to hit three underground targets with 30,000-pound bombs. Commanders described the mission's execution as "perfect," highlighting the B-2's unique combination of long-range capability, heavy payload, and stealth technology, which was supported by F-22 and F-35 fighter escorts. The account follows a presidential announcement of an order for 28 new B-2 bombers.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new content restrictions for Instagram users under the age of 18, aligning the platform's standards with those of a PG-13 movie rating. The new default setting will block teens from seeing search results for sensitive topics like "gore" or "alcohol" and prevent them from following or interacting with accounts that frequently post age-inappropriate material. The update also extends these regulations to Instagram's integrated AI, ensuring its responses are age-appropriate, and introduces an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for parents.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 rebel group have agreed to create an international mechanism to oversee a ceasefire in the country's conflict-ridden eastern provinces. The deal, mediated by Qatar, aims to enforce a cessation of hostilities that was agreed upon in July but has largely failed to stop the fighting. The new monitoring body will include representatives from both sides, as well as observers from Qatar, the United States, and the African Union. It is seen as a crucial step toward a potential comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

The research, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, found that while all mothers in the study saw improvement, those in the singing group sustained that improvement for six months after the sessions ended. The program, "Melodies for Mums," helps create social bonds and has a relaxing physiological effect, offering a promising, accessible alternative or supplement to traditional therapies amid long waits for mental health services.</p>

          <h2>AI Image Generators Highlight Real-World Bias by Failing to Represent Disabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 19:14:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The limitations and biases of AI are being highlighted by its inability to accurately generate images of people with disabilities. Former Australian Paralympic swimmer Jess Smith shared her experience of ChatGPT failing to create a headshot of her with one arm, instead producing images of a woman with two arms or a prosthetic. While OpenAI has since made improvements, others, like a user with sight in one eye, report similar issues where the AI "corrects" their appearance. Experts say these failures reflect a lack of diverse data in AI training and emphasize the need for more inclusive development.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control its entire business stack, from chip design to consumer hardware, in a strategic pivot that mirrors Apple's ecosystem approach. A new partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators is the latest move, designed to optimize infrastructure specifically for its own models and reduce reliance on third parties like Nvidia. This, combined with the acquisition of Jony Ive's design firm for AI-native devices and massive infrastructure investments, shows OpenAI is betting that owning the hardware, developer platform, and models will secure its long-term dominance.

          <p>Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, who grew up a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now publicly rooting against the team during their MLB playoff run. Haliburton has been seen wearing the jerseys of the Brewers' opponents, including the Cubs and Dodgers, during his own preseason games. He explained that his allegiance shifted after the Brewers allegedly canceled his scheduled ceremonial first pitch last summer, an action he believes was retaliation for his Pacers team eliminating the Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. His "free agency" as a baseball fan has become a notable sports storyline.</p>
