          <p>Renowned artist Amy Sherald, known for her portraits of Black Americans, shared insights into her career and her decision to cancel a Smithsonian exhibition. She withdrew her "American Sublime" retrospective due to concerns that museum officials, under pressure from the Trump administration, might censor her painting of a transgender person as the Statue of Liberty. Sherald, whose portrait of Michelle Obama brought her widespread recognition, views her work as patriotic, redefining American identity to include everyone. The article also touches on her personal journey, including a life-saving heart transplant, and her distinctive grayscale technique for skin tones, which aims to encourage viewers to see the humanity in her subjects.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan for 2026-2030 will guide the world's second-largest economy, building on a history of plans that have profoundly reshaped the global landscape. The article highlights three pivotal plans: the 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up" that led to China's economic rise and the "China shock" of outsourced manufacturing jobs. The 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, making China a leader in EVs and renewables. More recently, the 2021-2025 plan emphasizes "high quality development" to challenge American tech dominance. These plans demonstrate China's long-term strategic vision, impacting global trade, technology, and geopolitical power.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Introduces New V-Levels to Simplify Post-GCSE Vocational Education</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 18:18:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational "V-levels" for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-16 qualifications. These V-levels are set to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with ministers also proposing an alternative qualification to reduce GCSE maths and English resits. The initiative aligns with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's focus on vocational training and a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns of potential gaps, the government expects V-levels to build on practical skills and lead to employment, allowing students to mix and match with A-levels or pursue apprenticeships.</p>
