          <h2>Maine Fishermen Support Jordon Hudson's Advocacy for the Industry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Maine Coast Fisherman‚Äôs Association has voiced their support for Jordon Hudson after her advocacy for Maine fishermen during the Miss Maine USA pageant. Hudson, whose family's fishing business went bankrupt due to state regulations, highlighted the struggles of fishermen in rural Maine and advocated for government support to prevent further economic hardship for these communities. The association praised Hudson for bringing attention to the challenges faced by Maine's fishing communities in a unique way, emphasizing that advocacy takes many forms and her voice matters. Hudson's parents owned a fishing business, Frenchman‚Äôs Bay Fisheries, in Maine, but after the area they used to fish was closed off to fishing by the state in 2000, their business eventually went bankrupt years later.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with outfielder Juan Soto regarding his effort level when running to first base after Soto failed to run hard on multiple plays. Soto's lack of hustle was apparent in a game against the Red Sox, where he watched a hit bounce off the Green Monster, resulting in only a single, and in a previous game against the Yankees. While Soto denies any lack of effort, Mendoza emphasizes the importance of running hard in all situations, particularly in Fenway Park due to the dimensions of the field. Soto recently signed a 15-year, $765 million contract with the Mets.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Allianz Trade reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., despite a temporary tariff reduction following a deal between Beijing and Washington. The survey indicates that the trade war has left lasting scars on Chinese exporters, leading them to diversify away from the U.S. market. Even with the temporary tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than before the second Trump administration. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is emerging as a preferred destination for Chinese firms seeking to move production overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump are engaged in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration as "corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous" during a concert in England. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggesting that Springsteen and Beyonc√© should be investigated for illegal campaign donations to Kamala Harris. Springsteen has been a long-time political opponent of Trump, and has spoken out against Republican presidents in the past. The article highlights the political risk of Trump attacking musical figures like Beyonc√© and Taylor Swift due to their younger, more female audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the company does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. He noted that over half of the company's sales come from the U.S., and they have diversified their import sources, reducing reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which indicated it would need to raise prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's full-year sales forecast remains unchanged, with expectations of 2.8% total sales growth and 1% comparable sales growth, based on the continuation of temporary tariff agreements.</p>

Additionally, the deal only recognizes the "value" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts to support travel and cultural exchange, while a full agreement on the recognition of professional qualifications could take much longer to negotiate.</p>

          <p>A Chinese scientific study has traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. The research suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. These findings support the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging earlier findings about the lineage of this common ancestor. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could uncover insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to protect jaguars by changing perceptions of them from cattle-killing villains to valuable parts of the ecosystem. The project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect the animals and their prey. This approach has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, who are learning to coexist with the predators. The initiative has led to a stable population of jaguars in the reserve and surrounding ranching region.</p>
