          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:58:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to prevent a major rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the government is now in a "better position" after strengthening the plans in response to concerns about potential harm to disabled individuals. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. This U-turn has seemingly appeased most rebels, securing the bill's likely passage.</p>

          <p>In a period of market uncertainty, top-rated Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks for potentially enhanced returns. Among the highlighted companies are McDonald's, favored for its value proposition and potential for sales growth, and EPR Properties, a REIT benefiting from improved capital costs and a recovering experiential property market. Oilfield services company Halliburton is also noted for its strong international market position and opportunities for margin enhancement, which could support its dividend payouts.

          <p>In an introspective essay, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) grapples with the challenge of resisting despair in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She advocates for holding onto opposing thoughts simultaneously: acknowledging horror while committing to action, and feeling rage while channeling it into purpose. The author points to the community-building power of protests and draws inspiration from activists like those at the City of Joy in Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, who organized grassroots aid. The essay concludes that in the face of failing systems, every act of care, love, and community building is a form of resistance and a step toward creating a new world.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental rise, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million today. The company has grown from a niche sportscar maker with minimal revenue into one of the world's most valuable corporations, driven by the mass-market success of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. However, the stock has faced recent headwinds in 2025 due to sluggish sales, increased competition, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Musk now tells investors that the company's future value lies not in cars, but in solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

Players like Newcastle's Tino Livramento and Liverpool's Harvey Elliott, who was named player of the tournament, are seen as strong contenders. The success highlights the strength of England's youth development pipeline, which has produced multiple European and World Cup wins at youth levels in recent years.

          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event holds crucial lessons for California's preparedness for the next "Big One." The 1925 quake, estimated at magnitude 6.5 to 6.8, exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address with mandatory retrofits. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style during its rebuild. Experts note that while progress has been made, many cities still lack ordinances for other at-risk structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, leaving them vulnerable today.</p>
