          <p>The offshore yuan has strengthened, breaking past the 7.2 level against the US dollar, signaling market optimism due to expectations of a potential trade war thaw between the US and China. This rise is attributed to hopes that the US and China will begin negotiations to roll back some tariffs. Despite this, uncertainties remain, and global investors are awaiting tangible signs of China's ability to withstand Washington's challenges before significantly increasing their investments. Trump has indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China at some point.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists propose that the "Shi's Star Catalogue" is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335BC. Researchers used image processing to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observation. This would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously considered the oldest. Experts believe detailed study of the night sky began in both China and Greece around the same time.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to, or even surpassing, the United States in several key technologies, particularly artificial intelligence. They emphasize China's advancements in disseminating, commercializing, and manufacturing technology, as well as their aggressive response to recent American tariffs. The authors suggest that the US needs to learn from China's successes by openly sharing more of its AI technologies and research and innovating faster to maintain its competitive edge.</p>
