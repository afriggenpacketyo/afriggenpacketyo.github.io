          <h2>Paris Reopens Seine River for Public Swimming After a Century-Long Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has reopened the Seine River to public swimmers, a legacy project of the 2024 Olympics. The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with amenities, which will be free to access until late August. The original ban, enacted in 1923, was due to severe pollution from sewage and industrial waste, but a €1.4 billion investment in water quality improvement, including a massive underground storage tank, has made swimming safe again. This initiative, championed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo, aims to enhance the quality of life for Parisians and adapt the city to climate change, fulfilling a long-held promise.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:20:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's rugby team narrowly defeated the Maori All Blacks 29-26 in a thrilling opening match of their New Zealand summer tour. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately decided the outcome in Whangarei. The predominantly second-string Scottish side faced a relentless Maori attack but demonstrated clinical finishing and a formidable defense, especially in the final moments. After the Maori All Blacks erased a deficit to make it a three-point game, Scotland held firm through a prolonged defensive stand deep into stoppage time, forcing a turnover to clinch a hard-fought and famous victory on the North Island.</p>

          <p>A new amateur football league in China's Jiangsu province is experiencing a surge in popularity, drawing millions of online viewers and tens of thousands of stadium attendees. The league, in its inaugural season, features 13 teams composed of a diverse mix of players, from teenagers to farmers and middle-aged enthusiasts. This grassroots competition has resonated with fans due to its local nature, celebrating community spirit over professional polish. The enthusiasm is so high that fans have even petitioned the military's Eastern Theatre Command to arrange a fighter jet flyover for the league's final match in November, highlighting its significant cultural impact.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover 'Genetic Switch' for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating a 'genetic switch,' a discovery that could have future implications for human organ regeneration. The study, published in the journal Science, found that mice lost their regenerative ability due to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue repair. By turning on an 'evolutionarily disabled' genetic pathway, the researchers enabled the complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue in the mice's ears. While acknowledging the long road to human application, the Beijing-based team is hopeful, as their findings suggest this regenerative mechanism might also be present in other organs.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a spot in the Club World Cup semi-finals with a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras, but the standout performance came from the Brazilian side's Estevao Willian. The 18-year-old, who has already signed a future deal with Chelsea, scored a spectacular equalizer and was a constant threat, earning man of the match in his final game for Palmeiras. Despite his impressive display, a late own goal by Palmeiras handed the win to Chelsea, who will now face Fluminense. Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, praised Estevao as a 'huge talent,' expressing excitement about his future at the club while acknowledging the adaptation period he will need.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, making him the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented by President Christine Carla Kangaloo during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties. The visit focused on boosting investment in energy, health, and security, building on a relationship rooted in the 19th-century arrival of indentured Indian laborers.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite third baseman Max Muncy suffering a bone bruise in his left knee. While the injury is expected to sideline him for about six weeks, the team was relieved it wasn't a season-ending ligament tear. General manager Brandon Gomes stated the front office will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. With Muncy expected back with over a month remaining before the playoffs, the Dodgers feel no urgent pressure to pursue a high-profile replacement on the trade market, expressing confidence they can weather his temporary absence while he recovers.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led to the temporary closure of a stretch of beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and social media captured footage of sharks swimming unusually close to beachgoers, prompting swift action from city officials to ensure public safety. The New York City Emergency Management drone unit monitored the activity, and the beach was reopened after about an hour. The incident occurred just days after New York's governor reassured the public that enhanced shark surveillance and safety measures were in place at state beaches ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting ongoing efforts to protect swimmers.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases its focus on China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors like South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to step up. South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has campaigned on supporting the domestic sector, which he described as being in a 'major crisis,' and has outlined a policy guide to boost the industry. The new administration's plans focus on developing advanced autonomous and eco-friendly vessels through digitalization and automation. These measures aim to re-establish South Korea as a global maritime power, potentially capturing market share amid shifting geopolitical and trade dynamics affecting China's shipbuilding sector.</p>
