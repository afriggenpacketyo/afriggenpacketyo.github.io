          <p>AMD has revealed its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, slated to ship next year, along with a full server rack called Helios. The Helios system is designed to integrate thousands of chips into a unified, rack-scale system, which AMD CEO Lisa Su compared against Nvidia's Vera Rubin racks. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed enthusiasm for the new chips, indicating his company would use them. AMD is positioning the MI400 chips and the MI355X chips to compete with Nvidia on price and performance, emphasizing lower power consumption and aggressive pricing, as the company aims to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding AI chip market.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a slight decrease following a sharp increase in the previous session, which was driven by fears of a potential conflict between Israel and Iran. President Trump indicated that an attack by Israel on Iran was possible but not imminent, which contributed to the easing of concerns. Earlier, oil prices had surged by over 4% due to fears of supply disruptions, with analysts suggesting prices could spike to $120 per barrel if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz. Despite these concerns, experts believe the likelihood of Iran blocking the strait remains low, as it has never been closed off in recorded history.</p>

          <p>Chime, an online banking company, began trading on the Nasdaq at $43 per share after pricing its IPO above the expected range, valuing the company at $11.6 billion. The IPO raised approximately $700 million, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million in shares. This valuation represents a decrease from the $25 billion valuation in 2021, and Chime's CEO Chris Britt said the company has built a loyal user base by focusing on Americans earning $100,000 or less. Chime reported $518.7 million in revenue for the most recent quarter, a 32% increase year-over-year, with net income narrowing slightly to $12.9 million. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is also creating a lower-cost "Basic" subscription tier to broaden its subscription offerings. William Blair analyst Andrew Jeffrey believes subscription revenue growth will drive long-term investor interest in Coinbase, as the crypto industry anticipates a product launch boom due to pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and clearer regulations from Congress.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Savers are advised to compare CD rates and traditional savings account rates carefully to maximize interest earnings. Certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts offer viable alternatives to traditional savings accounts, particularly in the current high-interest rate climate. The fixed interest rates of CDs provide immunity to rate changes during the term, offering potentially higher returns than traditional savings accounts. A comparison shows that a $5,000 CD can earn significantly more interest than a traditional savings account over various terms, emphasizing the benefit of locking in high CD rates while they are still available.

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and Harvard researcher, was released from US custody on bail after being arrested for smuggling frog embryos into the US. Petrova, who had been detained since February, was accused of lying to federal officers about carrying the samples. She claimed she feared persecution if deported back to Russia for opposing the invasion of Ukraine, and her colleagues at Harvard emphasized her expertise. A judge ruled that immigration officers' actions were unlawful, that Petrova did not present a danger, and that the embryos were non-living and non-hazardous.</p>
