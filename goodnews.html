          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a positive surge, with South Korea's Kospi index reaching a new record high, driven by the announcement of an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. The White House confirmed President Trump's diplomatic tour, which will include discussions with Xi next Thursday during a visit to South Korea. Amid persistent volatility in currency trade, South Korea's finance ministry signaled its readiness to intervene to stabilize the won against the dollar. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and Topix indices also climbed, as the nation's core inflation rate increased to 2.9% in September, meeting economic forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party, following its fourth plenum, has outlined a vision for a "big leap" in technology to bolster its economy over the next five years. Officials elaborated on the Central Committee's commitment to "tech upgrades and self-reliance" as a strategy to overcome significant internal and external challenges. This strategic focus is intended to address "major tests" and "difficulties" amidst a complex global landscape, as the party works towards its medium- and long-term economic and social development benchmarks. The initiative underscores China's determination to strengthen its technological capabilities and reduce external dependencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that China's consistent and long-term strategic planning, underpinned by political stability, is propelling its rapid green energy transition. Western media outlets are noted for their anxiety about this progress, especially when contrasted with the U.S.'s "drill, baby, drill" approach under President Trump. The article highlights China's vast ultra-high-voltage power lines and its commitment to decarbonizing its power grid, aiming for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. China's share of renewable energy in total installed power generation capacity has increased significantly, showcasing a sustained policy continuity in this sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel reported stronger-than-expected revenue for the third quarter, signaling a recovery in demand for its PC processors and causing its stock to jump. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became a top shareholder with an $8.9 billion investment, negotiated by the Trump administration. The chipmaker also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate Intel's CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. Intel anticipates continued demand outpacing supply and is committed to advancing semiconductor production, despite accounting complexities related to government investment and the ongoing government shutdown.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Justice Department superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges. President Trump had publicly called for the criminal charging of Schiff, a prominent critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. MSNBC, citing sources, reported that Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, deemed the case weak, although a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, welcomed the news, calling the allegations politically motivated and baseless, hoping for an end to the matter.</p>
