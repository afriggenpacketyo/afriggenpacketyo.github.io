          <p>President Trump highlighted the Trump Savings Account initiative within the GOP's megabill during a White House roundtable with lawmakers and CEOs. The program aims to provide a $1,000 deposit into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund for each newborn, with potential annual contributions up to $5,000. These accounts are intended to support future expenses like college or home down payments, fostering lifelong success for millions of children, while House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized the transformative potential of this policy for American families. The accounts will be open for additional private contributions from family, friends, employers, churches, private foundations and more. Optimism surrounding the program's potential impact on future generations is tempered by economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, while The New York Times expressed gratitude for the court's protection of honest reporting. While Baldoni can amend claims related to Lively allegedly breaking her contract, the initial defamation claims did not hold up in court because Lively's accusations were part of legal filings and therefore protected.</p>

          <p>Retirees are increasingly exploring home equity as a tool to manage rising costs, with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and reverse mortgages being two popular options. HELOCs function as revolving lines of credit suitable for temporary cash needs and one-time expenses, requiring repayment within a set period. Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, offer a longer-term solution, allowing retirees to borrow money without repayment until they die or sell the home. The choice between the two depends on individual financial circumstances, the intended use of funds, and the ability to repay the loan.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) can help individuals save money in an economy with persistent inflation by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate.

Online banks tend to offer more competitive rates, and short-term CDs can sometimes provide better yields than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by buying some one year, some two years, and some three years, is one way to take advantage of high rates while also saving for the long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, 72% of Chinese travelers are planning European summer trips, a 10% increase from the previous year, driven by growing disposable incomes and favorable travel policies.

          <p>Birthright citizenship, or jus solis, is a foundational ideal of the Americas, granting citizenship to children born within a country's territory regardless of their parents' nationality. This principle, rooted in the rejection of blood-based systems, was first enshrined in Mexico's constitution in 1814 and spread throughout the region as a revolutionary act of inclusion. While the United States eventually adopted birthright citizenship with the Fourteenth Amendment, debates continue over its interpretation, particularly concerning undocumented migrants.
