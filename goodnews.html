          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was reportedly ticketed for speeding and failed to appear in court. Sanders was pulled over for driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone, and previously ticketed in a separate incident. Questions about Sanders' character arose prior to the draft, with concerns raised about his attitude and behavior. Sanders' representatives have stated that he is taking care of the tickets, and he is currently competing for a starting role with the Browns. Optimism remains that he can mature and become a valuable asset to the team.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially due to a high-pressure nitrogen tank failure. The explosion occurred during preparations for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines. This incident is reminiscent of a 2016 Falcon 9 explosion, though SpaceX claims no commonality between the tank designs. The explosion may impact the timeline for the program's tenth integrated flight test, which NASA is relying on for its Artemis moon mission, though NASA has expressed confidence in SpaceX's ability to resolve the issue and move forward with the program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are reducing shoreline pollution. Local and state policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced plastic bag waste collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, and partial bans were the least effective. California's efforts to curb plastic waste have seen mixed results, with a statewide ban initially reducing litter but later leading to an increase in plastic bag waste due to loopholes. New stricter laws with fewer loopholes can make a measurable difference.</p>

          <p>Diego Luna revealed that before his role in 'Star Wars,' he was primarily offered roles as drug dealers in Hollywood. The actor noted that Hollywood productions were not sending messages that he could be himself in roles where he could see himself reflected. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation in Hollywood, although the community remains underrepresented and often depicted in stereotypical roles. Netflix has committed $1 billion to Mexican productions to create more opportunities for Latinx people.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden will speak at a Juneteenth Celebration Service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church in Galveston, Texas. The church is one of the locations where the order announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read in 1865. Biden signed a measure into law in 2021 that made Juneteenth a federal holiday, commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. He said that Juneteenth serves as a day to remember the moral stain and terrible toll that slavery took on the country.</p>
