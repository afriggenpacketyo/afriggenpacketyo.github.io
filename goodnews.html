          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully exited its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD, a position it first acquired in 2008 at the urging of Charlie Munger. The initial $230 million stake had grown immensely in value, with the shares increasing by approximately 3,890% during the holding period. Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022 and has now confirmed the complete divestment. While Buffett has praised BYD, the sale aligns with a broader re-evaluation of geopolitical risks associated with Chinese investments, similar to his quick exit from Taiwan Semiconductor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that genuine toughness, or "grit," is not the absence of emotion but the ability to master and strategically use feelings like anger and fear. It argues against the traditional notion of suppressing emotions, suggesting this leads to brittleness rather than strength. The author references neuroscientific research indicating that acknowledging and naming emotions can enhance self-control and perseverance. The piece advocates for developing emotional intelligence as a crucial skill for navigating life's challenges, framing it as a form of mental training essential for personal and national resilience.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant trilateral military drill, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of an aircraft carrier. This departure from previous exercises has prompted varied analysis regarding its strategic implications for China and North Korea. Some experts suggest the move could be an attempt to de-escalate tensions and facilitate diplomatic engagement with Beijing. Others interpret it as a signal from the Trump administration for Asian allies to assume greater responsibility in regional security as part of a strategy to contain China.</p>

          <p>Apple has unveiled its new A19 Pro chip, which features a significant architectural change by adding neural accelerators to each GPU core to boost on-device AI capabilities. This move, along with the introduction of its first custom wireless chip (N1) and a new modem (C1X), gives Apple control over all core silicon in its iPhone lineup. The strategy prioritizes efficiency, battery life, and privacy by handling more AI tasks directly on the device rather than in the cloud. This vertical integration signals Apple's deep commitment to making the iPhone a premier platform for AI applications while phasing out reliance on suppliers.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for Including Fertility and Reproductive Health in Sex Education Curriculums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues for expanding school-based sex education to include comprehensive information about fertility, not just pregnancy prevention. Many adults, particularly women, are reportedly ill-informed about their own reproductive biology, such as the decline of fertility with age and factors affecting conception. Fertility doctors note that this knowledge gap can lead to misconceptions and difficulties for those who wish to have children later in life. Proponents suggest that a more robust curriculum could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning, such as considering egg freezing or lifestyle changes earlier.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural phenomenon of "RushTok," the TikTok trend that chronicles the sorority recruitment process at major Southern universities like the University of Alabama. It details the highly specific and often expensive fashion, the pressure for "potential new members" to present a perfect image, and the complex social rules governing the process. The piece notes how rush has evolved into a launchpad for social media stardom, while also reinforcing long-standing Southern ideals of social connection and exclusivity. It also touches upon the enduring lack of diversity within these historically white institutions, despite past controversies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With annual fees for premium travel rewards credit cards like the American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve rising to nearly $900 and $800 respectively, experts advise consumers to carefully assess their value. The article suggests that these cards are only worthwhile if the benefits, such as lounge access, travel credits, and points, are fully utilized and outweigh the steep cost. Financial analysts stress that carrying a balance on these cards will quickly negate any rewards due to their high interest rates. Before applying, potential cardholders should consider their travel frequency, brand loyalty, and ability to pay the balance in full each month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article presents a thought experiment, using ChatGPT to analyze what would happen if middle-class families could utilize the same tax deductions as corporations. The AI model concluded that such a policy could significantly lower tax bills for households, freeing up thousands of dollars annually for savings, investment, or debt reduction. This could, in turn, help narrow the wealth gap by allowing more families to build financial security. However, the AI also noted the significant trade-off: a massive reduction in government tax revenue, which could lead to cuts in funding for public services like Social Security and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fight against invasive Asian hornets, which prey on vital pollinators like honeybees, British scientists are employing a new high-tech strategy. They are attaching tiny tracking transmitters to captured hornets, allowing them to follow the insects directly back to their nests. This method drastically reduces the time needed to locate and destroy a colony from several days to about an hour. The effort is crucial as the number of hornet nests found in the UK has hit a record high, and public participation through a reporting app has been vital for rapid response teams.</p>
