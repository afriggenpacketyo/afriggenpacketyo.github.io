          <h2>China's Panda Diplomacy Faces Uncertainty in Japan Amidst Shifting Geopolitical Landscape</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Japan anticipates the potential departure of its giant pandas, China's "panda diplomacy" is under renewed scrutiny. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, experts suggest China may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Japan, a gesture that once symbolized strong bilateral friendship. Despite historical tensions and territorial disputes, the panda remains a beloved symbol in Japan, offering economic benefits through tourism. However, some observers are skeptical about the diplomatic impact of a new panda loan on Japanese policy toward China, noting that the Japanese public's perception of pandas has evolved since their initial arrival in 1972, no longer viewing them through a strictly political lens. The article suggests that China may strategically time a new panda loan to coincide with high-level bilateral talks to foster goodwill, but the gesture's effectiveness in influencing broader diplomatic relations remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Researchers are calling for more robust standards and testing of AI models due to the increasing prevalence of harmful outputs, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The lack of regulations and insufficient testing exacerbate these issues, making it difficult to ensure AI systems behave as intended. Red teaming, a practice involving external experts probing AI systems for potential harm, is suggested as a valuable evaluation method. Researchers recommend standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives to disseminate information, drawing parallels with successful practices in software security to better understand and mitigate risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases to Avoid for Effective Communication with Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding "toxic" phrases like "Because I said so" and "Stop crying." Instead, the expert recommends using language that fosters cooperation and respects a child's autonomy. By explaining decisions, validating emotions, and inviting problem-solving, parents can create an environment where children feel respected and more willing to listen. The alternative phrases aim to shift from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, ultimately promoting emotional resilience in children.</p>

NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage workload and resources, prioritizing those most in need of the medication. While some GP practices caution that few patients will qualify initially, pharmacy organizations express concern that demand will exceed supply. This development marks a significant step in expanding access to weight-loss drugs, but challenges remain regarding training, capacity, and eligibility.</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country being electric. This transformation is attributed to long-term government planning, substantial subsidies, and the development of a comprehensive EV ecosystem. Chinese companies like BYD and CATL are now leading the global EV market, driven by a large domestic market and a culture of innovation. While some Western countries view China's approach as unfair, Chinese EV executives argue that all companies have access to the same resources, fostering a competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian in Scotland is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a recreational drug, has shown potential in treating severe depression by making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. While concerns exist regarding the misuse of ketamine, proponents argue that clinical administration under controlled circumstances poses lower risks and can provide hope for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments.</p>

          <p>A Republican congresswoman in Florida is blaming fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the reluctance of hospital staff to provide her with medication to end an ectopic pregnancy. The congresswoman, Kat Cammack, had to show hospital staff the state law and contact the governor's office before she could receive the medication. The incident highlights concerns that Florida's strict abortion ban, which took effect on May 1, 2024, is creating confusion and fear among medical professionals regarding emergency procedures. The state's healthcare agency has issued guidance to clarify that ectopic pregnancies are exempt from abortion restrictions, but some worry that the law's wording makes medical staff hesitant to provide treatment.</p>
