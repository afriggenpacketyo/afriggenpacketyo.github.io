          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Trump's Authority to Deploy National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Newsom's Challenge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order, allowing President Trump to continue deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are protecting federal property and immigration agents. The unanimous order from the 9th Circuit is a victory for the president, rejecting Newsom's challenge to the federalization of the California Guard. The court found that Trump likely lawfully exercised his authority under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents, with the panel made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee. Newsom expressed disappointment but vowed to continue challenging Trump's use of military soldiers against citizens, while Trump celebrated the decision as a win for his core power to call in the National Guard. The article reflects the legal and political battle over the deployment of federal troops in response to protests. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>China has permitted Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet after a five-year suspension, prompting calls for this resumption to improve Sino-Indian relations amidst ongoing border tensions. The pilgrimage routes to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar are sacred to multiple religions, with the Indian government organizing the journeys. This year, over 5,500 individuals applied, but only 750 will be permitted to travel between June and August.

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures last month and a trade deal with the U.S. that eased growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade-war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, enabling rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. Analysts suggest that the trade truce provides Beijing with some room to support its currency, raising hopes that any economic impact will be less severe than previously anticipated.

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration retains authority over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad, though not unreviewable, power to deploy the military in American cities. California officials vowed to continue fighting the deployment in federal court, while legal scholars noted the court's shift towards a more balanced stance. The ruling focuses on the limits of presidential power and avoids addressing whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion". The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling prevents the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on grant funding related to immigration enforcement and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.
