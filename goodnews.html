          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses report that operating in China has become increasingly challenging, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and perceived depreciation of foreign firms. Despite these issues, British firms remain committed to the Chinese market, seeking a more favorable policy environment with clear and consistently enforced rules. Escalating tensions between China and the US have further complicated matters, causing delays in investments both in China and globally. The British Chamber of Commerce in China emphasizes that removing barriers could distinguish China amidst global economic order disruptions.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, making it the 11th state to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. The law allows mentally capable adults with six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. Meyer emphasized compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice in the final moments of life, marking the end of nearly a decade of debate on the issue.</p>

          <p>BBC Sport correspondents Sami Mokbel and Simon Stone debated whether Manchester United or Tottenham Hotspur had a worse season, ahead of their Europa League final match. Mokbel argued that Tottenham underachieved domestically despite having an expensively-assembled squad, while Stone contended that Manchester United's self-inflicted wounds, including managerial changes and poor performance, made their season worse. Both teams faced challenges, but Stone emphasized United's financial losses and underperformance relative to spending, highlighting it as their worst season since 1973-74.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan, following public and governmental criticism. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable". Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach supports both turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks after Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered seven shutout innings.

Max Muncy's sacrifice fly in the 10th secured the win, salvaging a homestand that was heading towards disaster. The Dodgers maintained their lead in the National League West with the victory.</p>

The deal was all but done, after five meetings with his entourage and Spurs left Fernandes and his people impressed with the north London club's structure. However, the club board changed their mind, holding out for an offer twice as big that never arrived. With the transfer window closing, they made the decision during the Europa League draw in Monaco to sell Raphinha to Rennes instead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The media's focus on young men supposedly driving the rise of the far right is empirically flawed and misses a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. While a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, young women are increasingly turning towards the left. This trend illustrates a male gaze in society, where men's actions and thoughts are deemed inherently important, while the more pronounced generational shift to the left is often overlooked. Centre-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters to transform the political debate.</p>
