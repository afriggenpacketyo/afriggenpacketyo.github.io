The company also provided a positive forecast for the upcoming quarter and the full fiscal year, aligning with or slightly above consensus estimates. Despite the strong performance, which included a 7.6% year-over-year revenue increase, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. Cisco highlighted significant growth in its networking division and noted substantial orders for its artificial intelligence infrastructure, surpassing its annual goal. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, preparing properly for a debt relief program is crucial for success. This article outlines four key steps to take before enrolling. First, a prospective borrower should conduct a thorough review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand their complete financial picture. Second, it is vital to research and understand how different types of debt relief, such as settlement or consolidation, will affect one's credit and overall finances. The third step involves creating a realistic monthly budget to ensure consistent payments can be made. Finally, one should pause all new credit activity to avoid accumulating more debt during the process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Economists Anticipate Federal Reserve Interest Rate Cut in September Amid Economic Signals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 16:26:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are increasingly predicting that the Federal Reserve will implement a quarter-point interest rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. This expectation is fueled by recent economic data, including a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a benign inflation reading, which may give the central bank justification to ease monetary policy to prevent a slowdown. Despite President Trump's persistent public pressure for lower rates, the Fed has held them steady for months, citing concerns over potential tariff-induced inflation. However, with futures markets now pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a cut, the consensus is shifting toward a policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC is reportedly close to completing a deal to sign 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of approximately £26 million. The promising center-half, who is an Italy Under-19 international, has become a key target for the Premier League club as it looks to strengthen its defensive lineup. In addition to the Leoni deal, Liverpool is also in ongoing negotiations with Crystal Palace for their captain and England international, Marc Guehi. These potential acquisitions are part of a significant summer spending spree by the club to bolster its squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, as investors increasingly bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September. This optimism for smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital, contrasted with a slight decline in the value of several megacap technology stocks. The potential for lower borrowing costs is seen as a major benefit for the broader economy and consumer spending. Traders in interest rate futures are now pricing in an almost 100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting, a dramatic shift in market sentiment over the past month.

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service for fresh groceries, making items like meat, eggs, and produce available to customers in more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The company plans to extend this service to at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year. The move is part of Amazon's broader strategy to enhance its grocery business and encourage more frequent shopping on its platform. The announcement had an immediate impact on the market, causing the stock prices of competitors like Instacart, Kroger, and Walmart to fall, escalating the competition in the online grocery sector.</p>

          <p>Walmart is expanding its employee discount program to include nearly all grocery items, a move that comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about inflation. The nation's largest private employer will now offer its 1.6 million U.S. employees a 10% discount on items like milk, meat, and frozen food year-round, extending a benefit that previously applied mainly to produce and general merchandise. In a memo, Walmart's chief people officer stated the company was responding to employee feedback. The expanded discount could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with employee retention during a period of economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is escalating its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near Los Angeles International Airport that directly trolls its competitor. The new sign highlights In-N-Out's drop to fourth place in a national fast-food burger ranking, a decline from its second-place finish last year, which Habit had also advertised. The campaign is a pointed jab, with Habit's CMO noting they are "proudly Californian and not going anywhere," a reference to In-N-Out's owner and corporate expansion moving to Tennessee. This move represents the latest salvo in the so-called California "burger wars," pitting two Irvine-based chains against each other.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners' equity has reached a new record high, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable equity. The average homeowner now holds about $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains that homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of this amount. This financial cushion can be accessed through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. (not investment advice)</p>

Based on current top rates, a money market account at 4.40% APY would earn slightly more over a year—$2,200—compared to a high-yield savings account at 4.35% APY, which would earn $2,175. While the difference is minimal, the article emphasizes that both are vastly superior to traditional savings accounts and allow savers to earn substantial interest without locking up their funds or facing market volatility.

Garman shared that he encouraged his own teenage child to focus on developing critical thinking in college, regardless of their major. He emphasized that while AI can generate ideas, human intellect is still needed to curate and refine them, making this skill more valuable than ever for future workers.</p>
