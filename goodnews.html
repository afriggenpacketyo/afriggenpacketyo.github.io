          <p>A report from the Rand Corporation argues that stabilizing the ongoing rivalry between the United States and China is both possible and mutually beneficial. Researchers suggest that while the two nations are far from transcending their differences, they should seek ways to coexist to avoid escalating tensions to dangerous levels. The report notes that some of China's official statements are not as extreme as often portrayed, indicating an opening for de-escalation if both sides are willing to leverage it. This analysis provides a framework for managing the complex geopolitical relationship over key issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to speak by phone with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to discuss ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. This conversation is seen as a potentially positive development in the U.S.-China relationship, which has been strained by recent tariff threats from President Trump. The dialogue follows Beijing's implementation of new export controls and Washington's subsequent threat of a 100% tariff on certain Chinese imports. The discussion could signal an attempt to de-escalate the trade conflict and find common ground.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has offered deep condolences following the passing of former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, referring to him as an "old friend" of China. Murayama is being remembered for his significant contribution to China-Japan relations, most notably his landmark 1995 statement expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II. He was also the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, a site marking the start of Japan's full-scale war with China. This gesture from Beijing highlights the lasting positive impact of his diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated that despite recent market worries over bad loans at some midsize U.S. banks, there is little evidence of a systemic problem. The assessment points to the overall resilience of the financial system and the broader economy, which has performed better than expected. While acknowledging concerns over loose lending standards, the analyst noted that credit quality remains in a good place and default rates on high-yield debt are low and expected to fall further.

          <h2>Demand Flexibility Programs Proposed as a Tool to Lower US Energy Bills</h2>

          <p>A policy solution known as "demand flexibility" is being proposed as a bipartisan tool to help the U.S. meet its growing energy needs while lowering household power bills. This approach rewards customers with discounts for reducing their electricity consumption during peak demand periods, thereby easing strain on the power grid. Proponents argue that this can help manage the increased demand from AI data centers and electric vehicles, prevent blackouts during extreme weather, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The policy encourages more efficient use of existing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has disabled the ability of its video generation tool, Sora, to create deepfake videos portraying Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This decision followed a public request from Dr. King's daughter, Bernice A. King, and the company acknowledged that such content could be "disrespectful." The incident highlights the growing ethical debate surrounding the use of AI to generate realistic depictions of historical figures, especially in scenarios that could be considered offensive or could distort history. OpenAI stated it is strengthening its guardrails for historical figures while still allowing depictions of other public individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to gain popularity for their low costs and flexibility, financial advisors are cautioning investors about common mistakes that can negatively impact their returns. Key errors include "chasing performance" by investing in funds only after they have seen significant gains and "trend hopping" into volatile thematic ETFs without a long-term strategy. Another frequent oversight is ignoring expense ratios, as even small differences in fees can significantly erode investment gains over time through compounding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team at Tsinghua University in China has developed a groundbreaking imaging chip called Yuheng, which can distinguish colors with approximately 100 times greater sharpness than comparable imagers. This technological advancement overcomes a long-standing trade-off between resolution and efficiency in imaging. The researchers plan to test an engineering model of the chip on the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain, the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope. The technology holds the potential to revolutionize visual intelligence in fields ranging from astronomy and robotics to medical scanning.</p>

          <p>A writer shares her personal story of marrying her partner of 30 years primarily to secure health insurance through his SAG-AFTRA plan, only for that "forever" coverage to be taken away years later. The essay reflects on the illusion of permanence, drawing poignant parallels between the unreliability of insurance policies, the discovery of historical racial covenants on her home's deed, and the ever-present potential for change in laws and relationships. It is a meditation on how life's practicalities, like age and illness, force a pragmatic perspective onto romance and long-term commitment.</p>

          <p>Three men who subscribed to a Nazi-worshipping ideology have been jailed in the UK for preparing acts of terrorism. The extremists were convicted of planning attacks on mosques and synagogues and had amassed an arsenal of over 200 weapons, including machetes, crossbows, and a partially 3D-printed firearm. Their plot, which included targeting an Islamic education center in Leeds, was foiled when undercover officers infiltrated their online group. The judge noted that the men continued to adhere to their extreme right-wing ideology.</p>
