          <p>Google has announced its decision to sign the European Union's voluntary AI guidelines, a move that contrasts with Meta's recent refusal. While Google expressed hope that this would promote access to AI tools in Europe, it also shared concerns that the EU's AI Act could potentially slow down technological development and harm the continent's competitiveness. Meta previously rejected the code, arguing it introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the AI Act, which could stifle innovation in the region.</p>

          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million, signing a four-year contract with the German champions. The 28-year-old, who joined Liverpool in 2022, was a key player, contributing 41 goals in 148 appearances and winning both the FA Cup and EFL Cup. His departure leaves a significant void on Liverpool's left flank, a role that may now be filled by Cody Gakpo or other emerging talents.</p>

          <p>HSBC reported second-quarter pre-tax profits of $6.3 billion, falling short of analyst expectations due to impairment charges and lost income from divested businesses. In response, the banking giant announced a new $3 billion share buyback program. The bank's CEO highlighted structural economic challenges and market volatility as sources of uncertainty, though HSBC stated it is well-positioned to manage these risks. The results reflect ongoing restructuring efforts aimed at simplifying operations and cutting costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay examines the public and social media reaction to New York Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns, particularly the use of the term "zesty" to mock his mannerisms and expressions of joy. The author connects this scrutiny to broader cultural anxieties about Black masculinity, softness, and homophobia, drawing parallels to their own experiences of being policed for not conforming to rigid gender norms. The article argues that despite having the best season of his career, Towns became a target for expressing a form of aesthetic and emotional freedom that unsettles traditional expectations for male athletes.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, its lowest point since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This decline brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range, strengthening the case for another interest rate cut. While the RBA has held its rate steady recently to confirm the downward trend, analysts now widely expect a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming August meeting, supported by the new data and a weaker global growth outlook.

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts and doubling its profit from the previous year. The strong performance was driven by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit and a 12% rise in transaction-based income in wealth management, both benefiting from market volatility. While the bank's net interest income outlook is improving, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients remain in a cautious "wait-and-see" mode amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.

          <p>This analysis explores the recent strong performance of the UK's FTSE-100 stock index, which has outperformed many global peers this year, hitting a new milestone of 9,000. However, the article argues that the index is not a reliable barometer of the UK's domestic economy. Because its constituent companies derive approximately four-fifths of their earnings from overseas, the Footsie's value is heavily influenced by global factors and currency fluctuations, rather than the health of corporate Britain itself, a significant shift from its more domestically-focused composition at its launch in 1984.
