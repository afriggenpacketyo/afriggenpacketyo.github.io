          <p>Former tennis champion Monica Seles has publicly shared her five-year struggle with myasthenia gravis, a rare and incurable autoimmune disease that causes weakness in voluntary muscles. In collaboration with the immunology company argenx, Seles aims to raise awareness about the condition, which can cause symptoms ranging from eyelid drooping to severe difficulty with breathing and swallowing. A neurologist explains that while the disease can be serious, most patients can live fairly normal lives with proper management. Treatments often involve medications that calm the immune system, with newer, more targeted therapies now available.</p>

          <p>Contrary to online rumors, the U.S. government is not distributing new stimulus checks to taxpayers this summer. An IRS official confirmed that Congress has not authorized any new economic impact payments. The confusion may stem from a separate issue where the IRS distributed funds earlier this year to taxpayers who had failed to claim the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit, a process that has since concluded. A recent bill proposed by Senator Josh Hawley to send tax rebates funded by tariffs has been introduced but has not been passed by either the Senate or the House.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is a modern Western that blends documentary and fiction to tell the story of a struggling South Dakota ranch matriarch, Tabatha Zimiga, and her rodeo-star daughter, Porshia. The movie features first-time actors playing versions of themselves, exploring the hardships and resilience required to run a horse rescue operation amid financial uncertainty and personal loss. While the review notes that the film's narrative can feel thin at times, it praises the authentic performances of the Zimiga family and the director's admirable eye for capturing their renegade spirit and the stark beauty of the Badlands.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify a federal takeover of the city's police, reveals that his claims are misleading. While D.C. did have a high murder rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024 and 2025. Data from both the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and independent councils show a substantial decrease in violent crime this year, reflecting a broader national trend of falling crime rates, which the President's statements failed to acknowledge.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has described such an intervention as potentially essential for U.S. national security. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that government involvement is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 6%. While the structure of a potential deal remains unclear, it highlights growing concerns about securing domestic production of critical technologies.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing paying down credit card debt, as average interest rates approach 22%. With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, many consumers are seeking effective strategies to manage their balances, especially since about 45% of adults carry debt on more than one card. The article outlines several debt relief options, including debt forgiveness through settlement, debt management plans from credit counseling agencies, and consolidation loans.

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's narrative style, her use of omniscience, and her central concern with moral and religious themes, stemming from her conversion to Catholicism. The story of Miss Brodie and her chosen students is examined as an investigation into the impressionable nature of adolescence and the lasting influence a charismatic teacher can have. The piece highlights how Spark realistically portrays the complex process of forming one's own identity and moral compass, separate from the powerful figures of childhood.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The tremors, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, are common in this volcanically active area. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these minor quakes are often induced by the operations of the geothermal power facilities located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity can cause stress changes in the surrounding rock, leading to frequent, low-magnitude seismic activity.</p>
