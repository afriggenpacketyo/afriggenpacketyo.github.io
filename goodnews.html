        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's sharp sell-off, fueled by renewed optimism regarding potential trade talks between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 has nearly erased losses incurred after President Trump's initial tariff announcements, with a positive jobs report further bolstering investor confidence. However, concerns remain about the long-term economic impact of the Trump administration's trade policies, as many imports face new taxes and volatility persists. Analysts caution that the damage to economic momentum may already be done, despite potential trade deals.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos intends to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, a stake worth approximately $4.8 billion. The sale is part of a prearranged trading plan adopted in March. This disclosure follows Amazon's recent earnings report, which exceeded estimates but provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for operating income. Bezos has been focusing more on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his climate and biodiversity fund, using Amazon share sales to fund these ventures.</p>

          <p>LeBron James reportedly sustained a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee during Game 5 of the Western Conference first-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, which resulted in the Lakers' elimination from the playoffs. The injury occurred after a collision with Minnesota guard Donte DiVincenzo, forcing James to briefly leave the game for examination. Had the Lakers advanced, the injury would likely have sidelined James for three to five weeks. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists in 70 games this season.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who has been injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that can neutralize the poison from multiple deadly snake species. This discovery is a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom, which could save thousands of lives each year. Friede's unique immunity has allowed researchers to isolate powerful antibodies that, when combined with a neurotoxin blocker, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. The findings offer hope for a more effective and accessible treatment for snakebites worldwide.</p>
