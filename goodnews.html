          <p>Google DeepMind has launched Gemini Robotics On-Device, a new artificial intelligence system that allows robots to perform complex tasks without needing a cloud connection. This model runs directly on the robot's hardware, enabling faster, more reliable operation in environments with poor or no internet, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. The AI can be trained with a small number of demonstrations and is being made available to developers through a trusted tester program. The development marks a significant step toward more autonomous and versatile robots for real-world applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article presents a case for investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, as a strategic move for portfolio diversification and protection against inflation. It argues that gold's tangible nature provides security in an unpredictable economy, and it has become increasingly accessible to purchase from various retailers and online dealers. With gold prices near record highs and predictions of further increases, fractional gold bars and coins are highlighted as a way for new investors to enter the market at a lower price point. This allows for portfolio protection without a massive initial capital outlay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest version of President Trump's domestic policy package, passed by the Senate, would increase the investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This provision is designed to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced chip manufacturing facilities within the United States. The measure builds on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, furthering Washington's goal of onshoring the semiconductor supply chain and reducing reliance on Asia.

          <p>The UK's High Court has ordered a new, independent investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to multiple courts. The ruling came after judges rejected two previous internal reviews as procedurally deficient. The case stems from a BBC investigation that revealed MI5 had lied to courts regarding a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused women. The judges commended the BBC for its role in exposing the misconduct and stated that the new inquiry should be conducted under the oversight of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Sir Brian Leveson.</p>
