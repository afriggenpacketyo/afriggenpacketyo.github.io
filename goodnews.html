        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is updating its relationships, sex, and health education guidance for schools in England. The new curriculum will teach pupils to recognize misogyny, the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes, and unhealthy online attitudes, such as those promoted by "incel" culture. It aims to help students identify positive male role models and will also include age-appropriate discussions on suicide prevention. This revised guidance, which replaces a five-year-old framework, will be implemented this autumn and become legally mandatory by September 2026.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered a notable performance in an NBA Summer League game, drawing significant attention from fans and sports figures, including his father, LeBron James. Despite his strong showing of 17 points, five rebounds, and five assists, the Los Angeles Lakers fell to the rival Clippers with a final score of 67-58. James's growing confidence and skill were on full display, earning praise from the Lakers' coaching staff for his energy and playmaking. The game highlighted his potential impact, even as the team as a whole struggled with shooting and turnovers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The availability of Ireland wing Mack Hansen for the British and Irish Lions' first Test match against Australia is in question due to a foot injury. Conflicting statements from the Lions' coaching staff have created confusion, with one assistant coach initially indicating Hansen was fine while another later admitted he is a doubt. Hansen did not fully participate in Tuesday's training, a key indicator of availability for the upcoming match in Brisbane. The situation is further complicated by suggestions that the 23-man squad may have already been finalized, raising questions about whether he could play even if fit.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing under £37,000. The £650 million program aims to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales by making zero-emission vehicles more affordable. While the initiative is welcomed by some automakers, critics and industry figures highlight the urgent need for more public charging infrastructure, as 40% of UK households lack driveways for home charging. The opposition argues the policy forces families into more expensive vehicles prematurely.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must prioritize energy pragmatism by leveraging its abundant natural gas resources. The author contends that the immense electricity demand from AI data centers cannot be reliably met by current renewable technologies alone, risking the loss of innovation to countries like China. The piece advocates for co-locating natural gas power generation with data centers to provide dedicated, affordable electricity without straining the public grid. It frames this strategy as essential for maintaining America's economic strength and national security.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's recent dominance is being credited to his work with putting coach Phil Kenyon, whom he hired in September 2023. At the time, Scheffler was ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best from tee to green. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a key change was switching to a mallet putter, which sparked a remarkable run of victories, including a second Masters title. Kenyon, who has coached players to all four majors and an Olympic gold, has helped elevate Scheffler's game to a new level.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping the nation on track to meet its 5% annual growth target. However, this represents a slowdown from the first quarter, and underlying data reveals weaknesses, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in real estate investment. Despite resilient industrial output, a key price indicator showed the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis, fueling deflation fears. Economists are now calling for more significant fiscal stimulus and deeper structural reforms to sustain growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which allow them to work legally in the U.S. and shield them from deportation, were set to expire on Monday. The administration had argued that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their return, a claim disputed by advocates who cite the danger under Taliban rule. The court's one-week stay allows both sides to file briefs while the lawsuit challenging the termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroonians proceeds.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 94% of new cars sold so far in 2025 being electric. In cities like Oslo, EVs now constitute up to 40% of all passenger cars on the road, resulting in cleaner air and reduced noise. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of combining generous incentives for EV buyers, such as tax exemptions and reduced fees, with increasingly high taxes on polluting gasoline and diesel cars. A robust public charging infrastructure has also been critical to supporting the widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants. In a controlled experiment, female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. This suggests the moths could perceive the plants as unhealthy hosts for their larvae. The discovery, which builds on the team's previous finding that stressed plants "scream" at frequencies beyond human hearing, opens up a new field of study into a potentially vast and unexplored acoustic ecosystem between plants and animals.</p>
