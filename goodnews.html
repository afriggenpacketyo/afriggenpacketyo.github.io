          <p>The third Test match between England and India is finely poised after three days of play at Lord's. England managed to bowl India out for 387, leveling the first-innings scores, thanks to a late surge where they took the final four wickets for only 11 runs. Key performances included a century from India's KL Rahul and crucial wickets from England's Chris Woakes, while tensions flared between the teams in the final moments of the day. With the series level, the match's outcome remains uncertain as England prepares for their second innings on a slow, challenging pitch.</p>

          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Bogota, Colombia. The capture was the result of a coordinated operation involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. Palermo, who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of managing extensive cocaine shipments and trafficking routes from Latin America to Europe. His arrest highlights the global reach of the powerful 'ndrangheta organization, which is a major importer of cocaine into Europe, amid rising illegal cocaine production in the region.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old displayed composure and experience, capitalizing on her opponent's nervousness, which resulted in numerous errors. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces: clay, hard court, and grass. The result was the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on her previously weakest surface.</p>

          <p>Two fathers have initiated legal action against the UK government, seeking a judicial review of its guidance on smartphone use in schools. Representing a group named Generation Alpha CIC, they argue that the current policy, which allows headteachers discretion, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harms like cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content. The campaigners advocate for a complete ban on smartphones in schools, suggesting simple "brick phones" for necessary communication instead. The Department for Education maintains that schools already possess the authority to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>As Nvidia's stock continues its strong performance after becoming the first company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization, CNBC's Jim Cramer has offered a clear message to investors. In a social media post, he advised, "Please own it, don't trade it," emphasizing a long-term holding strategy for the chipmaker's stock. Nvidia has seen remarkable growth fueled by the generative AI boom, with its stock gaining 171% in 2024 and nearly 24% so far in 2025. This sustained rally comes despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions on its advanced chips to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AccuWeather meteorologists are tracking two areas in the Atlantic Basin for potential tropical storm formation in mid-July. One system, a stalling front off the Southeast coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, presents a low risk of development but is expected to bring increased rainfall and rough surf to the region. A second area of low pressure, located north of Bermuda, also has a slight chance of forming into a subtropical system, though it is not expected to impact land. These developments come after an active start to the 2025 hurricane season, which is already ahead of the historical average for named storms.</p>

Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a nationwide wave of violence. During a virtual court hearing, he agreed to the extradition, a process that now requires final approval from Ecuador's president. This would mark the first extradition from Ecuador since a recent referendum approved the measure as part of the government's war against powerful criminal gangs.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep-space exploration program, presenting the most significant challenge to U.S. dominance in space in decades. The country is aiming to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing stages. This progress puts China's timeline in direct competition with NASA's Artemis program, which targets a crewed lunar landing no earlier than 2027 but faces significant technical challenges. The intensifying space race is highlighted by recent increased U.S. funding for its own moon exploration efforts.</p>
