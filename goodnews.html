          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing significant medical debt, this article outlines several potential avenues for relief. The primary options include hospital charity care programs, which federal law requires for nonprofit hospitals, often benefiting those with incomes below certain federal poverty level percentages. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate lower balances, though this may impact credit scores. As a final resort, bankruptcy offers a comprehensive but severe solution for overwhelming debt, highlighting the importance of exploring all available options.</p>

          <p>AQR Capital Management, the quantitative investment firm founded by Cliff Asness, has reported strong performance for the first half of 2025, with several of its hedge funds achieving double-digit returns. The firm's Apex and Delphi funds saw gains of 11.4% and 11.6% respectively, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 5.3% year-to-date increase. This success comes amid a volatile market influenced by trade wars and geopolitical tensions.

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of babies born in England and Wales to fathers aged 60 and over increased by 14.2% in 2024. This trend is part of a broader pattern of people starting families later in life, as births to parents under 30 continued to decrease. Overall, the total number of births in England saw a slight rise for the first time since 2021, though the number fell in Wales. Experts find the rise in older fatherhood particularly interesting given the natural decline in male fertility with age.</p>

          <p>Suzy Welch, an NYU Stern professor, suggests that job seekers can cut through corporate platitudes by asking a specific question during interviews: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" She argues that this question often elicits more honest and revealing answers about a company's true values than direct inquiries. The article provides examples of candid responses students have received, such as "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends," which expose the real work culture. This approach helps candidates assess whether a company is a genuine fit for their personal and professional values.</p>

          <p>Ford announced that its second-quarter vehicle sales rose by 14.2% compared to the previous year, a figure that far exceeds the estimated 1.4% growth for the auto industry as a whole. The company sold over 612,000 new vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019. While sales of electrified vehicles, including hybrids and EVs, grew overall, pure EV sales saw a significant drop of 31.4%, offset by a 23.5% rise in hybrid sales. The strong results come amid economic uncertainty and the recent implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Labor Department reported that job openings unexpectedly rose to 7.8 million in May, up from 7.4 million in April and surpassing economists' expectations. This data suggests the American labor market remains robust despite challenges from high interest rates and uncertainty over trade policy. The report also showed a modest increase in the number of Americans quitting their jobs, a sign of worker confidence, while layoffs decreased. Although hiring has decelerated from its post-pandemic peak, the continued high number of vacancies indicates persistent demand for labor in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies "front-loading" inventory before the tariffs took effect and some businesses absorbing the initial cost increases to avoid losing customers. Additionally, importers have utilized loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments, resulting in effective tariff rates being lower than the announced figures. However, experts warn that prices could still rise later in the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

It suggests that AMD is well-positioned to benefit from the expanding AI market, while Carnival's business is recovering strongly post-pandemic with record revenue and bookings. The main challenge for Carnival remains its large debt load, but the analysis posits that this should be manageable over the next decade. The piece argues that both companies show strong fundamentals that could lead to significant returns for patient investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the evolution of kink as a literary genre, moving from a taboo subject to a mainstream category with its own established canon. It contrasts the fantasy-driven exploration in fiction with nonfiction's trend toward demystifying and normalizing BDSM, emphasizing consent and safety. The piece provides a detailed review of Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core," praising it as a work that skillfully explores the psychology of kink and sex work while maintaining its intrigue. The review positions the novel within the broader cultural project of seeking legitimacy and acceptance for previously pathologized sexual practices.</p>
