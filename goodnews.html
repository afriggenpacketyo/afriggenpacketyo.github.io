          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor and former mathematics professor, has won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Preliminary results show Dan with 54% of the vote, calming fears that Romania might align with countries opposing aid to Ukraine. Simion has alleged electoral fraud and called for protests, mirroring Trump's "stop the steal" efforts. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO, appealing to voters seeking a middle path between polarized political camps.</p>

          <p>In Arizona, TSMC is building a factory to mass-produce advanced semiconductors in the U.S. for the first time, a move influenced by tariffs and supply chain concerns. This facility is considered crucial for maintaining US economic and military superiority over China, relying on global technologies. The factory, closely guarded to protect intellectual property, aims to create the cleanest environment on Earth to manufacture intricate 4-nanometer chips. The expansion is partly attributed to Trump's policies and the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, marking a complex interplay of global economics and geopolitics.</p>

The two will compete in a runoff, where Trzaskowski faces an uphill battle given the combined vote share of right-wing candidates.
