          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from entering their stadium during a game.  ICE denied its agents were present, while the Department of Homeland Security stated that Customs and Border Protection vehicles were briefly on the premises for an unrelated matter.
