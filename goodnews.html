        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the Italian Grand Prix, McLaren instructed Oscar Piastri to yield second place to teammate Lando Norris, sparking controversy. The decision was made after a slow pit stop, caused by a team error, unfairly dropped Norris behind Piastri, who had been trailing for most of the race. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the move, stating it was consistent with McLaren's core principles of fairness, even as it impacts the close intra-team championship battle. This incident highlights the team's unique culture of prioritizing collective values over individual race outcomes, a strategy that has defined their recent success in Formula 1.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump hosted the first event in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, which he dubbed the "Rose Garden Club." The event, attended by Republican lawmakers, featured a formal dinner and a speech from the president. However, the new design, featuring manicured lawns, paved walkways, and patio-style furniture, drew widespread ridicule online. Social media users compared the new look unfavorably to the patios of chain restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory and Au Bon Pain, with many expressing a desire to see it restored to its previous state.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of government data reveals large disparities in lottery ticket spending among U.S. states, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 annually. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. The report, from LendingTree, suggests that accessibility in urban areas may contribute to higher spending in states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island. For some states, lottery sales represent a significant source of public funds, accounting for up to 3% of general revenue, highlighting the financial importance of these games of chance.</p>

          <p>Following a soft jobs report that increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, investors are now focusing on upcoming inflation data. The Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports will be critical in shaping the Fed's decision at its September meeting. In the tech sector, all eyes are on Apple's annual hardware event, where the company is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup. Analysts suggest a new, thinner model and potential price increases could be key factors for the company's performance amid sluggish recent growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that "tens of millions of phones successfully sounded," calling it an important step for public safety. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events such as severe weather or major security incidents, and has been used for real warnings five times since its first test.</p>

She personally consumes 130 grams of protein daily, focusing on sources like animal meat, eggs, and dairy to build and maintain muscle mass. Her diet is rich in green leafy vegetables, including kale salads for breakfast, and she strictly avoids sugar and simple carbohydrates, which she says cause inflammation and "dullness in my brain." Dr. Wright's approach emphasizes anti-inflammatory nutrition as a key pillar for physical and cognitive health later in life.</p>

Because the driver had previously always worn a full racing helmet, police were unable to identify him. The vehicle, believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, is not street legal, and the owner now faces fines and a potential license suspension.</p>

The Green Party politician will chair and manage UN meetings for the next year, a position that involves extensive closed-door diplomacy and preparation for next year's Secretary-General election. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, a move seen as a reaction to her strong criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock has stated her intention to act as a "unifier" and an "honest broker" for all 193 member states.</p>

The voyage, which took 12 hours, is believed to be the world's longest in a vessel made from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi. Shoemaker and other innovators are exploring this buoyant, biodegradable material, termed AquaFung, as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastics used in boats and surfboards.

          <p>An analysis piece argues that while the end of the "de minimis" trade exemption will raise prices for some imported goods, the resulting panic is overstated. The author contends that this tariff change affects only a small fraction of U.S. small businesses, most of which are service-based and do not import goods directly. The greater concern, according to the article, should be the overall health of the labor market and consumer purchasing power. As long as income and wealth continue to grow, the economy can likely absorb the price increases from these specific tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
