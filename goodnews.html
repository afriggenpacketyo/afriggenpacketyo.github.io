          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework after high-level talks in London, now pending approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and the recent call between the two leaders, stabilizing a relationship strained by accusations of trade agreement violations. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump on the deal. While the framework signals a commitment to de-escalate and continue dialogue, the outcome of concrete agreements remains uncertain. The agreement is a step forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hall of Famer Tim Brown, now commissioner of The Arena League, proposes eliminating kickers from the NFL, drawing from his experience in arena football where kickers are absent. Brown argues that removing kickers would speed up the game and enhance its entertainment value, suggesting a throw-off instead. The NFL has already made changes to kickoff rules, and the United Football League has removed kicking for points after touchdowns. Any rule change in the NFL requires approval from 24 of the 32 team owners. The change could potentially lead to a faster-paced and more exciting game.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025 after a slowdown last year, with registrations surging by 20% from January to April. The recovery is primarily driven by corporate sales spurred by an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions. However, consumer enthusiasm for EVs remains stagnant, with concerns over battery range and charging infrastructure persisting. While Tesla's sales have plummeted, Chinese brands like BYD are gaining ground, intensifying competition in the European auto market. The industry faces new challenges, including potential tariffs on cars exported to the United States, as threatened by US President Donald Trump.</p>
