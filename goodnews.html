          <h2>Women's Africa Cup of Nations Kicks Off Amidst Familiar Off-Field Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but also highlighting persistent issues holding the tournament back. Morocco is emerging as a hub for women's football on the continent, hosting for the second consecutive time, yet the event suffers from last-minute scheduling and the use of smaller stadiums. Financial disputes, such as those affecting the South African team, and a significant pay gap compared to the men's tournament underscore the challenges. Despite these hurdles, the growing talent and on-field competition suggest this could be the most compelling WAFCON yet.</p>

          <h2>FIFA Considers Expanding Club World Cup Amidst Commercial Success and Player Welfare Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:00:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is already considering expanding the tournament to 48 teams by 2029 and is facing calls to hold it more frequently. The event, bankrolled by a significant prize fund, has proven commercially successful, generating over $2 billion in revenue and attracting large viewership, particularly in Brazil. However, this success is shadowed by unresolved concerns over player welfare, with complaints about extreme heat and playing conditions. While FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision for a bigger tournament appears vindicated financially, the impact on players remains a contentious issue.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Update Sex Education Guidance to Include Anti-Misogyny and Consent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to tackle misogyny, consent, and the dangers of AI-generated "deepfakes." The updated curriculum aims to teach pupils to identify positive male role models and recognize unhealthy attitudes, including those promoted by online influencers. Unlike a previous draft, the new guidance will not impose strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. The changes, which will be fully implemented by 2026, also emphasize proactive engagement with parents, who will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered one of his strongest NBA Summer League performances, drawing significant attention from a crowd that included his father, LeBron James, and numerous sports dignitaries. Despite his impressive showing of 17 points, five rebounds, and five assists, the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Los Angeles Clippers 67-58. James demonstrated growing confidence, particularly with his shooting, and provided a spark for his team. However, the Lakers struggled overall with poor shooting and turnovers, while Clippers forward Jordan Miller's clutch performance secured the win for his team.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new £650 million scheme to encourage the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible new cars. The grants, which will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, are designed to make zero-emission cars more affordable for working families ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, it also highlights the need for a significant expansion of the public charging infrastructure. Critics argue the policy forces families into more expensive vehicles before the country is fully prepared.</p>

          <p>China is expected to issue a record number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, with 166 new funds launched in the first half of 2025 alone. This pace puts the country on track to surpass its 2021 record of 277 ETF launches. The surge is driven by a combination of favorable regulations, including streamlined approvals and lower fees, and strong investor demand for diversified investment products. Most of the new ETFs track domestic stock indexes, bonds, and overseas markets, reflecting a growing appetite for such instruments within mainland China's financial landscape.

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, the positive headline figure was accompanied by signs of underlying weakness, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite resilient industrial output, persistent deflationary pressures and soft consumer spending have fueled calls for further government stimulus and deeper structural reforms. Officials acknowledged the need to boost domestic income to sustain a rebound in spending and stabilize the property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the expiration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The Trump administration had moved to end the protections, which allow them to work legally and shield them from deportation, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved. Immigrant advocacy groups sued to block the revocation, and the court's intervention keeps the status in place for at least another week while it considers the case. The move to end TPS for Afghans has been criticized by advocates who argue it is not safe to return, especially for those who assisted the U.S. during the war.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with EVs accounting for over 93% of new car sales so far in 2025. This success is the result of long-standing government policies that combine significant tax exemptions and incentives for EVs with progressively higher taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, leading to cleaner air and quieter cities, demonstrating a successful model for other nations to follow.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is billed as the world's largest wooden city, with an investment of approximately $1.25 billion. The project in the Sickla area will use cross-laminated timber to construct thousands of new homes, offices, and schools, aiming to showcase a more sustainable model for urban development. The construction sector is a major source of global carbon emissions, and using mass timber can reduce a building's climate impact significantly compared to steel and concrete. The project reflects Sweden's deep cultural connection to its forests and a growing industry trend toward using wood as a primary building material.</p>

The potential reversal follows intensive lobbying by Nvidia's CEO and a preliminary trade framework agreement between Washington and Beijing.

The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to open in Ohio in 2026, while another, Hyperion, will be built in Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of the data center clusters could eventually cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan and scale up to five gigawatts of power. This massive investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading in AI, though it also raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to the ultrasonic sounds produced by plants. In a controlled experiment, female moths avoided laying their eggs on tomato plants that were making noises associated with distress, such as dehydration, suggesting they perceived the plants as unhealthy. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes, which can be heard by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of study into a potential invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication between plants and animals.</p>
