          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, fueled by a standout performance from running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for a career-high 170 yards. Robinson's 81-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, the longest in the NFL this season, was a pivotal moment in the game. Despite a comeback attempt by Bills quarterback Josh Allen, the Falcons' defense held strong, securing the win with a late interception. The loss marks the second consecutive defeat for the Bills, raising questions about the strength of their 4-2 record.</p>

          <p>A former RAF navigator and lawyer named Tina has found a new voice by learning British Sign Language (BSL) after a traumatic brain injury left her struggling to speak. The injury, sustained in a fall in 2018, significantly impacted her communication abilities and confidence. Featured in a BBC series, she and other residents of her retirement village learned BSL, which she says helps her recall words and express herself when speech fails. Her husband Mark now leads practice sessions, demonstrating the profound and unexpected benefits of BSL for those beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>During Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers turned an unusual and critical double play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With the bases loaded, a long drive to center field by Max Muncy bounced off the outfielder's glove and hit the wall. In the ensuing confusion, the Brewers' defense managed to get a force out at second base, while a baserunning error by the Dodgers allowed the catcher to tag third base for the final out, ending the inning without any runs scored for Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts, though this marks a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was primarily driven by the services sector, while manufacturing flattened. Despite the positive current data, the country's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), warned that GDP growth is expected to moderate in 2026 as global trade headwinds persist and economic activity normalizes. The MAS held its monetary policy steady, anticipating that core inflation will ease in the near term before gradually rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attitudes in Vietnam towards China are softening, particularly among the youth, influenced by social media platforms like TikTok and escalating trade tensions with the United States. This shift is enabling closer bilateral projects that were previously controversial due to historical conflicts and anti-China sentiment. Polling data indicates a growing preference for China as a partner, and social media trends show positive engagement with Chinese culture and military content. While deep-seated nationalism remains, economic interests and a pragmatic government approach appear to be prevailing, fostering a more complex and ambivalent relationship between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte humorously commented on the state of Russia's naval fleet, referring to a Russian submarine as "limping" home and in need of a mechanic. The diesel-powered submarine Novorossiysk was tracked by the Royal Navy and escorted by the Dutch navy as it passed through the English Channel and North Sea. While Russia claimed the submarine surfaced to comply with navigation rules, reports from Dutch authorities and other sources suggested it was under tow due to technical problems, including a potential fuel leak. The incident highlights the degraded state of some Russian military assets.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has successfully conducted the 11th test flight of its Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The vehicle launched from Texas, with its booster performing a controlled descent into the Gulf of Mexico while the main spacecraft traveled halfway around the world before entering the Indian Ocean. This successful flight marks another critical step in SpaceX's plan to create a fully reusable transportation system for missions to the Moon and Mars. The Starship is integral to NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 other world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to formally sign a declaration supporting a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free driving law, making it one of 32 states to ban holding cellphones while driving. The legislation was championed by advocates like Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. To better enforce the law and target problem areas, the state's Department of Transportation is using anonymized data from smartphones and vehicles to identify distracted driving hot spots. This data-driven approach aims to reduce the number of accidents, as officials believe distracted driving contributes to nearly one in three fatal crashes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to significantly increase the pay for incarcerated individuals who volunteer to fight California's wildfires. The new law raises their hourly wage from approximately $1 to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. These prison fire crews perform dangerous and physically demanding work, such as clearing brush and digging containment lines, and are a crucial part of the state's wildfire response. The pay raise addresses a long-standing social justice issue concerning the low compensation for this hazardous labor, though the wage remains well below California's statewide minimum.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to create a commission to study inequalities in youth sports access across California. The commission will examine barriers related to race, gender identity, disability, income, and location. The legislation drew criticism from some Republicans who argued its focus on "gender identity" was a veiled attempt to promote the inclusion of transgender athletes in girls' sports. This move comes after Newsom himself had previously commented on the issue, calling the participation of transgender women in women's sports "deeply unfair," highlighting the complex and contentious nature of the topic.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles-based musician and composer San Cha is premiering her new experimental opera, "Inebria me," which deconstructs and queers the classic narrative structure of a telenovela. The 90-minute performance expands on her 2019 album, telling the story of a humble bride, a jealous husband, and a genderless spirit of empowerment. Drawing inspiration from her upbringing watching Spanish-language soap operas and her experiences in underground drag scenes, San Cha blends ranchera music with electronic and pop influences. The work explores themes of religion, sin, and liberation through a unique and visually compelling lens.</p>
