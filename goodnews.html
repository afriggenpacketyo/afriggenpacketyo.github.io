          <h2>Trump Administration Supports Dismissal of Lawsuit Seeking to Restrict Abortion Pill Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:24:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, echoing the Biden administration's earlier stance, has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit aimed at restricting access to mifepristone, an abortion pill. The Justice Department argues that the case, brought by conservative attorneys general, lacks the legal standing to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit seeks to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery. This marks the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on the case, aligning with the previous administration's view that the lawsuit's venue is inappropriate.</p>

Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Megan Thee Stallion donned looks reflecting the theme's focus on the importance of clothing and style to the formation of Black identities. The dress code, "Tailored for You," paid homage to the exhibition's emphasis on menswear and the legacy of Black sartorial innovation.

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled the migrant tent camp at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, just three months after its establishment, despite initial plans to house up to 30,000 migrants. The operation, which never expanded to its intended capacity, housed only 32 migrants at the time of dismantling, far fewer than envisioned. The decision to remove the tents indicates a shift in plans, with the Defense and Homeland Security Departments now focusing on housing dozens of ICE detainees rather than thousands. The tents and equipment have been inventoried for possible future use, and the operation has faced criticism for its high costs and questionable legal authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several individuals are actively resisting the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their lives and businesses, citing concerns ranging from environmental impact to the erosion of critical thinking skills. Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, emphasizes the contradiction between AI's soulless nature and her business's focus on human connection, as well as the environmental cost of running AI data centers. Sierra Hansen, working in public affairs, worries that AI is hindering our ability to problem-solve independently. However, some, like Jackie Adams in digital marketing, have had to adopt AI due to budget cuts and job requirements, finding that it can elevate their work. The article concludes that the moment to fully opt out of AI has passed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that receiving a shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The study, which examined over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in those who received the vaccine. The protective effect was particularly pronounced in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. The researchers propose that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, which can contribute to heart disease.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The automaker anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, but cites potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance. The tariff impact is less than that expected by General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles. The automotive industry is currently grappling with 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and non-USMCA compliant auto parts.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he considers one of the most important of his career, highlighting the critical role of oceans in combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. The film documents the catastrophic decline in ocean life and the damaging effects of practices like bottom trawling. Despite the grim realities, Attenborough emphasizes the ocean's remarkable capacity to recover, particularly citing the resurgence of whale populations after the whaling ban. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take decisive action to protect the world's oceans and promote a healthier marine ecosystem.</p>
