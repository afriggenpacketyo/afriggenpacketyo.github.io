          <p>This weekend, Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game, officiating a series between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves. The 48-year-old from New Jersey has been working in minor league baseball since 2016 and has participated in MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her historic debut follows in the footsteps of other female pioneers who broke officiating barriers in major men's professional sports leagues. The article highlights other trailblazers, such as Sarah Thomas in the NFL and Violet Palmer in the NBA, who paved the way for women in officiating roles.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July revealed surprisingly strong growth, with exports increasing by 7.2% and imports rising by 4.1% compared to the previous year, both figures surpassing economists' expectations. The import growth marks the largest jump in a year, suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand, while robust exports continue to be a key pillar supporting the Chinese economy. This positive economic signal comes as a tariff truce with the United States approaches its expiration date. Despite the strong trade figures, other data indicates a slowdown in factory activity, presenting a mixed outlook for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The mission, co-piloted with astronaut Suni Williams, was troubled by thruster outages and gas leaks, extending their planned eight-day stay on the International Space Station to over nine months. NASA ultimately deemed a return on the Starliner too risky, and the astronauts came home on a SpaceX capsule instead. Despite the mission's issues, Wilmore's career is being celebrated for his dedication and legacy of fortitude in human space exploration.</p>

          <p>Eddie Palmieri, the influential pianist and bandleader whose innovative style helped shape modern Latin music, has died at the age of 88. Known for his highly percussive and full-bodied piano technique, Palmieri and his orchestra, La Perfecta, fused Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz stylings in the 1960s and 70s, creating iconic tracks like "Azúcar Pa' Ti." Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, he became a central figure in the city's burgeoning salsa scene. Over his long career, Palmieri won multiple Grammy awards and was recognized as a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Humanities for his groundbreaking contributions to music.</p>

          <p>Glorya Kaufman, the philanthropist whose immense generosity reshaped the landscape of dance in Los Angeles, has died at 95.

          <p>In a wide-ranging BBC interview, UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch shared a formative childhood experience where she publicly accused a fellow student of cheating on an exam, which resulted in his expulsion. She used the anecdote to illustrate her deep-seated aversion to rule-breaking, a principle she says has shaped her character and political outlook. Badenoch also discussed her upbringing in Nigeria, her return to the UK, and her views on the "poverty of low expectations" she encountered from some teachers toward Black children in the 1990s. The interview provides insight into the personal history influencing one of Britain's leading political figures.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, albeit brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl for a week of performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut, featured a savvy program blending the music of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho as the soloist. The review praises the orchestra's ability to handle the jazzy, swinging orchestrations of Ellington's work, a feat few classical orchestras can achieve. The homecoming was described as both joyous and bittersweet, as Dudamel's planned tour with his Venezuelan youth orchestra was canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <h2>Apple Pledges Additional $100 Billion in US Manufacturing Amid Tariff Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 20:24:27 EDT</div>

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who has heavily criticized the company for its reliance on overseas production, particularly in China and India. This move is widely seen as an effort by Apple to mitigate the impact of threatened tariffs on its products, which rely on a complex global supply chain. The new investment aims to bring more component production to the U.S., a goal the president hailed as a step toward American-made iPhones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Introduce Licensing Scheme for Cosmetic Procedures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 20:02:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to crack down on the unregulated cosmetic procedures industry by introducing a new licensing scheme for practitioners. Under the proposals, high-risk treatments like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals, while clinics offering Botox and dermal fillers will need a license to operate. The new rules also aim to protect minors from dangerous social media trends by implementing age restrictions on certain procedures. While the industry has welcomed the move for enhanced safety, the regulations will require further consultation and parliamentary approval before coming into force.</p>
