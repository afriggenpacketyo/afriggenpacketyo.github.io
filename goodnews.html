          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, amounting to $26 billion, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production, despite slightly surpassing analyst expectations. The company's free cash flow also experienced a downturn, falling from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion compared to the same period last year. While the base dividend increased by 4.2% to $21.1 billion, the performance-linked dividend payout was significantly reduced to $200 million. These figures indicate ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant amidst sluggish crude prices and slowing global demand.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa toward renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's overall energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled $66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with China's global trend of moving away from fossil fuels to renewables, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>

          <p>A senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, Mathilde Ross, argues that the pressure on mothers to be perfect is harmful and unrealistic, and that being flawed is an essential part of motherhood. She notes that psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking their crucial contributions. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack, reassuring them that they are good enough and highlighting the importance of imperfection in teaching children to accept their own flaws. The article serves as a reminder that mothers do not need to be perfect to be good parents.</p>
