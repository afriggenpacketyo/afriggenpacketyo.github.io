          <p>Since taking control of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has moved quickly to reshape the company's strategy. Key initiatives include a massive $7.7 billion deal to secure exclusive U.S. rights for the UFC, making its events available on Paramount+. Ellison is also greenlighting new franchises, such as a film based on the 'Call of Duty' video game, and is reportedly preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. These aggressive investments in sports and content aim to reverse years of underinvestment and reposition Paramount as a major player in the entertainment industry.</p>

The twins believe there is still significant room for growth, stating that from its current price of over $115,000, there is 'easily a 10x from here.' (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic is causing a noticeable shift in the apparel industry, particularly in the resale market. Consignment stores are reporting a surplus of larger-sized clothing and a rising demand for smaller sizes, a phenomenon they term the 'Ozempic effect.' While some retailers are adjusting by stocking fewer extended sizes in-store, experts note the plus-size market remains underserved. The long-term impact on clothing manufacturing will depend on the continued accessibility and adoption of these drugs by the broader population.</p>

          <p>Analysts view the forthcoming trade talks in Madrid between the U.S. and China as a potentially decisive moment for the fragile economic truce between the two nations. With a temporary tariff pause set to expire in November, the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng is critical. A lack of concrete progress could jeopardize the possibility of a presidential summit between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The discussions are seen as essential to determine whether the two sides can achieve a lasting settlement rather than another temporary extension.</p>

          <p>A potential merger between Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery is being explored as a strategic move to create a media giant capable of competing with industry leaders like Netflix and Disney. This analysis suggests the combination would provide much-needed scale, merging vast content libraries including DC superheroes, 'Game of Thrones,' and major sports rights with Paramount's assets. The deal could also generate significant cost savings and increase bargaining power, though it faces major hurdles, including the combined entity's massive debt load and potential regulatory scrutiny from the Trump administration.</p>

The new inquiry aims to uncover the truth about what happened in 'room 619' of the Port Elizabeth prison.

          <p>With the Social Security trust fund projected to be depleted in about eight years, this article explores reform options that avoid disproportionately harming poorer Americans. A key issue is that raising the retirement age for everyone is a regressive policy, as lower-income individuals have shorter life expectancies and thus receive benefits for fewer years. A proposed solution from the Brookings Institution suggests a targeted approach: raise the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners. This, combined with other progressive benefit adjustments and tax hikes, could ensure the program's solvency.</p>

          <p>As demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to surge, financial experts are cautioning investors against several common pitfalls. One major error is failing to 'look under the hood' to understand the specific assets within an ETF, which can lead to unintended risks. Another frequent mistake is 'chasing performance' by investing in funds based solely on strong past returns, which are not guaranteed to continue. Experts also warn against excessive trading, as frequent buying and selling can erode the low-cost and tax-efficient benefits that make ETFs attractive for long-term goals.
