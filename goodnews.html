          <p>The Trump administration has revised its "reciprocal" tariff rates for numerous countries, prompting varied reactions across Asia. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief over significant reductions in their duties, viewing it as beneficial for their economies and a sign of strong U.S. relations. In contrast, Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff pending further negotiations, while India, having not secured a deal, will be subject to a 25% rate. The adjustments create a complex landscape of economic uncertainty and diplomatic maneuvering for America's key trading partners in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, some of whom have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for decades. In her decision, the judge stated that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing public statements by the president. The administration has argued the program was meant to be temporary and that conditions in the home countries have improved.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of its emergency docket, which has seen a surge in appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents increasingly use executive orders, courts are inevitably drawn in to decide on their immediate implementation. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has made internal changes to improve its process. Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices, describing his colleagues as patriots operating in good faith even amid strong disagreements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers secured a 34-7 victory over the Detroit Lions in the NFL's Hall of Fame Game, offering an early look at players competing for roster spots. Quarterback Trey Lance, now with his third team, delivered a polished performance with 120 passing yards and two touchdowns, strengthening his case for the backup position. Other key takeaways from the article include the promising play of undrafted rookie cornerback Nikko Reed, who had a significant interception, and ongoing concerns about the interior of the Chargers' offensive line.

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. While slightly ahead of analyst expectations, this growth rate trails behind competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which are aggressively investing in artificial intelligence. AWS remains the market leader and a major profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the company's focus on security and privacy as key differentiators, while also acknowledging that supply shortages for AI infrastructure, particularly power, remain a challenge.

          <p>The White House has announced plans for a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a $200 million project President Trump aims to complete before the end of his term. The new building is intended to provide a permanent, suitable venue for large-scale events, which currently require the use of tents on the South Lawn. According to the White House, funding for the addition will be provided by President Trump and other "patriot donors," with the president describing it as "his gift to the country." This would be the first major structural change to the executive mansion itself since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's highly successful initial public offering, four major venture capital firms are holding a combined stake valued at approximately $24 billion. The company's stock soared 250% on its first day, pushing its market capitalization to nearly $68 billion, a significant outcome for a tech market that has seen few major IPOs in recent years. This success comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through due to regulatory concerns. The blockbuster debut is seen as a positive sign for the tech industry, potentially encouraging more companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Trace Potato's Origin to Ancient Hybridization with a Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell suggests that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancestor of the tomato. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, but this research indicates a hybridization event around 9 million years ago was the key. The ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while the wild potato ancestor contributed a gene that helps control the growth of the underground stems. This discovery highlights how hybridization between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has revealed a £49 billion expansion plan, primarily funded by private finance, that includes a third runway, a new terminal, and significant infrastructure modernization. The airport's CEO stated the expansion is "urgent" to alleviate current capacity constraints and enhance the UK's trade and connectivity. While business groups have welcomed the proposal, it faces strong opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor over concerns about increased noise, air pollution, and the impact on climate change targets. A rival, lower-cost proposal has also been submitted, setting the stage for a contentious review process.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, surpassing analyst estimates. The iPhone, Mac, and Services divisions all showed robust performance, with the company setting a new record for its installed base of active devices. Despite the positive earnings, the article notes that investor enthusiasm was tempered by a lack of new details regarding the company's artificial intelligence strategy. While CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the importance of AI and ongoing investment, the company has yet to provide a clear roadmap, leaving Apple as an AI "show me" story for Wall Street.

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. Congressman, will be the first monument honoring an individual African American on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. The project, which resulted from a bipartisan push by state lawmakers, aims to help complete the historical narrative represented at the state capitol, where most existing statues honor white men. The 12-foot sculpture is being created by artist Basil Watson and will depict Smalls, a champion of civil rights, elevated on a platform of books to symbolize his journey from illiteracy to a pioneering statesman.</p>
