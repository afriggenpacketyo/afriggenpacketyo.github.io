          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the requirement for passengers in standard screening lines to remove their shoes at select U.S. airports. This change marks a significant shift in post-9/11 security protocols, which were broadly implemented after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. While travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt, this policy is now being extended to all flyers at an initial group of airports, with reports of it being observed at others like LAX and LaGuardia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to re-rent units at higher prices. The amendment would require landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, effectively closing a loophole in the city's "just cause" eviction protections. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and can return to their original units.</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the ICU and moved to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after he and his wife were shot multiple times in their home. The attack is believed to be part of a politically motivated spree that also resulted in the death of State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. The alleged shooter is in custody and faces multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder, in a case that has shaken the state's political community.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will visit China, his second trip to the country since his election, signaling a continued improvement in diplomatic relations. The visit comes as Beijing has suggested a review of the decade-old free trade agreement between the two nations. China, Australia's largest trading partner, is looking to expand cooperation in areas such as agriculture, mining, and new technologies like artificial intelligence, further breaking a multi-year freeze in high-level diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) announced it will sever ties with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that Caltech and Simplilearn misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp by implying it had close ties to the prestigious university when the connection was minimal. As part of a settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to former students and Caltech will establish a faculty oversight committee for its other professional education programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating that the country must be able to defend itself from intense Russian attacks. The statement comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The president's decision follows recent phone calls with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he said he made no progress.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its previously announced plan to conduct large-scale layoffs in August. The agency stated that a department-wide reduction-in-force is no longer necessary, as it is on pace to reduce staff by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze. The VA had originally considered cutting over 80,000 jobs to return to pre-2019 staffing levels, a move that had drawn significant criticism from lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to the MLB All-Star team as a "Legend Pick," an honor bestowed by the commissioner to recognize his storied career. Kershaw, who has made a limited number of starts this season after returning from offseason surgery, expressed surprise and gratitude for the selection. This will be his 11th All-Star appearance, a testament to his legacy in the sport rather than his performance in the current season alone.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not initiate legal proceedings against participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. The decision was made due to public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, exempting it from the ban. This development occurs within the context of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government pursuing a broader anti-LGBTQ+ legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order that bars the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. This ruling freezes a key provision of the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which targeted health organizations that provide abortions. The decision marks an early victory for Planned Parenthood in its lawsuit, which argues the law is an unconstitutional measure designed to single out and penalize the organization for its legal healthcare services.</p>

With Ukraine's healthcare system devastated by the war, his visits are often the first medical interaction these women have had in years. His work is vital for early cancer detection, as screening rates have plummeted, and he also provides crucial emotional support to women traumatized by the ongoing conflict.</p>
