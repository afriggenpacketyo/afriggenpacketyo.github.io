          <p>Ben Griffin clinched his first individual PGA Tour victory at the Charles Schwab Challenge, finishing one shot ahead of Matti Schmid after a tense final round at Colonial Country Club. Despite both players struggling with windy conditions, Griffin held on to win, making a crucial par putt on the 72nd hole. Scottie Scheffler, fresh off his PGA Championship win, tied for fourth, failing to capture three consecutive starts. Griffin's victory comes a month after his team win at the Zurich Classic, marking a significant milestone in his career; the final score was one stroke over par at 71, which resulted in a 12-under 268.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla are visiting Canada for a two-day trip that is widely interpreted as a show of support for the country amidst rising tensions with the United States under President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, invited the royal couple and will meet with them in Ottawa. King Charles will deliver the Speech from the Throne to Canada's Parliament, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and rejecting any suggestion of a US takeover. This visit is the King and Queen's first since the start of their reign and symbolizes solidarity with Canada following calls from Trump for the country to become the 51st US state.</p>

The festival also addressed the lack of female headliners, with many praising the depth and breadth of female talent featured throughout the weekend.

The increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection system, which uses auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. The most common types of fake reviews are boosting and member fraud, while paid reviews are a smaller but more pernicious category. Tripadvisor employs AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators, but admits that achieving absolute perfection in rooting out fake reviews remains a challenge.</p>
