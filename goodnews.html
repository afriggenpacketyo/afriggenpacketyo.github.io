          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning itself with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. The action underscores Taiwan's commitment to addressing national security concerns related to arms proliferation activities, and could impact the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, is set to make his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery and has been working towards his return, recently completing his third live batting practice. His return is expedited due to injuries in the Dodgers' bullpen, and he is expected to pitch short innings. Prior to his pitching comeback, Ohtani had a strong performance as a batter, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a win against the San Francisco Giants. The article also mentions the delayed return of rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki due to a shoulder impingement.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, which represents a substantial premium over Santos' previous closing price, has led the company's board to indicate its intention to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. This takeover bid follows unsuccessful attempts in the past, and it would grant the consortium control of key liquefied natural gas operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The acquisition of Santos would give the consortium control of two Australian liquefied natural gas operations ‚Äì Gladstone LNG on the east coast and Darwin LNG in the north of Australia ‚Äì as well as stakes in PNG LNG and the undeveloped Papua LNG.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and consumer goods trade-in programs. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, exceeding analysts' expectations. However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth also fell short of forecasts. The property market continues to contract, with new home prices declining in major cities. Analysts call for stronger policy support to sustain the recovery, as falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>
