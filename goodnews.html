        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has overturned the more than $454 million civil fraud judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company. The original ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron found them liable for a decade of fraud by inflating asset values to secure better business deals, imposing a penalty that grew with interest. Trump's legal team successfully argued on appeal that the case involved a misapplication of the law and other procedural violations, leading to the reversal of the significant financial penalty. This decision marks a major legal victory for the former president in the high-profile case brought by New York's Attorney General.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience using GLP-1 weight loss medications, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, to overcome a weight-loss plateau after having children. In a campaign for the telehealth company Ro, Williams revealed she lost 31 pounds in eight months and aims to destigmatize the use of these drugs, stating it is a form of self-care, not an "easy way out." She joins other public figures like Oprah Winfrey in openly discussing their use of these popular but controversial medications.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal is set to sign Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze after making a late bid that successfully diverted the player from rival club Tottenham Hotspur, which had already agreed to terms. Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who was once in their academy, reportedly made an easy decision to join the Gunners once their interest was formalized, a move prompted by a potential injury to Arsenal's Kai Havertz. The transfer is seen as a major victory by Arsenal supporters, not only for acquiring a talented England international but also for intercepting him from their North London rivals. Eze is expected to provide a new creative dimension to Arsenal's attack.</p>

The deal sets a 15% blanket tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., with specific caps for key sectors like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and automobiles, avoiding previously threatened higher rates. Additionally, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing at least $600 billion in the American economy, aiming to rebalance transatlantic trade. This agreement provides clarity for businesses and marks a significant step in defining the economic relationship between the two powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly released details of the EU-US trade agreement reveal that the European Union will adopt US security standards to prevent advanced technology, particularly AI chips, from reaching China. As part of the deal, the EU will purchase $40 billion worth of AI chips from the US and implement controls to avoid "technology leakage to destinations of concern." This move signals a closer alignment of the EU with Washington's strategy on technology and security, potentially creating further economic friction between Europe and Beijing. EU officials confirmed the bloc's commitment to ensuring these sensitive semiconductors do not end up in the "wrong hands." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that homeowners can strategically use home equity loans to save money, particularly in the current high-interest-rate environment. Two primary beneficial uses are consolidating high-interest debt, such as credit cards, and financing value-adding home improvements, the interest for which may be tax-deductible. With home equity at record highs, these loans offer a lower-cost borrowing alternative to personal loans. However, experts caution against using them for luxury purchases or daily expenses and advise that they are best suited for those with stable income, good credit, and at least 20% equity remaining in their home.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for individual parole hearings this week after more than three decades in prison. Their original sentences of life without parole were reduced in May to 50 years to life, making them eligible for release under California's youthful offender law. The brothers have maintained they acted in self-defense following years of severe parental abuse, a claim bolstered by new evidence that emerged in 2023. Their case has received renewed public attention, and a decision on their potential release is expected shortly after the hearings, with final approval resting with Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

The academy's founder, Mohammad Tajul Islam, has worked to persuade conservative local communities of the value of girls playing sports.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cap tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union at 15%, backing down from earlier threats of rates as high as 250%. This clarification comes as part of the new US-EU trade framework, which applies a 15% tariff to most European goods. In exchange, the EU will eliminate duties on all U.S. industrial goods. However, a higher 27.5% tariff on European cars will remain until the EU formalizes its tariff reductions, a move that requires legislative action. The deal aims to stabilize the transatlantic trade relationship but has disappointed sectors like wine and spirits, which were not exempted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the United Kingdom has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below the 5% threshold since May 2023. This milestone, along with the average two-year fixed rate also falling to 4.97%, signals a trend of steadily declining borrowing costs. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be modest, financial analysts view it as a symbolic turning point that could boost buyer confidence and increase competition among lenders. The drop provides welcome news for hundreds of thousands of homeowners whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has increased its sales and earnings forecast for the full year, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce division and resilient consumer spending. The retail giant reported a nearly 5% rise in second-quarter sales to $177.4 billion, though its earnings per share fell short of analyst expectations due to one-time expenses. Company executives noted that costs from U.S. tariffs are rising and that some of these costs have been passed on to consumers, particularly affecting lower-income households. Despite this, Walmart's focus on value continues to attract shoppers, with comparable sales in the U.S. growing by 4.6%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July from the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. The rise is attributed to a brief dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also saw a significant increase, rising 15.7% from the same time last year to its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal year-over-year increase of 0.2%, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors suggest that age is a critical factor in determining whether an annuity is a suitable retirement investment. Generally, they are not recommended for individuals under 50 due to early withdrawal penalties and the long-term growth potential of other investments. Conversely, for those over 80, the high fees and surrender charges may outweigh the benefits, as there is less time for the guaranteed income to offset the costs. Annuities are most beneficial for those seeking to cover essential living expenses not met by other sources, but may be a poor choice for individuals with major health issues or those who need to maintain liquidity.

          <p>The new film 'Honey Don’t!', co-written by Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, is a pulpy, B-movie style crime caper set in Bakersfield. The movie stars Margaret Qualley as a sharp-tongued private detective, Honey O’Donohue, who is more interested in seducing women than solving the film's central murder mystery. The review praises the performances of Qualley, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Evans, as well as some witty dialogue, but criticizes the shaggy and unfocused plot. Ultimately, the film is described as an affectionate in-joke for its creators, a deliberately messy and sleazy noir that offers style and some laughs but lacks a compelling narrative rhythm.</p>

          <p>An official assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has confirmed that giraffes, long thought to be a single species, actually comprise four distinct species. Researchers analyzed genetic diversity and skull morphology, concluding that the Southern, Reticulated, Northern, and Masai giraffes are separate species. The groups likely evolved independently due to natural barriers like rivers and mountains that prevented interbreeding. This updated classification is considered vital for conservation efforts, as it allows for more precise assessments of each species' population status and the implementation of targeted strategies to protect them.</p>
