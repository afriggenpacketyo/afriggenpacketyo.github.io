          <p>A labrador-sized dinosaur, originally misclassified, has been identified as a new species named Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago and will be the first new dinosaur to go on display at the Natural History Museum in London since 2014. Scientists determined it was a new species by examining the leg bones and comparing it to the original Nanosaurus specimen. The discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic period and how small dinosaurs evolved into larger ones.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the debate surrounding lab-grown meat, also known as cultivated meat, and whether it should be served in restaurants. Proponents argue it's a technological fix for reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by meat production, while critics suggest reducing meat consumption is a better approach. Concerns are also raised about the ultra-processed nature of lab-grown meat and its potential control by multinational companies. Singapore, the US, and Israel have already approved the sale of lab-grown meat, but mass production and affordability remain challenges.</p>
