        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republic of Ireland has committed to new legislation ensuring full cooperation with a reformed UK legacy body, designed to address cases related to the Northern Ireland Troubles. This "new framework," agreed upon by both governments, includes establishing a dedicated legacy unit within An Garda Síochána, the Irish police force, and a €25m support fund for victims. The initiative seeks to heal a significant diplomatic rift created by the controversial 2023 Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act, which faced widespread opposition. Both London and Dublin view this agreement as an "imperfect opportunity" to move forward, reflecting the unfulfilled spirit of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement and aiming to bring positive change for affected families.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate steady at 0.5%, a decision that aligns with economists' forecasts, as Japan's core inflation rate experienced a third consecutive monthly decline to 2.7% in August, its lowest since November 2024. This cautious stance by the BOJ prioritizes stability over premature tightening, given the easing inflation and global economic uncertainties. While some calls persist for rate hikes due to inflation remaining above the 2% target for over three years, others argue that current high headline inflation figures are largely influenced by supply constraints and external factors like a weak yen. The BOJ's strategy supports a reflationary cycle unique to Japan's macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a narrow 2-1 victory against the San Francisco Giants, extending their National League West division lead to three games. Despite pitching 5⅓ scoreless innings, starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled with command, issuing a career-high six walks, forcing the bullpen into early action. The Dodgers' relief corps, which has recently faced inconsistencies, managed to overcome shaky moments, particularly in the seventh inning, to preserve the precarious lead. Key offensive plays, including a Shohei Ohtani double and Freddie Freeman's RBI single, provided the crucial runs needed for the win, highlighting the team's ability to grind out results.</p>

While some Asian banks have already initiated easing, varying domestic economic conditions will lead to diverse policy responses across the region.
