          <p>Palantir has seen its valuation surge past $430 billion, driven by its AI-powered software and significant government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military. The company recently reported its first quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, with U.S. government revenue growing 53% and now accounting for 55% of the total. Despite a decline in international commercial revenue, strong retail investor interest and major defense contracts have propelled the stock to new highs. The article notes that investors are paying a significant premium, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of most tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old Glasgow student, Rebecca Young, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its 'girls of the year' for her invention of a solar-powered warming blanket for homeless individuals. She developed the concept at a school engineering club, which was then transformed into a working prototype by the firm Thales and distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also immortalized as a mini-figure.

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point's class of 2025 has honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting. Wang, who was posthumously accepted into the class, died while holding a door open for other students to escape the gunman. Following an inquiry from CBS News, his classmates nominated him for the Honorary Graduate Award, recognizing his embodiment of West Point's values of duty, honor, and country. The act ensures that Wang's story of selfless sacrifice will be remembered by the newly commissioned Army officers.</p>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry is at a crossroads, with leading companies Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods adopting different strategies to attract consumers. Beyond is pivoting towards simpler, 'cleaner' ingredients and even dropping 'meat' from its name, aiming to appeal to health-conscious consumers wary of processed foods. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking the taste and experience of conventional meat, launching more 'indulgent' products and embracing a meatier brand identity. The article suggests the future of the industry may depend on which of these opposing bets on consumer preferences proves more successful.</p>

          <p>King Charles will deliver a personal message to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, honoring the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Pacific and Far East. In an audio recording, the King will vow that these individuals will "never be forgotten," echoing a broadcast made by his grandfather, King George VI, in 1945. He and the Queen will attend a remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum, which will include a national two-minute silence and a flypast by the RAF Red Arrows, to commemorate the end of World War Two.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, the defending champion London Spirit suffered their first loss of the season, defeated by the Trent Rockets by 33 runs. The Rockets set a target of 150, largely thanks to an unbeaten 51 from England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. In response, the Spirit were bowled out for 116, with Rockets' spinner Kirstie Gordon taking an impressive four wickets for 19 runs. The victory marks the first win of the year for the Trent Rockets, leaving Welsh Fire as the only remaining winless team in the women's tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following criticism from residents and a funeral director, who labeled it a 'fat tax'. The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6ft wide plot compared to a standard 5ft one at Danescourt cemetery. The council had initially defended the proposal by citing increased demand due to rising obesity rates, a practice already in place in other local authorities. However, after a BBC investigation highlighted public opposition, the council announced it would not proceed with the plans.</p>

          <p>Louis Naidorf, the architect renowned for designing the iconic, circular Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 96. While the 1956 tower was his most famous work, his extensive portfolio also includes the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the Beverly Hilton hotel, and Arizona's tallest building, the Chase Tower. Naidorf, who began his career at 24, was celebrated for his creative and humane approach to design and later became a dedicated educator at Woodbury University. He often humorously refuted the myth that his most famous building was designed to look like a stack of records.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has confirmed the insurer's dedication to its net zero climate goals, even as political resistance to such ambitions grows in the U.S. and U.K. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the insurance business, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires. The statement comes as Aviva's shares reached their highest point since the 2008 financial crisis following a 22% jump in operating profit. The company's stance contrasts with several major U.S. and U.K. banks that have recently withdrawn from climate alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declining rates, providing some relief to prospective homebuyers who have been sidelined by high borrowing costs. The decrease is linked to a fall in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut its key interest rate. While the lower rates have spurred an increase in mortgage applications, particularly for refinancing, economists still expect rates to remain above 6% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial race, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is reaching out to Latino voters with her first Spanish-language radio ad, focusing on the economy and rising costs. The move is part of a broader Democratic effort to regain support from the Latino community, which saw a shift toward Republicans in the 2024 election. Spanberger's ad promises to lower costs and criticizes her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump-era policies. The ad highlights the strategic importance of the growing Latino electorate in Virginia, where the economy remains a top issue for voters.</p>
