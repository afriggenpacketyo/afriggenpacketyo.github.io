        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first day of NBA free agency saw significant shifts, with center Myles Turner agreeing to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture and will likely miss most of the upcoming season. Other major deals included Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting $285 million extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Duncan Robinson signing with the Detroit Pistons. These moves signal major roster realignments for several key teams ahead of the new season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of a major US policy bill passed by the Senate proposes to increase tax credits for domestic semiconductor manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand advanced chip production within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS Act. The legislation, which still needs House approval, is part of a broader effort to onshore critical supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia. Analysts suggest the combination of increased tax credits and potential tariffs creates a strong financial motivation for chipmakers to accelerate their US-based projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is strategically increasing its investments in African copper mining, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana, to secure supplies for its green energy transition. As Western nations, like Canada, restrict Chinese access to critical minerals, Africa has become an essential source for copper, which is vital for electric vehicles and solar power systems. Chinese firms are making significant investments, such as JCHX Mining's plan to invest $800 million in a Zambian mine. This move highlights copper's growing importance and the geopolitical competition over essential resources for future technologies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling prevents the immediate deportation threat for thousands who have established lives in the U.S., though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>
