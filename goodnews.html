          <p>Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to expectant mothers in the Baltimore area through its long-running Birth Companions program. Nursing students are trained to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor and birth, acting as advocates for patients. The initiative aims to create a more supportive birth experience for mothers in the community. Its impact is amplified by a new Maryland law that requires all hospitals to facilitate the presence of certified doulas during childbirth, making these services more accessible.</p>

          <p>In a new regulatory filing, ticket marketplace StubHub announced its goal to raise as much as $851 million in its upcoming initial public offering, targeting a valuation of up to $9.2 billion. The company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price between $22 and $25 each, trading under the ticker symbol "STUB." This long-awaited IPO follows previous postponements due to market volatility. The filing showed a 10% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter, though the company's net loss also widened during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The father and son involved in a widely circulated confrontation at a Philadelphia Phillies game are speaking out about the incident. Andrew Feltwell gave a home run ball to his son, Lincoln, for his birthday, but was then aggressively confronted by a woman who claimed he took the ball from her. Although Feltwell ultimately gave her the ball to de-escalate the situation, both the Phillies and the visiting Miami Marlins provided the young fan with gifts. The Marlins gave him a bag of goodies, and the player who hit the home run gave him a signed baseball bat.</p>

The two ticket holders will split the massive prize, with each facing a choice between a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million before taxes. However, their final take-home amounts will differ significantly due to state tax laws. The Texas winner will pay no state income tax on their winnings, while the Missouri winner will face a state tax withholding of at least 4%, potentially costing them millions.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Securing a Lower Mortgage Rate as 30-Year Fixed Average Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 13:27:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts are offering advice on how homebuyers can secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's FICO score by consistently paying bills on time and keeping credit utilization low. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can lead to a lower interest rate from lenders. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider loan options beyond the traditional 30-year fixed mortgage, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing scrutiny over their bullpen's performance, which has been a key factor in a recent series of late-game losses. High-priced offseason acquisitions like closer Tanner Scott have struggled significantly, contributing to a team ERA that ranks in the bottom half of the league. Despite these issues and a rash of injuries, manager Dave Roberts and the coaching staff have publicly stated they will continue to trust their established relievers. The team is banking on these veteran players to regain their form before the upcoming playoffs.</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high, exceeding $3,600 per ounce, as investors continue to seek safe-haven assets amid global uncertainty. The precious metal has seen its value increase by over 38% since the beginning of the year. Analysts from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are forecasting that the price could climb even higher, potentially reaching $4,000 by mid-2026. This bullish outlook is supported by recent weak labor market data and the possibility of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued an apology after the finisher medals and T-shirts mistakenly featured an aerial view of the wrong city. Instead of Newcastle and the River Tyne, where the race is famously held, the items depicted the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company said, "Wear [sic] sorry!" and acknowledged the error was missed by many. They framed the flawed items as unique collector's pieces from the event's history.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour Party begins the contest to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader, former deputy Harriet Harman has weighed in on the desired qualifications for the role. Baroness Harman argued that the party must select a woman from outside of London to complement leader Keir Starmer and broaden the party's appeal across the country. The party has established an accelerated timeline for the election, with nominations opening this week and a winner to be announced in late October. The race is expected to shape the future direction of the party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against former President Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The panel of three judges unanimously rejected Trump's claims that he was protected by presidential immunity and that the damages awarded were excessive. The court's opinion stated that the jury's award was "fair and reasonable" considering the "extraordinary and egregious facts of this case." This ruling marks another significant legal defeat for Trump in the long-running legal battle initiated by Carroll's allegations of sexual assault.</p>
