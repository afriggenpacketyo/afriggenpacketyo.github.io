          <p>Argentina's Supreme Court has discovered dozens of boxes filled with Nazi materials dating back to World War II within its basement archives. The collection includes postcards, photographs, notebooks, and propaganda, which were found during preparations for a museum. The court has invited Argentina's Holocaust Museum to help document and preserve the items and to investigate international financing networks used by the Nazis. The artifacts were originally sent from the German embassy in Japan to Argentina in 1941 but were confiscated due to concerns about Argentina's neutrality during the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying what Medicare pays for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to ensure the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest cost, a plan he unsuccessfully tried to implement during his first term. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices will hurt profits and innovation. The order is likely to impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, such as infusions and injectables.</p>

          <p>Investors showed optimism after American officials touted progress in trade negotiations, although specific details had yet to be released. Stocks in Asia experienced gains on Monday following weekend talks that signaled progress in easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The meetings were the first between Washington and Beijing since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory taxes from China. Analysts anticipate that an initial agreement will involve a much lower level for tariffs, potentially reducing the risk of an economic downturn.</p>

Many supermarket products advertising protein content may be gimmicky and not as healthy as advertised, with some containing as many calories as regular products.

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple, ending a dispute that had contributed to bilateral friction. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, a Nagasaki Prefecture island, was handed over in South Korea to people representing the Japanese temple on Saturday. The artifact is designated as a cultural asset by the prefecture.</p>
