          <p>Jen Pawol made sports history by becoming the first female umpire to officiate a Major League Baseball regular-season game, working at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was met with a warm reception from fans and players, and she made her first significant call in the third inning. Following the historic game, Pawol donated the cap she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone. The 48-year-old's promotion comes after years of umpiring in the minor leagues, marking a significant moment for baseball.</p>

          <p>The booming market for functional beverages, which promise benefits like relaxation and stress relief, is facing scrutiny from health experts. Nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine in these drinks can produce their advertised effects. Recently, an ad by the popular brand Trip was banned for making unproven health claims about managing stress and anxiety. While some consumers find the drinks to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more of a placebo, created by the ritual of taking a mindful break.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in Paris's Left Bank, selling papers like Le Monde by shouting headlines. Once part of a thriving community of dozens of hawkers, he is now the sole practitioner of his trade, a decline he attributes to the rise of digital news. Despite dwindling sales, Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings, having become an iconic part of the Saint-Germain neighborhood.</p>

The competition, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of dogs regardless of pedigree and awarded Petunia's owner a $5,000 prize. Many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills, and the event serves to promote adoption by showcasing these distinctive pets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran recently faced social media debate after describing himself as "culturally Irish," despite being born and raised in England. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection, stating that Ireland shaped his musical tastes during childhood holidays. The controversy highlights the complex and evolving nature of cultural identity, particularly for the second-generation Irish in Britain. Experts and cultural figures note that in the post-Good Friday Agreement era, identity is less about rigid binaries and more about personal connection, heritage, and a blend of influences, a sentiment reflected across modern Irish arts and culture.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes before a single positive review slightly raised it. However, the overwhelmingly negative reception has ironically generated interest, with many viewers drawn to watch what has been called "one of the worst movies ever made." This phenomenon reflects a broader appreciation for "junk film," where movies are so earnestly bad they become entertaining cult classics. Experts suggest that such films are more memorable and interesting than bland, forgettable blockbusters, offering a unique charm through their visible flaws and ambitious failures.</p>

          <h2>China's DeepSeek AI App Continues to Influence Tech Industry Despite Fading Hype</h2>

          <p>Six months after its launch shocked Silicon Valley, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to impact the technology landscape, even after its initial media buzz has subsided. The app challenged the prevailing "bigger is better" philosophy by demonstrating that a highly capable AI model could be developed for a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. While security concerns about data sharing with China persist, some U.S. startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs. The app's success has also fueled the U.S.-China AI rivalry and prompted American companies like OpenAI to release smaller, more efficient open-source models.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. President Trump responded favorably, stating that Apple's domestic investments would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about profitability. This successful meeting compounded positive momentum from Apple's recent earnings report, which showed strong revenue and iPhone sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig on a positive note, securing a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Olga Danilovic in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. Despite a slow start, Raducanu demonstrated her increasing match toughness and reliability against lower-ranked opponents, patiently defending and capitalizing on her opponent's errors in the sweltering heat. She noted that Roig is already helping her improve the quality of her shots and that she trusts the work they are doing. A more significant challenge awaits in the third round, where she will face either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, delivered a powerful performance in their final warm-up match before the World Cup, defeating France 40-6. The English team's forward pack dominated the game, particularly in the maul, which led to three first-half tries and two late scores from Lark Atkin-Davies. The victory extends England's winning streak against France to 16 consecutive matches and serves as a major statement of intent ahead of the tournament. While not a flawless performance, the comprehensive win solidifies England's position as the world's number one team and favorites for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's spectacular unbeaten 86 from 50 balls was not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire against London Spirit. Despite Bairstow's late onslaught, which included back-to-back sixes, Fire fell short by eight runs in their chase of 164. The team's chances were hampered by an early top-order collapse that left them at 55-6, starving Bairstow of the strike for much of the innings. London Spirit's total was anchored by David Warner's unbeaten 70, helping them bounce back from a previous poor performance and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless.</p>
