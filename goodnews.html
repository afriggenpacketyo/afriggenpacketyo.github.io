          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss pill, orforglipron, showed significant success in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The daily pill, a GLP-1 medication similar to its injectable drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro, helped adults with obesity achieve substantial weight loss. While side effects like nausea and diarrhea were reported, the company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year. If approved, the pill could offer a more accessible and convenient alternative to current injectable treatments, potentially becoming available to consumers by 2026.</p>

          <p>Gina Carano and The Walt Disney Company have settled a lawsuit filed by the actress over her 2021 firing from the series "The Mandalorian." Carano had alleged wrongful termination and discrimination based on her controversial social media posts, while Lucasfilm had called her posts "abhorrent and unacceptable." The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but both parties released statements indicating a resolution. A Lucasfilm spokesperson even suggested a potential for future collaboration, signaling an end to the contentious legal dispute between the former star and the studio.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new restrictions on serious sexual and violent criminals upon their release from prison. Instead of merely excluding offenders from certain areas, the new plan would confine them to a specific, tailored geographical zone, which would be monitored through enhanced electronic tagging. The Ministry of Justice states this will provide victims greater peace of mind, allowing them to live without fear of encountering their attacker. However, probation officers have raised concerns about the increased workload and pressure on an already strained service.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed second-quarter financial results, with revenues beating expectations but earnings per share falling short due to high beef prices. The company reported strong comparable sales growth of 5.8%, driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic, a positive sign for the brand's popularity. Management noted that these strong traffic trends have continued into the third quarter. However, persistent beef inflation remains a significant headwind, creating a challenging operating environment despite the restaurant's strong consumer appeal and value proposition.

          <p>Holidaymakers in the United Kingdom are increasingly booking shorter vacations, closer to home, and with less advance notice, according to major travel companies. Firms like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Pitchup.com report a significant rise in last-minute domestic travel bookings, a trend attributed to budget-consciousness and the desire to take advantage of favorable weather. Holiday parks and campsites are seeing a surge in spontaneous getaways as families opt for more affordable and convenient UK-based breaks over international travel. This shift reflects changing consumer behavior in response to economic pressures.</p>

          <p>A pop-up health clinic operating on the quayside in Brixham, Devon, is being highlighted as a successful model for preventative, community-focused healthcare. The "Seafit" clinic brings GPs, nurses, and other specialists directly to fishermen, a community that often struggles to access traditional NHS services due to their demanding work schedules. By providing on-the-spot health screenings and treatment, the initiative has successfully identified serious conditions like cancer and sepsis early. This approach aligns with the NHS's long-term plan to shift focus from hospital-based treatment to localized, preventative care.</p>

          <p>A sharp plunge in Fortinet's stock, following its earnings report, has dragged down the entire cybersecurity sector, but some analysts believe the reaction is overblown for other companies. Fortinet's stock fell 25% after comments that its firewall refresh cycle was further along than expected, leading to downgrades. However, this has created what some see as an unwarranted dip in peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, which have different business models. This article suggests the sell-off presents a potential buying opportunity for investors who believe these other cybersecurity firms remain fundamentally strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fintech company Block saw its shares jump in after-hours trading after it raised its full-year guidance, despite reporting mixed results for the second quarter. While the company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share missed analyst expectations, its gross profit grew 14% to $2.54 billion, beating estimates. Block increased its full-year gross profit forecast to $10.17 billion and its adjusted operating income to $2.03 billion. The positive outlook suggests confidence in its core businesses, including Square and Cash App, even as it faces growing competition. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the loss, Williams expressed satisfaction with her performance, stating she felt good about how she competed and that she simply needs more match play. She is expected to compete next in the U.S. Open, where she will likely receive a wildcard entry.</p>
