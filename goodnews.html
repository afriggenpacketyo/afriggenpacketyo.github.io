          <p>Barington Capital, an activist investor with a history of improving shareholder value, is advocating for significant changes at Victoria's Secret & Co., including board reconstitution and a review of CEO Hillary Super's role. The firm aims to refocus on the core brand, accelerate digital and international growth, and streamline operations. Barington's past engagement with L Brands, Victoria's Secret's former parent company, resulted in a substantial stock price increase, suggesting a constructive approach. With extensive experience in the retail sector and a preference for collaborative engagement, Barington is likely to work amicably with the board to drive positive change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with a history of heart troubles and an LVAD implant, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic to combat dangerous heart rhythms and antibody production. Doctors transplanted a liver alongside the new heart to lower the risk of organ rejection, which proved successful. Sadly, Baker's husband passed away shortly after her recovery, leaving her with significant medical bills and unstable housing. Despite these challenges, Baker hopes her participation in the groundbreaking surgery will pave the way for more patients to receive life-saving treatments.</p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel *Audition* uses space colonization to explore themes of exploitation, identity, and human connection. The story follows three giants confined to a spaceship, their language and actions controlled by a system that prevents them from realizing their true potential. By passing through the event horizon of a black hole, the giants realize their shared past, reconfiguring their dialogue and relationships as an interstellar jail. The author uses outer space to imagine alternative forms of human relation, beyond the gravitational trap of Earth's prejudices and hierarchies, its forms of ownership and exploitation.</p>

The company is embedding AI across its operations, but faces challenges in building fundamental models, prompting Zuckerberg to aggressively recruit top talent.

They may also revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership amid China's increasing maritime prowess.
