          <p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs, suspecting them of violating antitrust laws through coordinated boycotts among advertisers. The investigation focuses on whether these groups colluded to pressure advertisers, potentially stifling competition and harming the advertising market. This scrutiny highlights the increasing regulatory oversight of advertising practices and the potential consequences for organizations involved in boycott activities. The outcome of the investigation could set a precedent for future antitrust enforcement in the advertising industry.</p>

          <p>Eaglet Sunny, from the Big Bear family of eagles, has taken her first flight from the nest, delighting fans who monitor the live webcam. Her sibling, Gizmo, watched as Sunny fledged, marking a bittersweet moment for observers. While Sunny may not return to the nest as frequently, her parents, Jackie and Shadow, will continue to protect her and help her find food for several weeks or months. This milestone is a significant step in Sunny's development, although the first year of life can be challenging for eagles.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned two south Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman‚Äôs longline. The divers believed the line was illegal and reported it to state officials, but federal prosecutors charged them with theft because the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase their felony convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely. Attorneys for the divers expressed relief and stated that the case should never have been filed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides relief for older borrowers who rely on fixed incomes, as the government can seize up to 15% of their Social Security checks to repay defaulted loans. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default, and advocates have expressed concern about the potential impact on their financial stability. The pause allows borrowers more time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks in the future (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering a massive budget package containing President Trump's agenda, which faces a narrow path to passage due to opposition from several GOP senators. Key sticking points include proposed changes to Medicaid, deeper spending cuts, and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Some senators are concerned about the impact of Medicaid cuts on low-income Americans and rural hospitals, while others are pushing for more significant reductions in spending. The debate also includes provisions related to state and local tax deductions, the debt ceiling, and food stamps.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart, the company behind the popular collectible character Labubu, to Sanrio and its Hello Kitty franchise, suggesting it could be a new model for cultural exports. Labubu's popularity, driven by high-profile fans and successful product launches, has boosted Pop Mart's stock. Some experts believe Labubu's success is due to its universal appeal rather than its Chinese origin, potentially paving the way for other Chinese brands to succeed internationally. JPMorgan Chase has initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, indicating strong confidence in the company's future.</p>

The study revealed that babies who are frequently sung to are generally happier throughout the day. NPR is encouraging parents to share the songs they sing to calm or bring joy to their babies, and even upload recordings. These submissions may be featured on Morning Edition in the near future.</p>

          <p>The northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. due to recent solar storms, with a coronal mass ejection prompting a severe solar storm alert. The lights could be seen in states including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and Michigan. The sun's current active phase, part of its 11-year cycle, makes these displays more common. To view the auroras, it's recommended to find a dark, quiet area away from city lights and check the weather forecast for cloud cover.</p>
