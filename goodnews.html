          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings and announced it had secured a $10 billion order for custom AI chips from a new, undisclosed customer. The chipmaker exceeded revenue expectations and provided a robust forecast for the upcoming quarter, driven by significant growth in its AI-related sales. CEO Hock Tan revealed the large order for its custom AI accelerators, referred to as XPUs, has boosted the company's AI revenue forecast for the next year. This development positions Broadcom as a growing competitor in the high-demand AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is evaluating a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The proposal mirrors a law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the public health risks of extreme heat, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations like the elderly and chronically ill. Proponents argue that cooling should be treated as a utility necessity similar to heating, while landlord associations express concern over potential implementation costs and their subsequent impact on rent prices.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has adopted a more focused public role during her husband's second term, concentrating on the intersection of technology and child welfare. In a rare public appearance at a White House AI education task force meeting, she emphasized the need to prepare children for an AI-driven future with "watchful guidance." Her efforts build upon her first-term "Be Best" initiative and have included championing the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Analysts observe her approach is less about traditional maternal advocacy and more focused on the business and legislative aspects of protecting children online.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at a record high and interest rates relatively low, homeowners are presented with an opportunity to borrow against their property's value. However, this article advises caution, urging potential borrowers to ask critical questions before proceeding, especially with a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated. Homeowners should assess how much equity they can realistically access, whether their financial needs are urgent enough to justify borrowing at current rates, and if they might miss out on better rates in the near future. The article also suggests comparing the fixed rates of a home equity loan against the potential volatility of a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland defeated Luxembourg 3-1 in a World Cup qualifying match, a result manager Michael O'Neill attributed to a stern half-time talk. After taking an early lead through a Jamie Reid goal, Northern Ireland conceded an equalizer before the break, prompting a critical response from the manager. The team responded immediately in the second half, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds after the restart. Justin Devenny later added a third goal to secure the win, which was aided by a red card for Luxembourg's Seid Korac.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut expected in September, this article offers strategic advice for individuals considering opening a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account. It recommends that savers act quickly, as banks may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision, potentially closing the current window for high returns. The advice includes evaluating whether to deposit more or less than $10,000, shopping directly with online banks which typically offer higher rates, and not waiting until the official Fed announcement to lock in a favorable rate. The goal is to maximize interest earnings before the rate environment shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has stepped down from his role as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. His tenure was marked by significant off-field achievements, including the development of a new £1 billion stadium and a state-of-the-art training facility. However, Levy was a frequent target of fan protests due to a perceived lack of on-field success, with the club winning only two major trophies during his time in charge. The club's ownership reportedly decided a change in leadership was needed to pursue greater sporting success, with Peter Charrington taking on a new role as non-executive chairman.</p>

This marks the company's first airport testing site in California, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. The service will allow passengers to be picked up from airport terminals and transported to destinations within Waymo's San Francisco Bay service area. This expansion follows the successful launch of a similar service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become a popular destination for Waymo riders, as the company continues to scale its operations across the U.S.</p>

          <p>After a long period of being used primarily for surveillance due to vulnerability to Russian air defenses, Ukraine's Bayraktar TB-2 drones are once again conducting successful strike missions. Recent attacks, including one on a Russian boat in the Black Sea, indicate a resurgence of the drone's offensive capabilities. Analysts suggest this is possible because Ukrainian forces have systematically degraded Russian air defense and radar systems in the region, particularly in Crimea and Kherson. This has created safer corridors for the drones to operate, allowing Ukraine to adapt its tactics and leverage the Bayraktar's ability to strike moving targets of opportunity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2025, offering some relief to potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since January, representing significant potential savings over the life of a loan. This decline is attributed to shifts in the broader economy and anticipation of Federal Reserve policy changes. While rates are not as low as their record lows from a few years ago, the current trajectory is encouraging, with the possibility of further decreases if the Fed continues to issue rate cuts.

The announcement was made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a visit to Quito, where he pledged security assistance and drone technology to support Ecuador's fight against organized crime. This designation allows Washington to freeze the gangs' assets, target their associates, and share intelligence for operations against them. The move comes as Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa's government struggles to contain a surge in cartel-related violence, which has driven a significant portion of the world's cocaine trade through the country.</p>
