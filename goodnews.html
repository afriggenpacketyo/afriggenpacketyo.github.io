          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration, collaborating with financial regulators, has shut down numerous social media accounts for spreading false financial information and illegally touting stocks. The crackdown addresses growing concerns about financial influencers who use sensationalist headlines and questionable claims to attract investors. Authorities aim to protect investors from misleading information and market disruption, urging the public to invest wisely and avoid rumors. China had over 220 million individual investors at the end of last year, making it a large market susceptible to such scams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is considering amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to relax regulations on heating systems and prioritize energy security alongside climate protection. Reiche plans to construct new gas-fired power plants and potentially abolish the operating ban on older gas boilers. While the previous government focused on promoting heat pumps, the new administration seeks a more balanced approach. Critics argue that Reiche's plans could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies, while supporters emphasize the need for energy security and diverse solutions.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has secured a court order to prevent waste vehicles from being blocked from leaving depots, as a bin strike continues and over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste accumulates. The council believes industrial action by pickets has disrupted collections, leading to the need for legal intervention. Unite, representing the workers, has previously stated their actions are legitimate, but the council insists clearing waste is a public health duty. The strike is focused on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with negotiations ongoing.</p>

          <p>Design legend Adrian Newey, who joined Aston Martin in March, believes the team's quest to become competitive will be hampered by "weak tools." Newey specifically pointed to the team's new simulator as a weak spot, stating it needs significant work as it is not correlating well. He estimates that improving the simulator will be a two-year project. Aston Martin is currently seventh in the constructors' championship.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarisation. International businesses are actively looking to diversify from the US dollar, with interest in using the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools. The increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments should benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially amid strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar. This trend aligns with China's effort to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling.</p>
