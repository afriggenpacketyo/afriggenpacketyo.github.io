          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born businessman and founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, has passed away peacefully at the age of 84. He built Kwik Fit into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain, eventually selling it to Ford for ¬£1 billion in 1999. Beyond his business achievements, Sir Tom was also known for his involvement in sports, owning a majority stake in Hibernian FC for over two decades, reflecting his diverse interests and contributions to both the business and sporting communities. His legacy as a successful entrepreneur and supporter of Scottish football will be remembered.</p>

          <h2>Bill Introduced to Ease Cannabis Research Restrictions in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 07:00:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar have introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. This bill aims to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that currently forbid federal funds from being used for research on Schedule I substances. Proponents argue that this would allow research to catch up with increasing cannabis consumption and enable policymakers to craft more effective and informed legislation. While the Biden administration previously pushed for cannabis rescheduling, the EBDPA offers a potentially simpler path forward by prioritizing evidence over ideology, though its passage remains uncertain due to partisan divisions.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and crashed into the Indian Ocean. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded in Earth's orbit, and its return serves as a reminder of the ambitious space race during the Cold War. While the US focused on the moon, the Soviet Union aimed for Venus, achieving several milestones with its Venera program, including the first probes to enter another planet‚Äôs atmosphere and land on its surface, but the article notes that other proposed missions have faced delays and uncertain futures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer known for her focus on metabolic health and skepticism toward conventional medical practices, as the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, who aligns with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement, aims to reverse the chronic disease epidemic and promote better health for all Americans. Her background includes a medical degree from Stanford, a residency in otolaryngology, and co-founding Levels, an app for tracking food and biometric data. Her views, which include skepticism about childhood vaccines and the removal of ultra-processed foods from school lunches, mirror those of Kennedy, sparking both support and controversy.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging "The Central Park Five," an opera that recounts the story of five Black and brown teenagers wrongly convicted of assaulting a woman in Central Park in 1989. The opera also includes the role of Donald Trump, who at the time took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the accused. The production aims to focus on the experiences of the Five and their journey through trauma, rather than emphasizing Trump's character, as the director Nataki Garrett dismissed suggestions of toning down the staging, stating that the central story is about these boys and their subsequent lives.</p>

          <p>In California's agricultural heartland, farmers are investing in housing for guest workers under the H-2A visa program due to labor shortages and stricter immigration enforcement. These modern housing complexes offer amenities and have gained support from county leaders, though some community members raise concerns about the lack of affordable housing for domestic farmworkers. With the Trump administration's immigration policies, growers are seeking legal avenues to stabilize their workforce, even as farmworker advocates voice concerns about potential exploitation within the H-2A program, though the construction of the modern complexes helps to improve the living conditions for the laborers.</p>
