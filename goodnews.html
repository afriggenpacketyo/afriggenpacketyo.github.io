          <p>President Donald Trump announced productive phone talks with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, indicating progress on a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, though Beijing's confirmation was less definitive. The proposed deal reportedly involves U.S. investors acquiring TikTok's U.S. business, utilizing ByteDance's algorithm under license. Trump has repeatedly delayed the app's ban, now extended to December, and views TikTok as crucial for his 2024 campaign. Concerns persist among U.S. lawmakers regarding potential Chinese Communist Party influence through the algorithm, even as both leaders agreed to future in-person meetings on trade and other thorny issues.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. Its current track anticipates it will remain over open waters, north of the Caribbean, though it could pass east of Bermuda next week. While no immediate land hazards are warned, Bermuda may experience some impacts. This storm develops during what is historically the peak hurricane season, though overall activity has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, which had forecast a busier-than-average year.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, has become a crucial hub for Chinese exporters redirecting their focus towards Southeast Asian markets. Faced with slowing demand in Western countries and seeking new growth opportunities, many companies see the region's fast-growing economies and young consumer base as highly promising. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend among Chinese firms to diversify their overseas footprints. Managers like Li Wenqi, whose electric scooter company traditionally relied on European and American markets, highlight Southeast Asia's "huge potential" in a world with limited saturated markets.</p>

          <p>Martin Jennings, chosen to sculpt the statue for Queen Elizabeth II's national memorial in St James's Park, aims to capture her "grandeur and dignity." The sculptor, known for portraying King Charles III, expressed elation at the commission and plans to involve the Royal Family in the final design. The memorial, with a budget between £23m and £46m, will also include a bridge, a statue of the Queen and Prince Philip, and new gardens. While an anti-monarchy group calls for the Royal Family to fund it, the project signifies a significant national tribute to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google, are making substantial investments in the UK's artificial intelligence sector, signaling a "tech bromance" with potential to boost the UK economy. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK an "AI superpower," while Microsoft announced a £22bn investment and Google committed £5bn. This influx of capital is seen as a vote of confidence, driven by the UK's scientific talent and a "pro-growth" regulatory environment. While raising optimism, some critics warn of dependence on U.S. giants and potential job displacement from AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, 49, stated he is nothing like his "psychopathic gangster" character Tommy Shelby from "Peaky Blinders," a role he cherishes as a "gift and a privilege" for a quarter of his life. As a "Peaky Blinders" film is set for Netflix release, Murphy remains tight-lipped about the plot. He is also promoting his new film, "Steve," where he plays a headteacher at a reform school. Murphy reflected on the unexpected global adoration and longevity of "Peaky Blinders," crediting its writing and timing, while emphasizing his ability to explore diverse roles between projects.</p>
