          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully conducted the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, was used on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein, reportedly reducing risks and recovery time while successfully helping the patient regain some limb movement. This advancement represents a significant alternative approach in the field of neurotechnology.</p>

          <p>Despite a performance their manager described as not their best, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. The game featured a mixed showing, with starter Dustin May lasting only four innings and the team managing just four hits. However, key offensive contributions, including home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, and a scoreless effort from the bullpen secured the win.

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated that the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan is for him to remain with the team. Sources close to the player have refuted suggestions of his frustration at the club, noting he signed a new five-year contract last year. A loan would only be considered if all parties agree it is best for his development.</p>

          <p>A study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found that working-age people who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet have a lower rate of depressive symptoms. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between this diet and improved mental health. The institute noted that certain foods in the diet, like oily fish and seaweed, contain nutrients known to support neurotransmitter function and reduce inflammation.</p>

Massey was located at a New Orleans residence and taken into custody peacefully. The manhunt continues for the final fugitive, Derrick Groves, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.

          <p>Scientists are reviving a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy, which uses viruses that prey on bacteria to treat infections. With antibiotic resistance becoming a growing global health crisis, researchers are hunting for these bacteriophages, or "phages," in places like dirty water and sewage. The process involves finding a precise phage match for a specific harmful bacteria. A recent project at the University of Southampton successfully isolated a phage from a toilet sample that killed bacteria from a patient's recurring urinary tract infection, highlighting the potential of this alternative treatment.</p>

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order was "unconstitutional from beginning to end," following similar rulings against orders targeting firms like Perkins Coie and WilmerHale. The orders sought to impose punitive measures, such as suspending security clearances, for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. The ruling was hailed by the firm as a "resounding victory for the rule of law."</p>
