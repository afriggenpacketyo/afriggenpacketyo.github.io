          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri narrowly claimed pole position for the Dutch Grand Prix, edging out his teammate Lando Norris by just 0.012 seconds in a tense qualifying session at Zandvoort. Both drivers set their fastest times on their initial laps in the final session and were unable to improve on their second attempts. Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified third, while rookie Isack Hadjar delivered an impressive performance to secure fourth place for Racing Bulls. The result intensifies the close championship battle between the two McLaren teammates, with Piastri extending his lead.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1 billion for the first time in over a year, following 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. This ranks as the sixth-largest jackpot in the game's history, with players facing odds of 1 in 292.2 million to match all six numbers. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the advertised amount. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with additional taxes likely due, and most states also levy their own income taxes on the prize.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, after severe drought caused water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir to drop to historic lows. The tombs, dating to the Hellenistic period, were unearthed in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the ongoing drought has had a devastating impact on Iraq's agriculture and resources, it has inadvertently created opportunities for archaeological excavation. The team is working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again when water levels rise.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly rejected a proposal from Crystal Palace to include defender Joe Gomez in a loan deal as part of negotiations for Palace captain Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace is exploring options for Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract and could leave on a free transfer next summer. While Palace would consider a deal involving a cash payment plus Gomez on loan, Liverpool has no intention of letting their player leave on a temporary basis. The situation complicates the transfer, as Palace seeks to sign replacements before the window closes.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean—have set a new world record for the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, completing the 9,000-mile journey in 139 days. They became the first team to row non-stop from Peru to Australia, overcoming storms, injuries, and even a man-overboard incident. The remarkable feat also served as a fundraiser, generating over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their arrival in Cairns, Australia was met with a celebratory welcome from family and supporters.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the top private colleges in the U.S. that deliver the best return on investment, with Princeton University leading the list. The analysis considered factors such as financial aid, net cost of attendance, and median post-graduation earnings. The report notes that many top-tier private schools with large endowments offer generous financial aid, including "no-loan" policies, which significantly reduces the financial burden on students and contributes to a strong long-term value proposition.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist firm, has acquired a significant stake in Rexford Industrial Realty, a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in Southern California industrial properties. The move signals that Elliott may push for substantial changes at the company, which has been criticized for poor corporate governance and a stock price that trades at a discount to its net asset value. Elliott's involvement could lead to a strategic review, better capital allocation, or even make Rexford an attractive acquisition target for larger players in the REIT industry.

          <p>Coldplay has announced the rescheduling of the final two London dates of its world tour due to a planned strike on the London Underground. The band stated that without Tube service, it would be "impossible" for the 82,000 fans to travel to and from Wembley Stadium, and therefore no event license could be granted for the nights of September 7th and 8th. The shows have been moved to September 6th and 12th respectively, with all original tickets remaining valid for the new dates.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with narrower eligibility criteria than in previous years. The new shots are now authorized for adults aged 65 and older, as well as for younger individuals with certain underlying medical conditions that place them at higher risk for severe illness. While officials have stated that anyone can still receive a vaccine after consulting with their doctor, the more limited formal approval may create access barriers, particularly at pharmacies in states with restrictive regulations on off-label vaccine administration.</p>

His recovery was arduous, but 18 months later, he shows no signs of organ rejection and has returned to his pulpit. His journey highlights the severity of the often-misdiagnosed disease and serves as an inspiring story of survival.</p>

          <p>The landscape of Indian food in the United States is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond "cheap food and curry houses" to embrace upscale and fine-dining experiences. A new wave of restaurants is earning Michelin stars and attracting long waitlists by focusing on sophisticated, hyper-regional Indian cuisines rather than stereotypical menus. This evolution is driven by younger consumers' growing interest in global flavors, a rising and affluent Indian American population, and increasing attention from private equity investors looking to capitalize on the trend.</p>
