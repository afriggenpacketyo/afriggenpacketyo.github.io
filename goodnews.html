          <p>Former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, aiming to succeed retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis in 2026. In his campaign launch, Cooper framed the election as a crucial fight to protect the middle class, criticizing D.C. politicians for increasing national debt and cutting programs to fund tax breaks for billionaires. His campaign quickly demonstrated strong initial support, raising $1 million within hours of his announcement. Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, welcomed Cooper to the race, viewing him as a formidable candidate capable of flipping the North Carolina Senate seat.</p>

          <p>Actress Jamie Lee Curtis revealed her intention to gradually exit Hollywood on her own terms, a decision profoundly influenced by witnessing her famous parents, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, experience industry rejection as they aged. She expressed a proactive desire to "leave the party before I'm no longer invited," having prepared for this transition for decades to avoid a similar painful erosion of livelihood. Curtis, an Academy Award winner known for iconic roles since her 1978 debut in "Halloween," aims to maintain integrity and professionalism in her craft while transitioning away from the spotlight.</p>

          <p>Wu Yiquan, a Chinese AI researcher, has gained significant media attention for his impressive basketball skills, particularly after scoring 22 points as a defender for the West Lake team in a provincial league qualifier. In an interview, Wu drew insightful parallels between scientific research and basketball, noting the inherent unpredictability in both fields. He emphasized that pre-game analysis often differs from the actual situation on the court, which tests one's ability to adapt in real-time. Wu finds the dynamic and adaptive nature of basketball particularly captivating, underscoring his dual talents.</p>

          <p>Strategy Inc.

The stock's rate will adjust to maintain a market price around $100. However, an equity analyst cautioned that despite MSTR's substantial Bitcoin assets, STRC has no direct claim on them, and the company lacks the earnings to cover dividend payments, relying on Bitcoin appreciation. This reliance on volatile Bitcoin prices creates significant long-term risk for investors, potentially leading to dividend cuts or suspensions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "4% rule" for annuities is a guideline that helps retirees compare an annuity's guaranteed income stream against the safe withdrawal rate from a traditional investment portfolio. While the original 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% of savings annually, annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income, protecting against outliving funds. This rule serves as a benchmark for evaluating whether an annuity provides comparable or superior value, highlighting benefits like longevity protection, but also drawing attention to potential drawbacks such as lack of inflation adjustment or flexibility compared to traditional portfolios. Ultimately, blending annuities with other strategies can offer a balanced retirement income plan. (not investment advice)</p>
