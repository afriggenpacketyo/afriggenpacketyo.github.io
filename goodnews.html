        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports increased by 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China, though overall figures missed Reuters' estimates. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to drop by 13.3%, despite a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs, with auto shipments taking a significant hit. Semiconductor exports were a significant driver of overall growth. The data coincides with Sanae Takaichi taking office as Japan's first female prime minister, whose economic policies, including loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, are anticipated to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive and benefiting the nation's key exporters.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, clarifying that cold water doesn't enhance shine and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which require a haircut. They emphasize that products merely offer temporary cosmetic fixes and warn against overspending on false promises. The experts also stress that hair does not "self-clean," highlighting the necessity of regular washing for scalp health, as infrequent cleaning allows oil, dirt, yeast, and bacteria to build up, worsening conditions like dandruff and causing odor. They recommend washing every other day for oily hair or frequent product users.</p>

          <p>Capital One shares rose after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, driven by improved credit quality performance and a significant revenue increase. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded estimates, despite some impact from Discover acquisition integration expenses. The strong credit metrics, including declining net charge-offs, helped alleviate investor worries about its exposure to the subprime market, especially after recent collapses in the auto lending sector. The article highlights the transformative potential of the Discover acquisition, which is progressing as planned, and a new $16 billion share repurchase authorization, further strengthening Capital One's balance sheet.

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences in their impact on patients. The research, which analyzed 151 studies of 30 common drugs, found some medications could cause up to 2kg weight gain or heart rate variations of 21 beats per minute within eight weeks. Academics emphasize the importance of matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and health conditions, rather than a generic approach, to improve treatment adherence and overall health outcomes. This new data aims to empower doctors and patients in making more informed treatment choices.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles was diverted to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in one of the layers of the windshield, which may have been caused by a weather balloon. WindBorne Systems, the balloon's owner, is cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation. The multi-layer windshield is designed to remain functional despite damage, and the 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely without injury. NTSB investigators are examining the windshield and reviewing flight data to determine the object that struck the Boeing 737 mid-flight, ensuring aviation safety protocols are upheld.</p>

          <p>Fiona Eastwood, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, which operates Legoland and Alton Towers, identifies people choosing to stay home with their digital devices as the company's "biggest competition." She positions theme park visits as the "perfect antidote" to increasing screen time, especially for families seeking shared physical experiences. Despite a recent dip in consumer confidence and fewer international visitors, Merlin attracted nearly 63 million people in 2024, with seasonal events like Halloween proving highly profitable, sometimes accounting for half of a park's annual profits. The company is investing £85 million in immersive experiences, including Minecraft-themed attractions, to draw digital-savvy audiences into physical play and maintain growth.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lauded Viktor Gyokeres' overall impact on the team after the £64m striker ended a seven-game goal drought with two goals in a 4-0 Champions League win over Atletico Madrid. Despite earlier frustrations, Gyokeres' persistence and physical contribution have made Arsenal "much more unpredictable," according to Arteta, opening spaces for other players. His teammates showed strong support, pushing him to receive crowd adulation after his goals, demonstrating squad togetherness. This performance, bringing his tally to five goals in 12 matches, is hoped to mark the beginning of a prolific scoring spell for the 27-year-old, significantly enhancing the team's attacking prowess.</p>

          <p>La Liga announced the cancellation of the Villarreal-Barcelona match scheduled for Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" and critical responses within Spain. The decision, made with promoter Relevent, was deeply regretted by La Liga, which views staging matches abroad as crucial for global growth and competitiveness against leagues like the Premier League. The move faced strong opposition, including player protests over a perceived "lack of transparency," and complaints from Real Madrid, whose manager Xabi Alonso argued it "distorts the competition." Villarreal's manager Marcelino criticized the timing of the announcement, calling it a lack of respect.</p>

          <p>An article suggests that President Donald Trump, likened to a "paramount leader" in his administration, could act as a unique guardrail in US-China relations by personally tempering the influence of his China hawks. Despite ongoing trade tensions and threats of new tariffs, Trump has reportedly shown restraint in not antagonizing Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's red lines such as Taiwan. Analysts believe Trump's direct control over policy and emphasis on leader-to-leader diplomacy means his personal instincts play a crucial role in shaping ties, potentially preventing further escalation despite the structural competition between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Around 2,000 Waymo driverless taxis are under federal investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) after an incident where a vehicle navigated around a stopped school bus while children were disembarking. The Waymo initially stopped but then drove past the bus, ignoring its extended stop arm and flashing red light. Waymo has made software updates and plans more, stating the bus partially blocked a driveway and the vehicle maintained a safe distance from children. This incident highlights ongoing safety and regulatory challenges for autonomous vehicles, including legal loopholes regarding traffic violations by driverless cars.</p>

Atlas features include chatting with websites, finding products, and automating tasks like booking appointments. OpenAI seeks to establish ChatGPT as the default operating system for the AI age, leveraging its 800 million weekly users and substantial investment from Nvidia, despite Google's existing infrastructure and market share.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Shares Decline Following Earnings Miss Attributed to Brazilian Tax Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 17:32:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares fell approximately 7% after the company missed its third-quarter earnings estimates, attributing the shortfall to an ongoing tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. A 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country was not factored into previous forecasts, and Netflix decided to charge its impact to the third quarter. Despite the earnings miss, revenue rose 17% year-over-year, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and its best-ever ad sales quarter. The company expects continued revenue growth for the fourth quarter, with a strong content slate planned. (not investment advice)</p>
