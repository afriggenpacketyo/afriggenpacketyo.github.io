          <p>The Ixil Mayan community in Guatemala is mobilizing against transnational corporations that have invaded their ancestral lands to install hydroelectric plants without community consultation. The community has faced multiple invasions, including the Spanish conquest, land dispossession, and a genocide in 1982. The community is invoking the International Labour Organization's Convention 169, which guarantees indigenous peoples the right to decide their own development priorities. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy after initially pausing it due to cost concerns.
