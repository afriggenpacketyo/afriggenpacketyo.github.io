The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China will be represented by Vice Premier He Lifeng. These talks follow a recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, both expressing a desire to avert a full-blown trade war after weeks of heightened tensions and uncertainty following Trump's announcement of import tariffs on China and other trading partners in April.

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of its offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that urgent action is needed to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans, and the announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, with the government having carried out detailed assessments into the harms caused by bottom trawling. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

His comments come as carmakers were mired in a brutal price war on the mainland, with leading players such as BYD, Geely and start-up Leapmotor slashing prices of 70 models by as much as 20 per cent in the last week of May to retain market share. Chinese carmakers‚Äô discounts more than doubled to a record 16.8 per cent in April from 8.3 per cent in 2024, according to a JPMorgan Chase report in May.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, the winner of a record 45 elite-level sumo tournaments, plans to remain involved with sumo despite severing ties with the sport's ruling body. His retirement from the Japan Sumo Association was formalized, following the indefinite closure of the Miyagino stable that he had overseen due to a physical abuse scandal. At a press conference, Hakuho stated his desire to promote sumo from an outside perspective, focusing on projects to spread the sport globally. Despite his split with the sumo hierarchy, Hakuho will be remembered as an all-time great for his dominant career and record-breaking 1,187 match wins.</p>
