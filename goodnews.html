        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK court has dismissed a terror charge against Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara of the Irish rap group Kneecap, citing a technical error where prosecutors missed the deadline. The charge stemmed from O hAnnaidh allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a London concert in 2024, an organization proscribed as terrorist in Britain. The rapper, along with supporters including Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill, praised the decision, asserting it was a calculated attempt to silence those speaking out against the Israeli actions in Gaza. This article highlights the ongoing political controversies surrounding Kneecap, which has previously faced criticism and bans for statements seemingly glorifying militant groups. The band uses its platform to address issues like working-class life and Irish reunification.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has significantly escalated the AI arms race by securing massive infrastructure deals, including a $100 billion investment from Nvidia and a $400 billion commitment with Oracle and SoftBank for its "Stargate" project. CEO Sam Altman's vision involves spending trillions on data centers, requiring immense energy, to meet surging demand for AI models. Despite burning billions and relying on external capital, the company projects $125 billion in revenue by 2029, signaling a bold, high-risk bet on future AI growth. Industry experts view this expansion as existential for the race to superintelligence, underscoring the critical need for vast computing power and data. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure, remained stable at 2.9% annually in August, precisely matching economists' predictions. The broader PCE index, however, saw a slight increase to 2.7% year-over-year, its highest level since February. This article highlights that despite a general decline in prices since the Fed's aggressive rate hikes, inflation stubbornly persists above the central bank's 2% target. The Fed recently enacted its first rate cut of the year to support a weakening job market but is proceeding cautiously, particularly regarding the potential inflationary effects of President Trump's sweeping import tariffs.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing a mandatory digital ID scheme, intended to prove identity and right to work using smartphone technology, aiming to reduce illegal employment. Sir Keir Starmer's administration asserts that by the end of the parliament, this digital ID will be compulsory for all workers, making it harder to use fake documents and curbing one of the "key pull factors" for illegal migration. While proponents suggest it could streamline access to public services, critics raise concerns about privacy and whether it will genuinely solve illegal working, pointing to other European countries where such schemes exist but illegal employment persists. The article notes the scheme will take time to implement, likely by 2028.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reinstated Boeing's authority to self-certify its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft before delivery to customers, marking a significant step in the manufacturer regaining regulator confidence. This decision reverses restrictions put in place after two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2019 and subsequent production defects on 787s in 2022. The FAA affirmed that this move prioritizes safety and follows a comprehensive review of Boeing's ongoing production quality. This article highlights that the change will enable FAA inspectors to concentrate additional surveillance efforts directly on the production process, rather than final certification, with Boeing's stock experiencing a notable rise following the announcement.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Bill Seeks to Clarify Social Security Retirement Age Terminology</h2>

          <p>Congress is considering the Claiming Age Clarity Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at simplifying Social Security's retirement age terminology to help beneficiaries better understand their options. The proposed changes would rename "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age," "full retirement age" (66-67) to "standard benefit age," and "delayed retirement age" (70) to "maximum benefit age." This article explains that the current language is often confusing, with only 21% of adults correctly identifying their full benefit age. Proponents believe clearer terms could positively influence claiming behavior and enhance financial security in retirement, although discussions about actually raising the retirement age remain contentious.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the company owning Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a notable surge of over 6% in premarket trading after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, set to take effect on October 1. This article highlights Trump's justification that these tariffs are intended to shield "large Truck Company Manufacturers" in the U.S. from what he termed "unfair outside competition." Analysts from Bank of America pointed out that Paccar, which largely manufactures its U.S. trucks domestically, previously faced a significant cost disadvantage against competitors in Mexico. The new tariff is anticipated to mitigate this issue, thereby strengthening Paccar's competitive standing in the market. (not investment advice)</p>
