        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Budget Committee reconvened to attempt to advance President Trump's domestic policy bill after facing resistance from conservative Republicans who deemed the spending cuts insufficient. Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the legislation, which extends tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, to the House floor before Memorial Day. Conservatives are pushing for Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while some Republicans from blue states are demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Negotiations are ongoing to address these concerns and secure enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret within its walls: 70-year-old murals that have led some in the art community to dub it "the Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s under the guidance of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, the frescoes depict biblical scenes with creative freedom. A recent website dedicated to the murals has sparked renewed interest in the Meeting House, which continues to serve as a space for community gatherings and artistic events, inspiring art lovers decades after their creation.</p>

Cool's achievement has been hailed by fellow climbers, recognizing his experience and strength in the mountaineering community.

          <p>Portugal's governing right-of-center Democratic Alliance secured victory in the recent snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party once again failed to achieve a majority. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation following his party's second-place finish, which saw them losing seats and drawing close to the far-right Chega party. The final results may shift depending on the votes from abroad, potentially impacting the distribution of seats.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, baffling scientists as to its origin. Named Teleios, after the ancient Greek word for "perfection," the object appears to be a supernova remnant, but its near-perfect symmetry and lack of X-ray emissions challenge existing models. The object's distance remains uncertain, with two possible distances suggesting vastly different sizes and ages for the remnant. Further observations are needed to fully understand the nature and formation of this unusual cosmic phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a challenging race against George Simion, a right-wing nationalist. This election followed months of political instability and a previously annulled presidential race due to allegations of Russian interference. Dan emphasized unity and profound change in Romania, attracting over six million votes. While Simion initially claimed victory, he later conceded on Facebook, averting a planned protest by his supporters. The election highlighted divisions within Romania regarding its relationship with the EU and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests China's yuan has the potential to challenge the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. To push back against the dollar, China must "deepen" its financial markets so foreigners can better access yuan-denominated stocks, bonds and other assets. The economist cited China's existing "connect" schemes with Hong Kong as a model, through which foreign investors can buy mainland Chinese bonds and stocks without special licences.</p>
