          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed varied results as trading commenced for the week, with investors closely watching the Reserve Bank of Australia's two-day policy meeting. Analysts anticipate the RBA will maintain its current cash rate, though they note increasing tension from recent data showing potential upside risks to inflation. While markets in South Korea and Australia saw gains, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices experienced declines after reaching a record high the previous week. This activity follows a positive end to the week on Wall Street, where major averages climbed after the release of key U.S. inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a pivotal parliamentary election, Moldova's ruling pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has secured a decisive lead, signaling the country's continued path toward closer ties with the European Union. With the vast majority of votes counted, the PAS party won nearly 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc. The election was framed as a crucial choice between aligning with the EU or Russia, occurring amidst accusations of foreign interference from both sides. The result solidifies the pro-Western trajectory set by President Maia Sandu, despite ongoing political tensions and challenges from pro-Russian opposition.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Tutu Atwell, who had been sparsely targeted through the first three games, became the hero in a 27-20 comeback win against the Indianapolis Colts. With less than two minutes remaining, Atwell caught a pass from Matthew Stafford and turned it into a game-winning 88-yard touchdown. The victory improved the Rams' record to 3-1 and showcased the team's resilience after a tough loss the previous week. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes in total, while the Rams' defense successfully limited the NFL's leading rusher, Jonathan Taylor, helping to secure the hard-fought win.</p>

Despite entering the Sunday singles matches with a commanding seven-point lead, Europe faced a fierce American comeback that tightened the contest significantly. The winning point was ultimately secured by Tyrrell Hatton, while Shane Lowry's crucial putt on the 18th hole ensured Europe would at least retain the trophy. The victory marks Europe's first Ryder Cup win on U.S. soil since 2012 and solidifies captain Luke Donald's successful leadership after also guiding the team to victory in Rome in 2023.</p>

          <p>A recent profile explores how Dana White transformed the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) from a near-bankrupt, unsanctioned organization into a global sports empire valued at over $15 billion. After convincing friends to purchase the UFC for $2 million over two decades ago, White's forceful and unconventional leadership style propelled the mixed martial arts league into the mainstream. The article highlights his early partnership with Donald Trump, who provided a venue when others refused, and their enduring friendship that may lead to a UFC event at the White House. The UFC's success culminated in a recent $7.7 billion media rights deal with Paramount Skydance.</p>

The article highlights McIlroy's description of winning an away Ryder Cup as one of the greatest achievements in modern golf, a feat made more challenging by the hostile crowd environment. Despite the intense pressure and abuse from some spectators, McIlroy contributed significantly to his team's success throughout the competition. His singles match against world number one Scottie Scheffler was less a showcase of top-tier golf and more a battle of attrition, reflecting the physical and emotional toll of the week-long event.</p>

Murphy did not take a definitive lead until the evening session and had to win the final four consecutive frames to secure the victory. The win marks Murphy's first ranking title in over two years and earns him a £100,000 prize, while he expressed a desire to return to a level of consistent, multi-title-winning performance.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new Labour government initiative aimed at eliminating long-term youth unemployment by offering guaranteed paid work placements. Under the plan, young people who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months without employment or education will be provided a placement, with potential benefit sanctions for those who refuse without a valid reason. The policy builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and aims to help young people develop skills for full-time employment. The announcement comes as the number of 16-24 year-olds not in education, employment, or training has reached an 11-year high.</p>

He posits that unlike the dot-com era, which was fueled by speculative companies with massive debt and little revenue, the AI buildout is being driven by established, cash-rich tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google who see it as a necessity for maintaining market dominance. While acknowledging public skepticism about AI's current tangible benefits, Cramer asserts that the spending is a strategic long-term investment by proven companies, not a speculative frenzy based on unproven business models.

          <p>Asian nations are being urged to monitor the upcoming 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as the outcome could significantly impact their economic interests. Trade and investment from Asia into the three North American countries have grown substantially, with Asian exports to the region reaching $1.7 trillion in 2024. Much of this investment, particularly in Mexico, is driven by a desire to leverage USMCA's tariff preferences and gain better market access. The article suggests that instead of reacting defensively, Asian economies should actively participate in the public consultation process to help shape the debate and protect their growing economic ties.</p>
