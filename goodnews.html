          <p>Ten Americans held in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, have been freed and are returning to the U.S. following a complex prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and were allegedly gang members, to Venezuela. In addition to the Americans, Venezuela also released dozens of its own political prisoners. The swap was described as a humanitarian agreement and successfully concluded after tense, "down-to-the-wire" negotiations.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, previously deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador, have been sent to Venezuela as part of a major prisoner exchange. The Trump administration had deported the men, alleging they were gang members, under the authority of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. In exchange for their return, Venezuela released ten detained Americans and a number of Venezuelan political prisoners. Civil liberties groups have criticized the initial deportations, noting many of the men lacked criminal records and were denied due process.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually undertaking missions to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still viewed by a large majority as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. The poll also suggests that Americans believe the space program yields technological benefits for society as a whole.</p>

          <p>The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the U.S. Postal Service, seeking to quell concerns raised by his background as a former FedEx board member. In his first message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity within the executive branch. While he plans to assess and modify the ongoing "Delivering for America" plan, his statements have temporarily eased worries among postal unions about potential privatization under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nissan Rogue is a compact SUV praised for its comfortable seating, practical storage, and a new hands-free driving system option. A new Rock Creek model, which was tested for this article, adds off-road capabilities with all-wheel drive, all-terrain tires, and a specialized suspension. While its 1.5-liter turbocharged engine is powerful, the powertrain can sometimes feel unresponsive or jerky in routine driving. Despite some lack of refinement in its road handling, the Rogue's spacious interior and advanced technology make it a strong contender in its segment.</p>

At the White House signing ceremony, Trump hailed the bipartisan bill as a major step for financial technology, suggesting it could be the "greatest revolution" since the internet. The law allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins under clear consumer protection guardrails. The legislation passed after the President reportedly helped persuade a dozen Republican holdouts to support it.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. The resolution of this dispute is a significant victory for Chevron, removing the uncertainty that had weighed on its stock. Exxon stated that it disagrees with the panel's interpretation but will respect the outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Policy Center indicates that the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will provide tax cuts for all income groups in 2026, with an average household saving of around $2,900. The law extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips. However, the benefits are disproportionately skewed towards higher earners, with the top 20% of households receiving about 60% of the total tax reduction. Lower-income households will see a smaller average savings both in dollars and as a percentage of their income. (not investment advice)</p>
