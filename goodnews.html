          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have finalized an agreement to establish a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi, making the UAE a rising power in AI. President Trump visited the site, which will be supplied by American-made AI chips and is expected to be the largest project of its kind outside the United States. The project is part of the "U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership," and will help American AI companies serve customers within a 2,000-mile radius of the campus. Concerns have been raised regarding protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China, given the UAE's authoritarian government and ties to China.</p>

          <p>Cava, the Mediterranean fast-casual chain, reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, demonstrating double-digit same-store sales growth of 10.8%.

Cava's CFO noted an increase in premium attachment and positive traffic across various demographics, indicating diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite its strong quarterly performance, Cava reiterated its same-store sales forecast of a 6% to 8% increase for the year.</p>

          <p>Prince Royce has released a new album featuring reinterpretations of famous English pop songs from artists like The Beatles and Stevie Wonder, translated into 'spanglish' with a bachata twist. The album, a concept suggested by Sony Music Latin, includes tracks from the '70s, '80s, and '90s, aiming to evoke nostalgia while respecting the original versions. Royce emphasized the importance of maintaining the essence of each song, keeping recognizable elements like choruses and titles in English. The selection process involved obtaining permissions for each song, a process that took about 10 months.</p>

          <p>Canada has quietly become a global leader in digital assets, enacting rules for crypto as early as 2014 and repeatedly evolving its regulatory guidance. This clarity has made Toronto a hub for blockchain growth, attracting attention from Wall Street, as evidenced by Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi. JPMorgan, Ondo, and Chainlink announced a $100 billion bet on blockchain at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, signaling further growth in the Canadian crypto sector. The U.S. has begun easing restrictions on banks handling crypto, which may shift the landscape in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legislation winding its way through the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, disappointing many seniors. The exclusion is due to rules prohibiting changes to Social Security through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and Medicare, potentially depleting the Social Security trust fund in 2032.</p>

Concerns have been raised about the decline in children's reading for fun and the potential impact of analytical approaches to reading in schools.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and raise the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, but the plan has limitations. The proposal does nothing for the 17 million children currently excluded from the credit and requires both parents to have a Social Security number if filing jointly. While the credit starts to phase out for high-income earners, middle-income families currently see the biggest benefit. The House bill is taking the child tax credit away from 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present.</p>
