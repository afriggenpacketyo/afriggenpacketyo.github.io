          <p>A federal judge has lifted a stop-work order imposed by the Trump administration, allowing Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, was over 80% complete when the Interior Department halted its progress. Orsted successfully argued that the order was arbitrary and unlawful. This ruling represents a significant development for the U.S. offshore wind industry and a setback for the administration's efforts to curtail it.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, according to new sales data. This shift marks a significant comeback for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a controversial marketing partnership. Modelo's decline is attributed to challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in market leadership reflects evolving consumer preferences and the lingering impact of brand controversies in the beverage industry.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake centered near Berkeley struck the San Francisco Bay Area in the early morning, waking many residents. The United States Geological Survey reported that over 22,000 people felt the shaking, which caused objects to fall from shelves but resulted in no reports of major damage or injuries. As a precaution, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) operated trains at reduced speeds for track inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The event serves as a reminder of the region's seismic activity and the importance of preparedness for larger quakes.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid dismissed a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants, telling reporters not to "make too much of it." The interaction, caught on camera, showed the two yelling after the offense failed to score. Reid framed the incident as a positive display of passion from an emotional player, stating the team needed more "juice" during a lackluster second quarter. This is not the first public sideline spat between the two, who had a similar, more physical encounter during Super Bowl LVIII.</p>

          <h2>New Study Links Chronic Insomnia to a 40% Higher Risk of Cognitive Impairment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 13:00:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent research suggests that chronic insomnia may be a significant and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, linking the sleep disorder to a 40% increased risk of cognitive impairment. The study also brought positive news, finding that individuals who successfully treated their insomnia or improved their sleep quality did not exhibit the same elevated risk. To improve sleep, experts recommend establishing a consistent sleep schedule, practicing relaxation techniques like meditation, and limiting evening consumption of alcohol, caffeine, and exposure to screens. The findings underscore the critical role of sleep in long-term brain health.</p>

The event has sold over 440,000 tickets in total, more than triple the amount from the previous tournament. This success is attributed to strategic scheduling of all matches on weekends, competitive ticket pricing starting at just £10, and spreading venues across the country to maximize accessibility. The tournament has run at nearly 94% capacity, showcasing the sport's growing popularity.</p>

          <p>An elk nicknamed Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. Wildlife officials tranquilized the young male near a motorway, fitted him with a GPS tag, and released him on the Czech-Austrian border. It is hoped he will join the small elk population in the nearby Sumava forest. Since June, Emil's journey has spanned approximately 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements tracked by thousands of followers in dedicated online groups.</p>

          <p>As part of a deal to avoid a U.S. ban, TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm will be copied and re-trained exclusively using American user data. A new U.S.-based joint venture, involving investors like Oracle and Silver Lake, will operate the app, with Oracle also serving as the security provider auditing the source code and system. This arrangement is a key component of the White House's plan to address national security concerns related to the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deal aims to isolate U.S. operations and data while allowing the popular app to continue serving its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist who has been imprisoned for six years. Abdel Fattah, a leading figure in the 2011 uprising, was serving a five-year sentence for "spreading false news." His case had drawn significant international attention and condemnation from human rights groups, with his mother recently ending a nine-month hunger strike to advocate for his release. The pardon was welcomed by his family and human rights organizations, who hope it signals a broader shift in the country's approach to political prisoners.</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer advised investors to view recent weakness in Boeing's stock as a buying opportunity to build a position in the aerospace giant. He also expressed continued optimism for two other industrial companies, DuPont and Honeywell, citing their planned business spinoffs as a catalyst for future growth. Cramer noted that both companies are performing well and that such corporate separations have historically been successful for shareholders. His commentary comes as the broader market takes a pause after reaching record highs, driven largely by megacap technology stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
