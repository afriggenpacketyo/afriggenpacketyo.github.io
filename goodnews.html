          <h2>Southwest Airlines to Initiate Checked Bag Fees and Modify Fare Structure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 07:45:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, introducing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, effective Wednesday. This change comes after pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which sought significant business model changes. Certain exemptions apply, including for Rapid Rewards loyalty members, Business Select fare customers, and those with Southwest co-branded credit cards. Additionally, Southwest is launching a new Basic fare that restricts ticket changes, prioritizes later boarding, and shortens fare credit expiration, while discontinuing the Wanna Get Away fare. The airline anticipates increased carry-on luggage and is installing larger overhead bins to accommodate this shift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. rose by an estimated 76% year-over-year in April, while shipments from China fell by approximately 76%, according to data from Canalys. This surge reflects Apple's strategy to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China by increasing its manufacturing capacity in India. However, analysts predict this growth may plateau due to India's limited manufacturing capacity and potential protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing. Despite Trump's exemption of iPhones from reciprocal tariffs, he has threatened tariffs on all iPhone shipments if manufacturing does not occur domestically.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish Lions board is considering a proposal to implement a sudden-death extra time, known as 'golden point,' if the deciding third Test against Australia ends in a draw. Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the idea, aiming to provide a more engaging conclusion for fans. The 2017 series against New Zealand ended in a draw, which was considered anticlimactic. Super Rugby Pacific has already introduced 'golden point' for regular-season games, with a 10-minute extra time period, while knockout games use standard extra time followed by 'golden point' if needed.</p>

The police's rapid response aligns with recommendations from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services to communicate facts effectively online.

          <p>Politicians have focused on boosting manufacturing in the U.S., raising the question of what makes these jobs so special. While some economists dismiss this as nostalgia, data suggests that manufacturing still pays a premium, particularly in advanced sectors. A recent study found that workers moving from restaurants to manufacturing receive a 35% pay bump, higher than many other industries. However, the unionization rate in manufacturing has declined, and the attractiveness of factory work is debated. The presence of expensive machinery and the need for specialized skills contribute to the higher pay in this sector.</p>
