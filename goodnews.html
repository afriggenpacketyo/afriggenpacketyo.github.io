          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for improved mechanisms to regulate the exercise of power as a key strategy in combating corruption. Speaking at an event, he stressed that power is granted by the people and must be clear, transparent, and traceable to prevent abuse. This statement comes as millions of officials participate in an education campaign focused on Xi's austerity rules, which Beijing views as crucial for maintaining the party's public image and legitimacy. The initiative aims to identify and address systemic shortcomings and loopholes in the power structure.</p>

          <p>Major banks and financial analysts are divided on the potential economic impact of President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Some institutions, like Citi and Nomura, argue the legislation will provide a necessary boost to the U.S. economy by preventing the expiration of 2017 tax cuts and stimulating investment. However, other experts and the Congressional Budget Office express serious concerns, highlighting that the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit. Critics also point to poorly designed tax cuts and the administrative burden on the IRS as significant drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City has been unexpectedly eliminated from the Club World Cup after a 4-3 loss to Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in a dramatic last-16 match. The game went into extra time, where Al-Hilal scored twice, with Marcos Leonardo securing the winning goal in the 112th minute. The defeat was compounded by an injury setback for City's key midfielder, Rodri, who was substituted after coming on as a replacement. Manager Pep Guardiola lamented his team's lack of clinical finishing despite creating numerous chances, ending their journey in the inaugural 32-team tournament.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece examines the notable absence of France's history of slavery and colonialism in its national cinema, especially when compared to the numerous American films on the subject. The author notes that despite France's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, French audiences often learn about it through Hollywood productions. The article praises recent, rare films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" for finally tackling these subjects but laments their marginalization within the French film industry. It concludes that while French audiences seem ready to confront this history, the cinematic establishment remains hesitant.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has appreciated against the U.S. dollar and is forecast to continue its gains through 2025, with some analysts predicting it will break the 7-per-dollar level within six months. This trend is supported by China's macroeconomic data, which has been more resilient than expected, particularly in exports. Concurrently, growing investor concerns about the sustainability of U.S. government debt and loose fiscal policy are contributing to a weaker outlook for the dollar. The People's Bank of China has reflected this strength by setting its daily reference rate at its strongest level in months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the need for emerging nations to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure their technological and strategic autonomy. Panelists argued that many prominent AI models are English-centric, failing to capture the unique languages, cultures, and priorities of other regions like Southeast Asia. They proposed that using open-source AI models and leveraging cloud computing services can democratize access to the technology. This approach would allow countries to build AI systems tailored to their specific needs, fostering a more inclusive and competitive global AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed unexpected growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, contrasting with the official government PMI which reported a third consecutive month of contraction. Analysts attribute the divergence to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey potentially reflecting a delayed positive response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction. Despite the expansion in production, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, indicating potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law major housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by significantly reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, which Newsom pushed through a reluctant legislature using budget-related tactics, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy and often litigious CEQA review process. While developers and housing advocates praise the move as a transformative step to address the state's housing crisis, some progressive lawmakers and labor unions raised concerns. The legislation is considered one of the most consequential changes to the state's development rules in decades.</p>
