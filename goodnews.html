          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump following his election on an anti-Trump platform, aiming to prevent Canada from becoming integrated into the United States. Carney emphasized Canada's independence, stating it was 'not for sale,' while Trump offered a playful retort. Despite Trump's pre-meeting criticisms of Canada on social media, the tone during their public meeting was more conciliatory, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. The leaders then proceeded to a private working lunch to discuss trade, security, and defense issues, aiming to address the strained relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Despite Warren Buffett's announcement of his intention to leave the CEO role at Berkshire Hathaway, retail investors poured over $24 million into the company's Class B stock. This shows confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel and the company's future. The article notes that while Abel may not have Buffett's stock-picking prowess, investors seem reassured by Buffett's plan to remain involved as chairman. Buffett himself stated that keeping all his shares was an 'economic decision' because he believes Berkshire's prospects are better under Abel's management (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen, citing an agreement where the group promised to end attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis have not publicly confirmed the agreement, but Oman's foreign ministry stated that a ceasefire had been brokered. This announcement follows a period of U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets in response to the group's disruption of crucial shipping lanes. While the Houthis initially vowed to retaliate against Israeli strikes, Trump claims they have now 'capitulated' and seek an end to hostilities.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump digressed to criticize the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, calling it 'a disaster' and blaming 'woke' construction workers. He claimed the project is over budget and that the problems stem from a focus on DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) rather than using 'good, hard, tough, mean construction workers.' The Obama Foundation responded, stating that Trump's comments were not based in fact and that construction is ongoing with union labor, expecting the center to open in 2026.</p>
