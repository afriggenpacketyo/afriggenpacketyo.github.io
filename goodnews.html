          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 01:15:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the story of Rory McIlroy's historic course-record 61 at Royal Portrush during the 2005 North of Ireland Championship when he was just 16 years old. Through interviews with his playing partners and contemporaries, it paints a picture of a burgeoning superstar whose talent was already undeniable. The narrative details how the crowd swelled as word of his incredible performance spread, culminating in a dramatic final putt. The piece contrasts this early triumph with his later professional struggles, including his emotional missed cut at the 2019 Open at the same venue, setting the stage for his return.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Toymaker Pop Mart's Stock Declines Despite Projecting Strong First-Half Profit Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 01:15:26 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company forecasting a significant increase in first-half earnings, with profits expected to rise by at least 350%. The company, known for its popular Labubu character and blind-box sales model, attributed its strong performance to growing global brand recognition and cost optimization. However, some analysts suggest the stock drop reflects investor belief that the company's rapid growth may have peaked, prompting profit-taking. Despite the pullback, many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the brand's consumer appeal in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor firm ASML announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions, with net sales reaching 7.7 billion euros. The company's net bookings, a crucial indicator of future demand, came in at 5.5 billion euros, significantly higher than the 4.19 billion euros expected. As the sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines essential for advanced chip production, ASML's performance is a key barometer for the global semiconductor industry. The company continues to navigate uncertainty from U.S. tariff policies while rolling out its next-generation High NA EUV tools. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a supply chain expo in Beijing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's generative AI models from companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu as "world class." He highlighted the country's open-source approach to AI as a catalyst for global progress, enabling broader participation in the AI revolution. His visit comes as Nvidia expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, following a temporary halt due to U.S. export requirements. Huang emphasized the importance of collaboration and noted that over 1.5 million developers in China currently build on Nvidia's platform.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China under the Biden administration, stated that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path towards some kind of a deal." Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns argued that strong economic self-interest on both sides makes a trade agreement logical, pushing back against the idea that China has the upper hand in negotiations. He described the economic relationship as symbiotic, with thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. being China's largest export market. His comments come amid a 90-day trade truce as both nations work toward a more durable agreement.</p>

          <p>After a key procedural vote on several cryptocurrency regulation bills failed in the House, President Trump intervened to secure their advancement. A group of thirteen House Republicans had initially joined Democrats to block the legislation, but Trump announced that eleven of them agreed to support the bills after a meeting at the White House. The legislative package includes the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins and the CLARITY Act to define rules for digital assets. The initial failure was a rare, albeit temporary, defiance of Trump's direction, and the reversal highlights his significant influence over the Republican conference.</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided for the first time by a home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie.

For the first half of 2025, global EV sales reached 9.1 million units, a 28% year-over-year increase, with China accounting for the majority of sales.

The troops were deployed to address protests related to federal immigration raids, a move that bypassed the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom and prompted a lawsuit from the state. Governor Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as a political maneuver and called for all remaining troops to be sent home.
