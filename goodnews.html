President Trump confirmed the project, which he says is funded by $250 million in private donations from business and tech companies, will not cost taxpayers. The addition is intended to host large events and state visits, with a capacity of nearly 1,000 people. Despite initial claims that it would not interfere with the existing structure, work is visibly underway to alter the historic building.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is not planned for the "immediate future," according to a White House official. This clarification came after a phone call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was deemed productive enough to not require an additional in-person meeting between them. The summit, which was anticipated to occur in Budapest, Hungary, has been called off for now. This development comes as European leaders have voiced support for President Trump's position that the fighting in Ukraine should cease immediately.</p>

          <p>The family of a man who allegedly threatened a mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is being credited with preventing a tragedy. Scott Nelson said his family alerted police after seeing his brother, Billy Joe Cagle, live-streaming his intentions on social media due to mental health struggles. This quick action allowed police to locate and arrest Cagle at the airport, where an AR-15-style rifle was found in his truck. Atlanta's mayor praised the family's vigilance, stating that their decision to "see something, say something" likely saved numerous lives.</p>

          <p>A high court in Bogota has acquitted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe on charges of bribery in criminal proceedings, overturning a previous conviction. The court ruled that the charges had not been proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served as president from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing paramilitary members to lie about his alleged connections to their groups. The case has been politically charged, creating friction between Colombia's current left-wing government and the U.S., which had expressed support for Uribe.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having cut interest rates multiple times, the window for securing high-yield Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts is closing. While current CD rates, often around 4%, still significantly outperform traditional savings accounts, they are lower than the peaks seen in recent years. Financial analysts suggest that savers looking to lock in a predictable, solid return on their funds should act promptly, as further rate cuts are anticipated. This opportunity to earn substantial interest on savings may not reappear for a considerable time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is exploring "strategic alternatives," including a potential sale of the entire company, after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This development comes just months after the entertainment giant announced plans to split into two separate companies by mid-2026. The company's board will now evaluate a range of options, which could include proceeding with the planned separation or pursuing a sale of the whole company or its individual Warner Bros. and Discovery Global businesses. The news caused a significant jump in the company's stock price, with analysts speculating on potential bidders like Paramount Skydance and Comcast.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI chatbot, positioning it as a direct competitor to Google Chrome. The browser, initially available for macOS, integrates ChatGPT directly into the user experience, allowing for seamless interaction with web content through an "Ask ChatGPT" sidebar. CEO Sam Altman stated the goal is to rethink browser functionality, offering features like memory for personalization and an "agent mode" for completing tasks. The announcement led to a roughly 3% drop in the stock price of Google's parent company, Alphabet, signaling a potential shift in the browser market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The eligibility for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out unsecured debts, is primarily determined by an individual's income relative to their state's median income for their household size. A "means test" compares the filer's average monthly income over the last six months to this median. If the income is below the median, they generally qualify; if it is above, they must undergo a more detailed calculation of disposable income after accounting for allowable expenses. For those who do not qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or credit counseling offer other paths to manage overwhelming debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed softening its anti-deforestation law (EUDR), which was designed to ban imports of products linked to deforestation, such as coffee, soy, and palm oil. The proposed changes would move the compliance deadline for large companies to the end of 2025 and simplify requirements for importers and small-hold producers. The original law faced strong opposition from major trading partners who argued it created excessive administrative and cost burdens. The amendments, which still need approval from EU member states and Parliament, represent a move to address these concerns while still pursuing the law's environmental goals.</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has accepted an invitation for urgent talks in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The meeting will focus on China's recent move to tighten export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are critical for the EU's high-tech manufacturing industries. Another key issue is the fallout from the Netherlands' decision to effectively take control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia due to national security concerns. The EU's trade chief described China's restrictions as "unjustified and harmful" and is seeking immediate solutions to prevent further disruption to critical supply chains.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a successful and self-sustaining business model by primarily serving refugee and immigrant patients on Medicaid. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic operates on a walk-in basis and has implemented numerous efficiencies, such as eliminating nurses and streamlining paperwork, to maximize patient volume while keeping costs low. By mastering the Medicaid billing system and choosing to see most other patients for free, the clinic avoids the complexities of private insurance. This unique approach challenges the conventional wisdom that Medicaid is an unprofitable payer and offers a model for providing accessible care to vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg must take the witness stand in an upcoming trial concerning the alleged harmful effects of social media on young users. The judge also ordered Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify, denying their companies' motions to prevent their appearance. In her ruling, the judge stated that the testimony of a CEO is "uniquely relevant" to establishing knowledge of harms and potential negligence. This trial is one of many lawsuits filed against social media companies, accusing them of designing addictive platforms that contribute to mental health issues in minors.</p>
