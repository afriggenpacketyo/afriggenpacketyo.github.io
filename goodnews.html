          <p>Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure company Nebius Group saw its stock soar by over 50% in premarket trading following the announcement of a multi-year, $19.4 billion deal with Microsoft. The agreement involves Nebius providing cloud computing power for AI workloads, specializing in the graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for training advanced AI models. This deal highlights the continued strong demand for AI computing infrastructure, a market where major players like Nvidia also anticipate significant growth. The company itself was spun out from Russian internet giant Yandex in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation as Labour's deputy leader over a tax issue, a contest to find her successor is underway. Key figures who have declared or are expected to run include Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who is seen as a senior cabinet member loyal to the government's direction. Other potential candidates like left-winger Bell Ribeiro-Addy and former Commons leader Lucy Powell represent different factions within the party. This sets the stage for a debate on Labour's future direction, with the winner to be decided by a vote of party members in late October.</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou is reportedly the leading candidate to replace Nuno Espirito Santo as the head coach of Nottingham Forest, following Nuno's dismissal. Nuno was let go after 21 months, despite guiding the club to its highest league finish in decades and qualifying for European competition last season. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season after they finished 17th but won the Europa League, is expected to be appointed before the team's next match. His appointment would make him the eighth permanent manager under the club's current ownership.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article praises a Trump administration reform that makes "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges accessible to most Americans. Previously, these high-deductible, low-premium plans were restricted, primarily to those under 30. The author argues that by granting a "hardship exemption" to a wider population, the reform will make healthcare more affordable, potentially saving families thousands annually and encouraging uninsured individuals to get coverage. The article suggests this move will help stabilize the Obamacare markets by attracting younger, healthier enrollees.</p>

However, Judge Amit Mehta's final decision acknowledged that AI-powered chatbots from competitors like OpenAI represent a potential game-changer, altering the competitive landscape.
