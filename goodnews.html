          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 00:47:06 EDT</div>

          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region, with its epicenter 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System briefly issued a threat, but this was quickly changed to no tsunami warning on its website. Crucially, there were no immediate reports of injuries or significant damages from the seismic event. This area, particularly Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, is prone to such activity, having experienced five powerful quakes, including another 7.4 magnitude tremor, in July 2025.</p>

          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have issued a joint statement calling for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, followed by a permanent ceasefire. The "Quad" countries also put forth a plan for a nine-month transitional process aimed at establishing an independent, civilian-led government with broad legitimacy. This diplomatic initiative seeks to halt the devastating conflict between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces, which has caused tens of thousands of deaths and one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The statement also explicitly rejected any role for violent extremist groups in the transition process.</p>

Crawford, appearing in incredible physical shape, faced a boisterous and largely Mexican crowd that made Alvarez feel like the home fighter at the ceremonial weigh-in. The undefeated Crawford aims to make history by becoming the first male three-division undisputed champion in the modern era, challenging Alvarez's reign across multiple super-middleweight titles. The weigh-in underscored the physical readiness of both fighters and set the stage for a compelling clash of styles and legacies.</p>

          <p>An international team of divers has made a remarkable discovery, locating the incredibly well-preserved remnants of an 8,000-year-old Stone Age settlement on the seabed in Denmark's Bay of Aarhus. Led by underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, the six-year project aims to understand how ancient coastal communities adapted to their environments, revealing artifacts like well-preserved wood, stone tools, animal bones, and a seal tooth. This settlement became submerged due to a massive sea-level rise 8,500 years ago, a rate comparable to current projections for 2100. The discovery is likened to a "time capsule," offering crucial insights into how past societies adjusted to rapidly changing climates, which could inform modern challenges.</p>

          <p>Three elderly Austrian nuns, Sisters Bernadette (88), Regina (86), and Rita (82), have defiantly left the care home where they were placed to return to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen, near Salzburg. They assert they were taken from the convent against their will in December 2023, despite having been granted lifelong residency rights. With the assistance of former students and a locksmith, they successfully regained access to the now-dilapidated convent, where they are happily settling back in, supported by a steady stream of visitors. Church authorities deem their return "completely incomprehensible" due to the convent's unsuitable conditions, but the nuns remain determined to stay, feeling more at home.</p>
