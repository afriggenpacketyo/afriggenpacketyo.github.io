          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 12:01:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll from Demand Progress suggests voters prefer Democratic candidates who focus on curbing corporate power over those who prioritize cutting regulatory bottlenecks to increase production. However, the article argues that this framing presents a false choice, as there's no inherent conflict between regulating corporations and streamlining regulations to foster economic growth and address governance failures. The article suggests that abundance liberalism, which focuses on increasing the supply of housing, energy, and infrastructure, can complement populist policies aimed at redistributing wealth and power. Ultimately, the author contends that the debate should center on the accuracy of different policy analyses rather than the rhetorical appeal of populist messages, because effective governance requires understanding the root causes of societal problems. The piece highlights the importance of addressing policy failures rather than focusing solely on populist rhetoric.</p>

          <p>South Korea anticipates Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party will become its next president, following a snap election triggered by the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The election saw a high voter turnout of 77.8%, with exit polls indicating a significant lead for Lee over his conservative rival. Lee's victory would restore the Democratic Party's control over both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since 2022. As president, Lee will face challenges including navigating relations with the U.S. and China, investing in artificial intelligence, and addressing ongoing criminal cases against him. His focus will be on stabilizing the country after a period of political chaos.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily halted the garnishment of Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This pause follows a decision in April to resume collections on defaulted student loans, which began on May 5 through the Treasury Department's offset program. The Education Department stated that no Social Security payments have been offset due to student debt since the resumption of collections. The administration plans to proactively reach out to recipients to discuss affordable loan repayment options and help them regain good standing. The decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes.</p>

          <p>An inmate in Wisconsin has confessed to writing letters threatening President Donald Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant who was set to testify against him in a trial. According to court documents, the inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, aimed to have Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying in an assault case. Scott admitted to writing the letters and including Trump in the threat to ensure Secret Service involvement. Morales-Reyes was initially accused by the Department of Homeland Security of writing the threatening letters, but a handwriting test proved he was not the author.</p>

          <p>Financial experts caution that Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services can be detrimental to consumers if not used responsibly. While BNPL offers an easy way to spread out payments, it can lead to overspending, debt accumulation, and credit damage if users fail to make timely payments. The article emphasizes that BNPL is still debt, and consumers should approach it with caution, understanding the terms and potential consequences. Despite the risks, BNPL firms argue that their services offer a more affordable alternative to traditional credit cards, especially with soaring interest rates. The overall message is that consumers must exercise discipline and knowledge when using credit tools like BNPL to avoid financial pitfalls.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu next month after discontinuing them in 2016 due to kitchen efficiency issues. The return of snack wraps, featuring McCrispy Strips in spicy and ranch flavors, aims to boost sales amid recent declines attributed to cautious consumer spending. The move reflects McDonald's broader strategy to expand its chicken offerings, capitalizing on the growing popularity of chicken-based fast-food chains. The reintroduction of snack wraps could intensify competition in the fast-food industry, particularly in the chicken segment.</p>

          <p>A recent CDC study has found that Pepto Bismol, commonly used to prevent travelers' diarrhea, showed no significant difference compared to a placebo in preventing loose stool or diarrhea symptoms. The study, involving 270 participants traveling to Southeast Asia, south central Asia, North Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa, administered questionnaires before, during, and after their trips. While the study had limitations, including a smaller sample size than intended, it provides new data on the use of bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea prevention.

The key to AI longevity is increasing the number of "tokens" it can process, which determines its memory capacity. However, computing power remains a significant constraint, as AI models require high-end GPUs and TPUs that consume substantial energy and require cooling. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically feasible in the future, the environmental impact and cost are critical considerations. The ethical implications of continuous AI operation also warrant careful evaluation.</p>
