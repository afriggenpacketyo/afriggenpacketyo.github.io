          <p>An electric passenger plane successfully landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport, marking a significant milestone for electric aviation. The Beta Technologies aircraft, carrying four passengers, flew from East Hampton to JFK in just over half an hour. This flight demonstrates the practicality of electric air travel, which is quieter and cheaper to operate than traditional aircraft. The FAA has finalized new rules for pilot training and certification for air taxis, paving the way for electric aircraft to become a regular mode of transportation for short city trips.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have pledged $1 million in financial assistance to families of immigrants affected by recent immigration raids in the region. This commitment follows heated protests and calls for the organization to speak out against federal immigration enforcement. The Dodgers will collaborate with the City of Los Angeles and local community organizations to provide support, including food and mental health services. The pledge came after an incident where the Dodgers denied ICE agents access to their parking lots, a claim ICE disputed.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on Clayton Kershaw's near-perfect no-hitter game, highlighting the significance of errors in baseball and life. The author contrasts the pursuit of perfection with the acceptance of failure as an opportunity for growth and learning. Drawing parallels to Lou Gehrig's graceful response to his diagnosis with ALS, the piece emphasizes the importance of humility and courage in the face of adversity. The author notes that Kershaw's reaction to a teammate's error exemplified the acceptance of imperfections, defining ultimate success as embracing mistakes with a positive attitude.</p>

          <p>Medication abortion, involving pills like misoprostol and mifepristone, now constitutes 63% of all abortions in the U.S. The rise of self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain abortion pills without a prescription and take them without direct medical supervision, has sparked debate among clinicians. Studies indicate that self-managed abortion is a safe and effective method in the first trimester, supported by organizations like the World Health Organization. Telehealth has also expanded access, allowing doctors to prescribe pills across state lines, although legal challenges and political concerns persist.</p>
