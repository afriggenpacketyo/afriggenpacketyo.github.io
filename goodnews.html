          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has seen significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Diagnosed nearly a decade ago, Laycock's tremors and involuntary movements progressed despite medication. After undergoing DBS therapy, including a brain implant, Laycock transitioned to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), which fine-tunes stimulation in real-time. As a result, his tremors are now minimal, and his dyskinesia is well-controlled, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family, while encouraging others with Parkinson's to explore DBS as a treatment option.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple, Buseoksa Temple, returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to its Japanese owner, Kannonji Temple, after a protracted ownership dispute. The statue had been stolen from the Japanese temple in 2012, and while recovered, Buseoksa Temple claimed it was looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The South Korean temple showcased the statue for 100 days before its return. The case involved legal battles, with initial rulings favoring the South Korean temple overturned by higher courts, ultimately leading to the statue's return to Japan.</p>
