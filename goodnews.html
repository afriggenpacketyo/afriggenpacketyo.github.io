          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues China's WWII Commemorations Can Coexist with Appreciation for Modern Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 17:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that China's commemoration of its victory against Japanese aggression in World War II serves as a necessary historical reminder, not a tool to incite hatred. The author contrasts the solemn remembrance of wartime atrocities with the widespread appreciation for modern Japanese culture, such as anime and manga, which was prevalent during their own upbringing. The piece argues that condemning historical aggression is distinct from embracing contemporary Japan and its people. This dual perspective allows for both historical truth and present-day cultural exchange to coexist without contradiction.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the highly anticipated partnership of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu was defeated by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. The match, which ended 4-2, 4-2, highlighted the inexperience of Alcaraz and Raducanu as a doubles team, with Draper playing a particularly sharp and dominant match. Despite the loss, the event drew a large crowd, and Alcaraz produced a spectacular winner around the net post. Draper's successful return from a forearm injury was a significant positive, and his pairing with the accomplished doubles player Pegula proved to be a formidable combination.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose after the company maintained its full-year sales outlook, projecting 2.8% total sales growth, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The retailer reported adjusted earnings of $4.68 per share on $45.28 billion in revenue, marking the first time since 2014 it fell short on both metrics. Executives noted a continued "deferral mindset" among homeowners for large projects due to economic uncertainty. However, they also saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter, signaling potential momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit as a car manufacturer in Argentina, signaling a potential move to establish a production facility in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina SAU to manufacture and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, covering the entire EV supply chain. This development follows BYD's previous investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina and is part of its broader expansion strategy in Latin America. If realized, the factory would be BYD's second in the region, following its major project to build a large-scale production base in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new beverage options to attract customers and boost sales, particularly among younger consumers. The number of drink offerings at top chains has risen over 9% in the last year, with a focus on customized, cold, and high-protein beverages. This strategy comes as consumers increasingly visit establishments solely for a drink, shifting away from beverage purchases as mere add-ons to food. As companies compete for this market, they are launching innovative products like cereal-flavored lattes and protein-infused cold foam to capture the attention of Gen Z.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new, more powerful AI chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A, based on its advanced Blackwell architecture. The company confirmed it is evaluating various products to compete where government regulations permit. This move follows a deal in which Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their sales in China in exchange for permission to sell certain chips there. The Trump administration has expressed openness to allowing a scaled-down version of advanced chips to be sold in China, balancing national security concerns with commercial interests.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act.

This policy shift comes as the Trump administration explores ways to support domestic chip manufacturing while ensuring a return on public investment. Intel, which has been awarded nearly $8 billion from the law to build factories in the U.S., saw its stock climb following the news. (not investment advice)</p>
