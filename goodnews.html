          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 18:51:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that most of former President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful, dealing a potential blow to his efforts to unilaterally shape U.S. trade policy. The court found that the president overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, asserting that only Congress has the power to impose such tariffs. However, the ruling's implementation has been delayed until mid-October to allow the administration to appeal to the Supreme Court. This sets the stage for a major legal showdown over the scope of presidential power on trade matters.</p>

          <p>China is overhauling its national laboratory system to more directly serve its strategic goals in the global technology race, a shift exemplified by recent changes in Hong Kong. The new model moves away from loosely defined research, implementing clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's science supremacy agenda. During a ceremony in Hong Kong, Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun emphasized the city's role in supporting national development through innovation. This restructuring, affecting around 500 labs nationwide, aims to create focused research entities that function as efficient machines in the ongoing technological competition.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the controversy surrounding the original cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which depicted her on her knees at a man's feet. Speaking with "CBS Mornings," Carpenter dismissed the criticism, stating the provocative image was not a topic of concern among her inner circle. She explained her artistic intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it, particularly from a young woman's perspective. Amid the backlash, Carpenter released an alternative, more subdued album cover, but she maintains that the original art was about embracing mistakes and learning from them.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1 billion for Saturday night's drawing after no grand prize winner emerged from the previous round. This marks the sixth time in the game's history that the jackpot has reached such a monumental figure. The winner will have the choice between an estimated lump sum payment of $453.1 million or an annuity paid out over 30 years, both before taxes. No one has won the Powerball jackpot since May, and the odds of winning the top prize stand at a formidable 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive loss to Elena Rybakina in the US Open third round, British tennis player Emma Raducanu believes the world's top players are especially motivated to defeat her. All four of her Grand Slam defeats this year have been against elite opponents, including Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka. Raducanu feels these top-tier players have a "point to prove" against her and consistently elevate their game in their matchups. As she works with new coach Francisco Roig, Raducanu is focused on improving key areas like her serve and tactical readiness to close the gap with the sport's best.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The one-man protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which has a $213 million operating deficit. Kenyatta blames Republican inaction in the state legislature for the funding crisis, which has already led to service cuts affecting workers, students, and the elderly. He describes his walk as part of a "time honored American tradition of marching" to highlight the disparate priorities between politicians and the working people they represent.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, experienced significant stock gains this week, suggesting the financial benefits of the AI boom are expanding beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. These software and data management firms reported strong quarterly earnings and positive forecasts, driven by increased customer adoption related to AI services. This performance indicates that businesses are beginning to deploy AI in practical applications, easing investor concerns about whether AI would displace or benefit established software vendors. Executives noted that while enterprise-wide AI adoption is still in early stages, AI-native companies are driving substantial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges found that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to set aside a prior extension of TPS, as the governing statute is designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision provides temporary relief for TPS holders while the legal challenge against the administration's policy continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a successful August with a slight downturn, as the S&P 500 retreated from a record high on Friday, ending a four-week winning streak. Despite the weekly dip, the index gained over 2% for the month, marking its fourth consecutive monthly advance. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the decline. Inflation concerns also resurfaced as the Fed's preferred gauge, the core PCE price index, showed a rise to 2.9% year-over-year, its highest rate since February. (not investment advice)</p>

Fellow festival attendees, who happened to be an obstetrician, a NICU nurse, and a pediatrician, rushed to assist in the delivery.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but has significantly restricted their availability.

This includes people aged 65 and over and those with other underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable.

          <p>A California homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire has won a significant court victory, allowing him to probe State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. An administrative law judge denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to separate the inquiry into claims practices from the rate review. This ruling is a win for policyholders who have complained of payment delays and underpayments, arguing that no rate hike should be approved until these issues are addressed. The homeowner plans to investigate the insurer's methods for calculating personal property losses and reconstruction costs.</p>
