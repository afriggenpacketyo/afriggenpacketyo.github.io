The article also indicates that first-quarter bookings guidance fell slightly short of projections, but overall sentiment remains positive due to the anticipated 'Battlefield' reveal and ongoing game performance.

          <p>Restaurants across the country are increasingly featuring whole-leaf salads on their menus, prioritizing visual appeal, textural integrity, and effective dressing adhesion. Chefs note that whole leaves cradle breadcrumbs, seeds, herbs, and cheese more effectively, allowing for a more perfect bite. While some diners find whole-leaf salads inelegant and prefer chopped options, chefs argue that the trend is as practical as it is attractive. The article references the original Caesar salad, invented in Tijuana, Mexico, which also featured whole romaine hearts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction against President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums. Attorneys general from 21 states sued the president, arguing that the elimination of the IMLS violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The judge stated that the executive order disregarded the constitutional role of Congress in making laws and appropriating funds. The IMLS is the main source of federal funding for public libraries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that the ancient Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes likely used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," containing traces of DMT and tobacco at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found suggests that only select members of the Chav√≠n society participated in these rituals. The study provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of these gatherings.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he believes could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime but also highlights the ocean's capacity to recover. Attenborough's key message is that all is not lost and that countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans. The film emphasizes that a healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change.</p>
