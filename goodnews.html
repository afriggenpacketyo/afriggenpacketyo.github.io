          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age adults. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to improved mental well-being by affecting neurotransmitters. While acknowledging the need for more research, the findings point to potential public health benefits of the traditional diet for preventing depression.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was taken into custody peacefully at a residence in New Orleans following an extensive manhunt involving multiple state and federal law enforcement agencies. The May 16 escape, which officials called one of the worst in recent Louisiana history, has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a significant reward offered for his arrest.</p>

While fruit sandwiches are a long-standing snack in Japan, commonly found in convenience stores, this marks their first major introduction to UK supermarket shelves. The launch has sparked a conversation about the definition of a sandwich and the cultural crossover of culinary trends, popularized globally through social media.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Bafta-winning dark comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships with a bleakly humorous perspective. Sadler, the writer, says the series is influenced by their all-woman household upbringing and topical issues like the "bleak" modern dating scene. The comedy is known for tackling taboo subjects like mental health and abortion with an unflinching and satirical tone, which the creators feel they can push even further.</p>

Phages are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, offering a precise alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Using a special long-wavelength radar, the satellite can "see" through thick foliage and clouds to measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks. This technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, accurately estimate their role in mitigating climate change, and detect hidden deforestation. The first images have already revealed previously unseen details in remote areas like Indonesia's Halmahera rainforest, aiding in conservation efforts.</p>

The judge ruled the order unconstitutional, calling it an attack on the firm's First and Fifth Amendment rights and a threat to the legal system's independence. This ruling is the latest in a series of defeats for the administration's campaign to use executive power against law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total from $330 million to $750 million. This move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial incentives. Industry unions have warned that California was losing its status as the heart of entertainment, citing significant job losses and a record decline in Los Angeles-based production. The expanded credit is seen as a crucial step to bring productions back to California. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants and deportees. The show opened with a haunting scene of models with shaved heads and hands tied, kneeling in a formation reminiscent of images from high-security prisons in El Salvador used to detain migrants. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the show aimed to critique the "dehumanization" of immigrants in the United States. The performance, set to "California Dreamin'," received widespread praise online for its bold political message.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), designed to study atmospheric data by sampling gasses and measuring land and water surfaces. Officials advise the public not to be alarmed by the aircraft performing peculiar maneuvers like vertical spirals.</p>
