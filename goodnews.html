          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprising pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly beating Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell's impressive performance marked his first pole since June and Mercedes' first in Singapore since 2018. The qualifying session was tense, with Verstappen attributing his second-place finish to being impeded by McLaren's Lando Norris on his final lap. McLaren's championship leader Oscar Piastri qualified third, positioning himself ahead of his main rival and teammate Norris for the race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 reaching its 29th record high of the year despite an ongoing federal government shutdown. Analysts and investors appear to view the shutdown as a temporary non-event for the market, focusing instead on positive corporate earnings and sector-specific news. The healthcare and technology sectors performed particularly well, boosted by a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs and continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Investment commentary within the article suggests a bullish outlook on specific stocks like Nike and Boeing following recent developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's national rugby team, the Springboks, won their second consecutive Rugby Championship title by defeating Argentina 29-27 in a decisive match. The victory was secured after New Zealand's earlier win over Australia set the stage for South Africa to claim the championship with any form of win. Despite a strong start from Argentina, the world champion Springboks demonstrated their dominance in the second half. The match, played in London to a large crowd, concluded a successful tournament for South Africa, which recovered from early losses to win their final three games.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat with green olives and pimentos, has largely vanished from American stores after peaking in popularity from the 1940s to the 1970s. Initially valued for its affordability and visual appeal compared to bologna, its decline began as consumer preferences shifted towards healthier, less-processed foods. Growing concerns about sodium and preservatives, combined with the rise of the low-fat craze and microwaveable meals, pushed olive loaf into obscurity. While it holds a nostalgic place for some, experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a major rebranding to appeal to modern tastes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. They argue that a strong "home bias" has left many American investors over-concentrated in domestic assets, potentially missing out on better value and growth opportunities abroad. Emerging markets, particularly countries like India, are highlighted as having strong long-term potential due to favorable demographics and rapid economic growth. The analysis suggests that looking beyond the U.S. could be a prudent strategy for long-term portfolio growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key components of a Gaza ceasefire and peace proposal outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, both President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have signaled readiness to move forward, with Israel preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. While U.S. officials view the response as positive, Hamas indicated that other parts of the deal require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. This development represents a significant, though tentative, step towards de-escalating the long-running conflict.</p>

The event, which celebrates peace, unity, and gratitude to their god, Waaqa, was held under increased security. The festival has been revived and grown in prominence since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo heritage, came to power. However, despite the celebratory atmosphere, some Oromos express criticism that Abiy's administration has not fully addressed their long-standing demands for justice and cultural recognition, highlighting underlying political tensions.</p>

The government has agreed to the protesters' demands, prompting the alliance leader to ask demonstrators to disperse. The breakthrough came after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent a delegation to negotiate, stating that public interest and peace are top priorities.</p>

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early.

These emails serve as a digital time capsule, capturing birthdays, small memories, funny quotes, and even reflections during difficult parenting moments. The expert suggests this practice is a powerful way to build a legacy of love and connection that the children can access when they are older.

In a film accompanying her album release, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," finding it flattering that someone would devote so much attention to her.

          <p>Urenco's facility in New Mexico, the only commercial uranium enrichment plant in the U.S., is expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This demand is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports that is creating a significant supply gap. While the plant is increasing production by 15%, industry leaders warn that the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, from mining to conversion, needs to expand to support ambitious government and tech sector goals for new reactor construction.
