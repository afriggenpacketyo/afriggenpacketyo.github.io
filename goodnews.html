          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to address critical issues such as trade disputes, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and NATO defense spending. Merz aims to establish a collaborative relationship with the U.S. while ensuring Germany is not perceived as a laggard in defense contributions, especially since Trump has frequently criticized Germany's trade practices and defense spending. Merz will likely emphasize Germany's support for Ukraine and the need for European involvement in peace negotiations, along with advocating for a zero-for-zero tariff deal between the U.S. and the EU. He will also seek to negotiate sector-specific tariffs that significantly impact the German economy. The meeting follows phone calls between the leaders, aiming to build on their rapport.</p>

          <p>The English government announced that from September 2026, any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals, regardless of their income, potentially saving parents ¬£500 a year. This change is projected to make an additional 500,000 pupils eligible and lift 100,000 children out of poverty, costing the Department of Education ¬£1 billion up to 2029. While largely welcomed, some critics argue that other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty, and that the actual number of children lifted out of poverty may be less than claimed. The government also pledged ¬£13m to food charities and will review school meal standards to ensure they are healthy, although there are no plans to introduce automatic enrolment for eligible children.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers report that filings typically peak in late summer and early spring, with slower periods around the winter holidays and summer vacations. A University of Washington study supports this, citing a "domestic ritual" calendar influencing couples to delay separation until after these symbolically charged times. While some experts believe sentimental reasons drive this pattern, others suggest it relates to tax filings or the end of summer family vacations. However, overall divorce rates in the U.S. have been declining, with a notable increase in divorces among people over 50, often driven by women seeking financial independence.</p>

          <p>During a New York City mayoral debate, Democratic candidates sparred over defunding the police and combating President Trump's immigration policies. Candidates like Andrew Cuomo faced accusations of previously supporting defunding the police, while others proposed increasing mental health outreach workers instead. Discussions also addressed rising crime and shoplifting, with some suggesting a guaranteed median income as a solution. Regarding immigration, candidates largely defended New York City's sanctuary status and vowed to limit police cooperation with ICE, with some promising to warn migrants about federal immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <h2>Weight-Loss Jabs May Affect Contraception, Women Warned</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 03:07:49 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, MHRA, has warned women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less effective, especially in overweight or obese women, due to common side effects like vomiting and diarrhoea. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, ranging from one to two months. This advice aims to ensure women are aware of the potential impact on contraception and take necessary precautions.</p>

          <p>Water shows at the World Exposition in Osaka have been suspended until Friday after high levels of legionella bacteria were detected in seawater at the venue. Tests revealed that the level of legionella in water from the Water Plaza was 20 times higher than the allowable limit, leading to the cancellation of shows. Expo organizers are implementing measures to improve water quality, including sanitization, pipe cleaning, and increased circulation of seawater. The resumption of shows depends on the results of these measures.</p>

          <p>Analysts provide predictions for the 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers, highlighting key factors for each team's success. The Thunder are favored due to their dominant defense, MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and deep roster, while the Pacers need sensational performances from Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam and to maintain their pace. Experts debate the coaching advantage and identify unheralded players to watch, ultimately predicting the Thunder to win in five or six games, though one analyst picks the Pacers in seven.
