        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed at a fresh record high, gaining 1.15% on Thursday, propelled by strong performances in real estate and technology sectors. This occurred amidst mixed trading across other Asia-Pacific markets, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated 25-basis-point interest rate cut, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell described as a "risk management" measure. The Fed also signaled two more potential reductions this year and one in 2026. Concurrently, the Bank of Japan began its two-day policy meeting, with most economists expecting rates to remain unchanged, while Australian gas producer Santos experienced an over 11% decline after an $18.7 billion acquisition bid was terminated.

          <p>European stocks opened higher on Thursday, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up 0.5%, as traders assessed the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in an 11-to-1 vote, positioning the overnight funds rate between 4.00%-4.25%. Despite investor hopes for a longer cutting path, Fed Chair Jerome Powell termed it a "risk management" move. European banking stocks, including Santander and Deutsche Bank, saw gains, while Novo Nordisk also rose after trials showed its Wegovy obesity pill led to significant weight loss. The Bank of England is expected to keep its rates on hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment during President Trump's state visit, projected to create 7,600 jobs across various sectors. Key pledges include £90 billion from Blackstone over a decade, £22 billion from Microsoft over four years, and £5 billion from Google for data center expansion. This significant influx arrives after recent setbacks, with major pharmaceutical companies like Merck and AstraZeneca having scaled back or redirected their UK investments to the US. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised these commitments as a strong signal of Britain's economic appeal, aiming to foster growth in clean energy, biotech, and AI.</p>

Nscale, which emerged from a cryptocurrency infrastructure firm, is strategically addressing Europe's lack of sufficient computing capacity and fragmented market.

The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, with the Atlas 950 supernode supporting 8,192 Ascend chips and the full supercluster utilizing over 500,000 chips. A more advanced Atlas 960 version, slated for 2027, would boast over 1 million chips. This initiative highlights China's push for self-reliance in AI computing amidst U.S. sanctions, with Huawei claiming its new systems will offer the world's most powerful computing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced late-stage trial results showing its once-daily oral semaglutide pill, dubbed the "Wegovy pill," achieved "significant" weight reduction and good tolerability. The pill led to an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and comorbidities, comparable to its injectable Wegovy. The oral treatment, currently under FDA review, aims to offer patients an alternative to injections as competition intensifies in the oral GLP-1 market. Eli Lilly's rival pill, Orforglipron, showed 12.4% weight loss, with analysts suggesting it could be fast-tracked for approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea forward Cole Palmer asserted the team does not perceive their Champions League campaign as merely a "learning curve," despite their recent 3-1 defeat to an experienced Bayern Munich. While manager Enzo Maresca suggested the young squad could "learn a lot from" the loss and "build something special," the match underscored Chelsea's relative inexperience at this elite level. Defensive errors proved costly against ruthless opposition, with former player Pat Nevin highlighting the substantial "jump" required for Champions League success. Chelsea fielded their third-youngest team ever in the competition, indicating a lack of seasoned players compared to their opponents.</p>

This emphatic win helped the Dodgers maintain their two-game lead in the National League West standings. Snell's stellar outing provided a vital confidence boost for the team, especially given their bullpen's recent struggles, proving how a surging rotation can ease pressure.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Gabrielle will largely remain over open waters for several days, but it is projected to intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the upcoming weekend. Its current forecast track suggests it will pass north of the Caribbean, potentially reaching Bermuda next week with maximum sustained winds of up to 85 mph. The National Hurricane Center noted the storm's path remains "highly uncertain" due to its poorly defined center. Despite initial NOAA predictions for an unusually active season, hurricane activity has been quieter than expected so far this year.</p>

Harris wrote that Buttigieg "would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man," acknowledging the significant political risk.

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts predict China's central bank will likely engage in moderate easing, even as the Fed's move creates more room for looser monetary policy. The Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to the 4-4.25% range. This action led to an overnight strengthening of the offshore yuan, reaching a high of 7.086 per US dollar. Economists forecast a smaller rate cut from the People's Bank of China this year, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan, providing support for the currency.

NASA announced the issue was resolved, clarifying that an early warning system initiated the shutdowns due to a conservative safeguard in the software settings, rather than an actual malfunction. The Cygnus XL, carrying over 11,000 pounds of vital equipment and supplies, marks the maiden flight of an upgraded, longer version designed to deliver significantly more cargo per mission. Astronaut Jonny Kim, with support from Zena Cardman, will use the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm to capture the spacecraft.</p>
