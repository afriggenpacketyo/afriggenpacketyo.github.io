          <p>A social media post displaying McDonald's prices from 1991 has generated significant discussion among millennials on Reddit, sparking nostalgia for cheaper fast food. The graphic showed items like a 79-cent cheeseburger and a $1.85 Big Mac, leading to debates about both the cost and perceived quality of the food compared to today. While many fondly recalled the lower prices, others argued that when adjusted for inflation, the costs are comparable to modern prices, especially when using the company's app for deals. The discussion highlights generational perspectives on economic changes and consumer value.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submission of both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-flu shot. The company plans to file for approval for both products later this year, with potential market availability in 2026.

          <p>Fast-food chain Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in annual U.S. sales, becoming the nation's third-largest chicken chain behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its simple, focused menu of chicken fingers and its strategy of operating company-owned restaurants rather than franchising, ensuring quality control. With system sales reaching $5.1 billion last year and rapid expansion underway, the 28-year-old brand has seen remarkable growth. Founder Todd Graves aims for the chain to become a top 10 restaurant brand with over $10 billion in annual sales.</p>

          <p>Canada and the United States are set to resume trade talks after the Canadian government rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms. The tax, which was scheduled to take effect Monday, had been called a "direct and blatant attack" by President Trump, who suspended negotiations in response. Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, Canada announced it would drop the tax in anticipation of a broader trade deal. This move is seen as a concession to restart discussions on easing a range of steep tariffs imposed by the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted by Chinese researchers has linked age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, to a protein deficiency in the inner ear. The research, published in Nature Aging, provides a detailed molecular map of the aging patterns in primate cochleae at a single-cell level. Significantly, the scientists found that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of this hearing loss in monkeys. These findings offer a new understanding of the condition and suggest a potential pathway for developing personalized treatments to combat age-related hearing decline in humans.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a restrictive new outdoor smoking ban, prohibiting smoking in public parks, beaches, swimming pools, and near schools. The law is part of a broader government effort to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aims to protect children from exposure to smoke. While the measure has significant public support, some citizens view it as an excessive infringement on personal freedom in a country where caf√© and cigarette culture is deeply ingrained. The ban does not currently apply to e-cigarettes, a point of criticism for some health advocates.</p>

          <p>Scottish scrum-half Ben White has received a surprise call-up to the prestigious British and Irish Lions rugby squad as an injury replacement. The 27-year-old was preparing to play for Scotland in New Zealand when he got the call from Lions head coach Andy Farrell, following an injury to Welsh player Tomos Williams. White described the news as an "incredible honour" and immediately departed to join the Lions tour in Australia. His selection brings Scotland's representation in the elite touring squad back up to eight players.</p>
