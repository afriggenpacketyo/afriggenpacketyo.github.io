          <p>The United States government has lifted export controls on certain chip design software being sold to China, according to major developers Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies were informed by the Commerce Department that special approval is no longer required for their products. This policy change signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology-related tensions and trade disputes between the two global economic powers, allowing for the restoration of access for China-based clients.</p>

          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring 14 of the 15 people aboard. The pilot reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport and crashing in a wooded area. Officials noted that despite some critical injuries, it was remarkable there were no fatalities, crediting a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport for the effective and swift emergency response.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has experienced a dramatic revival, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year. This strong rebound is primarily driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, spurred by supportive policies from Beijing and a slowdown in mainland A-share listings. Factors like delisting fears in the U.S. and strong mainland investor inflows have positioned the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy can increase breast cancer risk in women under 55. In contrast, the research found that using estrogen alone, a treatment typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, was associated with a reduced risk. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of hormone replacement therapy, highlighting that the specific type of treatment is a crucial factor in its safety profile.</p>
