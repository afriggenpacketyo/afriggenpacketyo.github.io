        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) saw significant budget cuts, saving an estimated $175 billion, but fell short of the initial $2 trillion goal due to legal challenges and the need for congressional approval. Richard Stern from the Heritage Foundation noted that DOGE overestimated its legal flexibility. While direct spending cuts were limited, DOGE's efforts in information gathering and whistleblower aspects could have a lasting impact by identifying potential spending cuts for Congress to consider. The White House is sending a $9.4B DOGE cuts package to Congress next week. </p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is known for his pessimistic economic predictions, even as his bank achieves record profits. Despite his warnings of economic storms and geopolitical turmoil, JPMorgan has consistently outperformed its rivals, generating seven record annual profits from 2015 to 2024. Some analysts suggest Dimon's caution serves to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency. JPMorgan's strong performance is attributed to its ability to navigate higher interest rates and its investments in technology, including artificial intelligence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A $200,000 annuity can provide reliable monthly income, often between about $1,100 and $2,100, depending on your age, gender and contract terms. This type of annuity may be worth it if you want peace of mind and are worried about longevity risk, but not if you need liquidity or have legacy goals. It is designed to complement existing benefits like Social Security, a pension or retirement account withdrawals (not investment advice). Before committing, consider your other income sources, your need for liquidity and whether you're comfortable locking up a large chunk of cash.</p>

Adams said the BBC "upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland" and that it "was out of sync" with the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 peace deal that formally ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</p>
