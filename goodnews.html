          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region demonstrated a mixed reaction to the U.S. government shutdown, with investors appearing largely unfazed. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 continued its losing streak, while business sentiment among large manufacturers saw a slight increase according to the Tankan survey. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi and Taiwan's Weighted Index posted gains, partly driven by strong performance in the tech sector. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a public holiday, and spot gold prices reached a new record high during trading hours.</p>

          <p>New Zealand all-rounder Melie Kerr expressed strong confidence in her team's future, stating they can remain competitive in major tournaments for the next decade. The White Ferns enter the 50-over World Cup as surprise T20 World Cup champions from 2024, a victory that broke a previous losing streak. Despite their recent T20 success, the team is not considered a favorite for the upcoming tournament, a status Kerr believes they can use to their advantage. Head coach Ben Sawyer acknowledges other teams as favorites but maintains that New Zealand is capable of defeating any opponent on their day.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations as the institution evaluates the effects of previous rate cuts. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that while inflation has moderated, global trade uncertainties could slow growth in the latter half of the financial year. The central bank is taking a cautious approach, allowing time for a significant 50-basis-point cut from June to fully impact the economy. The RBI forecasts economic growth of 6.8% for fiscal year 2026, though projections have been slightly lowered due to trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced its intention to convert its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) into a full secondary listing on a U.S. stock exchange. This move is designed to attract a wider range of global investors and improve access to New York's deeper capital pools, while the company will maintain its primary listing, headquarters, and tax residency in the U.K. The decision follows a series of high-profile companies, including BHP and Flutter, shifting their primary listings away from the London Stock Exchange. While AstraZeneca frames the move as an expansion, it fuels ongoing concerns about London's ability to retain major multinational corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>England Implements Ban on 'Buy One, Get One Free' Promotions for Unhealthy Foods</h2>

          <p>Starting Wednesday, retailers in England are prohibited from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, on food and drink products classified as unhealthy. The new restrictions, which apply to supermarkets and other large retailers, are part of a government effort to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. The measure had been delayed due to cost-of-living concerns, but ministers have proceeded, arguing its importance for public health. Public health advocates support the move, stating that such promotions often encourage consumers to spend more money and make impulsive, unhealthy purchases.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant infrastructure milestone, with its total network of subsea pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. This was marked by the recent installation of a final pipeline section in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expanding network is a key part of China's strategy to enhance its energy security by tapping into offshore resources. Officials plan to extend the network to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030, with new pipelines designed to transport greener fuels like hydrogen in the future.</p>

          <p>Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's first year as NATO's Secretary General has been largely defined by his efforts to manage the alliance's relationship with a re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump. Assuming the role on October 1, 2024, Rutte quickly focused on reaffirming the U.S. commitment to NATO amid Trump's threats to withdraw support from members not meeting defense spending targets. Foreign policy experts have offered varied assessments of his performance, generally grading him favorably for navigating internal tensions and securing continued U.S. engagement. However, challenges remain as he must now lead the alliance in confronting increasing external pressures, including Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>The UK government has mandated that every General Practitioner (GP) practice in England must provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. This initiative aims to eliminate the '8am scramble' where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines. In addition to booking non-urgent appointments, the online systems will allow patients to describe symptoms and request callbacks. Despite some concerns from the British Medical Association about potential risks, ministers have implemented the plan, citing significant financial investment to support the transition to a more digital healthcare service.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of their wild-card series, powered by a formidable offensive performance. The team matched a franchise postseason record with five home runs, including two each from stars Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong seven-inning outing, striking out nine batters while allowing only two runs. Although the Dodgers' bullpen showed some weakness by allowing three runs in the eighth inning, the team's dominant start puts them just one win away from advancing to the next round.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional white-collar paths. This trend is driven by concerns over high college tuition and student loan debt, as well as the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating entry-level office jobs. A recent survey found that 77% of Gen Z members prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate, viewing trades as more secure than fields like software development or accounting. This shift is helping to reduce the stigma once associated with blue-collar work, with many now seeing it as a viable path to entrepreneurship and financial independence.</p>
