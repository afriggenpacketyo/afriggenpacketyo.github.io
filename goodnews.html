          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to train an AI model without proper consent, after initially contracting them for work described for internal or academic use only. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims regarding their voices as a unique entity, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the training data will proceed. The case highlights the growing legal challenges AI companies face regarding the use of creative work for training their systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their international presence to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their operations abroad. As these corporations move into global markets, they show a strong preference for legal support from domestic firms, citing greater trust and understanding. This expansion is also encouraged by Beijing as a way to support its national enterprises. However, these law firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amidst rising geopolitical tensions. The number of Chinese legal offices overseas has seen a substantial 70% increase since 2018, marking a pivotal moment for the country's legal services sector.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Halts Indiscriminate Immigration Stops in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:36:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order to stop the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting claims that agents violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The order also mandates that officials provide detainees at a specific Los Angeles facility with access to legal counsel, a right lawyers claimed was being denied. This decision represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of his team, in a significant talent acquisition move. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, includes licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology and compensation for the new hires, though Google is not taking an equity stake in the company. This allows Windsurf to continue operating independently and license its technology to others. The agreement underscores the intense competition for top AI talent among major tech firms, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta making substantial investments to secure leading researchers and developers in the field.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of local pharmaceutical companies are preparing to enter the market. There are currently around 60 similar drugs under trial in China, aiming to compete in the lucrative global weight-loss market, which is estimated to be worth $150 billion. The introduction of generic versions of the drug is expected to significantly lower prices and increase accessibility for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers will compete for market share in China, driving down costs for consumers who currently face high monthly expenses for the treatment.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project for one of its major terminals, despite a recent slowdown in port activity attributed to rising tariffs and global trade tensions. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of new land and extend the quay to accommodate larger ships, aiming to boost cargo capacity by 50%. Officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in the shipping industry but express confidence in the long-term demand for increased capacity. The move is seen as a strategic investment to strengthen the U.S. supply chain, even as both the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles report recent declines in container volume.</p>

          <p>Lord Huron's 2015 song "The Night We Met" has become a massive sleeper hit, accumulating over three billion Spotify streams a decade after its release, surpassing many contemporary pop hits. The track's slow-burning success began after it was featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 and was further amplified by its widespread use on TikTok. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship, allowing listeners to connect with it personally. Despite being a non-traditional hit, its immense popularity has brought new attention to the indie folk band without defining them as a one-hit wonder, as they continue to build on an already established fanbase.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has ordered the release of Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, who was detained after a video showed him being beaten by federal agents. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades, will be released on a $3,000 bond after spending 20 days in custody. His arrest in Orange County drew significant attention after footage of the incident went viral. His family expressed relief and plans to seek immediate medical care for him upon his release, as they are concerned about injuries he sustained during the arrest, including a possible concussion. Barranco had previously applied for parole-in-place, a status available to certain relatives of U.S. military members.</p>

The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the need to work with, rather than against, the natural world. This philosophy underpins the King's long-standing advocacy for environmentalism, sustainable farming, and traditional crafts. A source close to the King described this worldview as a crucial part of his legacy, aiming to unite his diverse interests into a cohesive call for a more sustainable future. The summit emphasized learning from Indigenous wisdom to address modern environmental crises.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a first-time champion as world number one Iga Swiatek faces off against American Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam winner, has historically found grass to be her most challenging surface, but has found formidable form during the tournament. Anisimova, a former teenage prodigy, is reaching her potential after taking a break from tennis for her mental health, playing with an aggressive, nothing-to-lose style. While Swiatek has the edge in major finals experience, Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely. The match will be their first meeting at the tour level, promising a compelling contest of contrasting pressures and styles.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," seeking to navigate the growing tensions between the United States and China by prioritizing national sovereignty. In a recent speech, he invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, who turned to the U.S. for security while insisting on an independent Australian posture. While reaffirming the importance of the U.S. alliance and the AUKUS security pact, Albanese's government is signaling a recalibration of its international relationships. This approach aims to balance its security commitments with its economic interests, asserting that Australia will shape its own future rather than simply aligning with a great power.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprise-released "Swag," his first new album since 2021, prompting a resurgence of his dedicated fanbase. The 21-track project sees a return to his R&B-infused style and directly addresses the intense public scrutiny he and his wife, Hailey Bieber, have faced, including persistent divorce rumors. On tracks like "Walking Away," he reaffirms his commitment to his marriage, while other songs celebrate his wife's success and their journey into parenthood. The album also incorporates viral moments from his recent paparazzi encounters, turning his much-memed use of vernacular into a self-aware commentary on the pressures of fame and the public's perception of his mental health.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old from Brookline, Massachusetts, who is autistic and non-speaking, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For the first 14 years of his life, Viraj was unable to communicate effectively due to apraxia, a neurological disorder affecting motor skills. His father, Sumit Dhanda, discovered that Viraj could type with his thumb, unlocking his son's hidden intelligence. In just three years, Viraj progressed from basic math to calculus, scored a 35 on the ACT, and graduated from high school. Viraj hopes his achievement serves as a breakthrough for the entire non-speaking autistic community, demonstrating that profound intelligence can exist behind communication barriers.</p>
