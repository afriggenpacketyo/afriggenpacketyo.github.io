        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed a mixed performance on Monday as investors digested China's decision to keep its key loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, a move consistent with Reuters polls. This stability in China's lending policy follows a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, influencing global financial sentiment. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index saw a decline, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi indexes registered gains, reflecting diverse regional responses to economic cues. The one-year LPR, affecting most new loans, and the five-year LPR, impacting mortgages, both remained at their current levels, indicating Beijing's calibrated approach to monetary policy amidst broader market dynamics.

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs clinched their inaugural win of the season, defeating the New York Giants 22-9 after overcoming a notably sloppy start and a stagnant first-half performance. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes eventually found his rhythm, making key connections with Tyquan Thornton for a touchdown and setting up another score, turning the tide in the second half. Despite visible frustrations from star tight end Travis Kelce earlier in the game, the Chiefs' defense maintained strong pressure, effectively limiting Giants quarterback Russell Wilson's impact. This hard-fought victory improves Kansas City's record to 1-2, providing crucial momentum, while the Giants fall to 0-3.</p>

          <p>China's central bank opted to hold its benchmark loan prime rates (LPR) steady for the fourth consecutive month, a decision that aligned with economists' expectations to defer major stimulus measures, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Both the one-year LPR, which influences most new and outstanding loans, and the five-year LPR, affecting mortgages, remained at their current levels. This stability in monetary policy comes amidst a backdrop of various economic indicators signaling a continued slowdown in China's economy, including weaker retail sales, industrial output growth, and persistent deflation. The country is grappling with sluggish domestic demand and a worsening real estate slump, particularly impacting its third-quarter growth momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

These crucial practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and building authentic confidence by empowering children to try new things and sometimes fail. Furthermore, effective parents prioritize teaching conflict resolution, validating their child's emotions, helping them recognize subtle social cues, and resisting the urge to immediately solve every conflict for them. Treating mistakes as valuable learning opportunities and consistently listening more than lecturing are also identified as vital, collectively laying a robust foundation for resilient, empathetic, and socially intelligent adults capable of forming healthy relationships.</p>
