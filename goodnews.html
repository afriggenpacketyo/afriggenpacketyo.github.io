          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist has stated that the recent monetary policy cycle to control inflation is now complete, having successfully lowered the rate from its peak. He cautioned that the bank must stay prepared for new economic shocks and potential future deviations from its 2% target. While the primary objective is considered achieved, other officials noted that risks to growth and inflation are now tilted downwards, suggesting any future rate adjustments would likely be cuts.

          <p>Panelists at a CNBC conference argued that emerging economies should develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures, rather than relying on English-based models. They highlighted the use of open-source AI models and democratized access to cloud computing as key strategies for nations to build their own AI infrastructure. This approach allows countries to harness local talent and create a collective energy for innovation, preventing the benefits of the rapidly growing AI market from being concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

          <p>Amid an anti-dumping investigation by Beijing into European brandy, China has reportedly offered a significant tax refund to major French cognac makers, including Hennessy and Martell. According to a source, the offer is conditional on producers agreeing to a minimum selling price and committing to fair trade practices. This move comes as a July 5 deadline approaches, after which temporary tariffs of up to 39 percent could become permanent if no agreement is reached in the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a "landmark" review of the entire parental leave and pay system, aiming to modernize policies for maternity, paternity, and shared leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds described the current system as confusing and unsupportive compared to other countries, noting low take-up rates for paternity and shared leave. Campaigners have praised the review as a generational opportunity to improve a system they say has been long overlooked, though some critics worry about potential costs for employers.</p>

The study highlights the significant potential for this method to provide a standardized, high-precision approach to global carbon accounting, which is currently lacking. Researchers state this technology could also be applied to monitor emissions from other major sources like oil and gas fields or steel plants, enabling better tracking of pollution.</p>

The author notes that recent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon are finally beginning to address these topics, telling stories from the perspective of the colonized. Despite facing limited distribution and media coverage, these films are finding success with audiences, suggesting a public readiness to engage with a history long overlooked by the nation's film industry.</p>

Goldman Sachs predicts the yuan will appreciate further, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar level within six months, driven by resilient Chinese macro data and waning confidence in US economic exceptionalism.

The expansion was supported by increased production, though new export orders declined and employment remained weak amid fierce price competition, painting a mixed picture of the health of China's manufacturing sector.
