          <p>Chinese biotechnology companies are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical firms to develop innovative medicines. These deals often utilize a newco structure, combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through newly established corporate entities. This trend is driven by the need for Chinese biotech firms to raise funds as an alternative to selling shares amidst depressed valuations, with both the number and value of deals exceeding those of the previous year. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group is currently in talks for potential licensing deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The agreement follows technical talks between the two nations, with China expected to issue a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese processing facilities. Japan will continue to push for the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. While Japanese fishermen and businesses welcomed the announcement, some concerns remain regarding ongoing restrictions. The optimism score is not applicable to this article.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dismissed its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for the crypto industry, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the industry. Binance is the world's largest digital assets exchange by volume. (not investment advice)</p>
