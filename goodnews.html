The leaders carried their message through downtown, uniting in song and prayer, and left flowers on the steps of the Federal Building in tribute to those who have been detained.

          <p>The reboot of "28 Years Later" presents a divisive yet intriguing commentary on human progress, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. The film picks up nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, focusing on a community on Lindisfarne, an island cut off from the world. Spike's storyline is a coming-of-age journey spliced with historical footage and Kipling's poetry. The film suggests that humankind's natural state is struggle and division, with the infected splitting into sub-species and raises questions about who the real savages are: the infected or us?</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced shoreline litter. Researchers analyzed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with bag policies compared to those without. Fees on plastic bags appear to be more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter. The findings offer insights into the effectiveness of plastic bag regulations in curbing plastic pollution.</p>

The Mexican actor noted that Hollywood productions were not sending messages that he could be himself in projects where he could see himself reflected in the roles. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation in Hollywood, where they remain underrepresented in lead or co-lead roles. He recalls being asked to "clean up" his accent early in his career, a request that is no longer part of the conversation.</p>

While Pixar executives remain committed to telling original stories, the studio is balancing new content with sequels to maintain its pipeline.

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for a further 90 days, setting a new deadline of September 17. The video-sharing app has faced questions over its future after the US passed a law last year requiring the app to be banned unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. Trump signed an executive order delaying the date for enforcing the law for a third time. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's leadership and support in keeping the app online for its 170m US users.</p>
