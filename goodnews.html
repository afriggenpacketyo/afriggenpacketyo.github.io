          <h2>Scottish Government Abandons Plans for Misogyny Law Before Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:06:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to drop its plans to introduce a new misogyny law before the upcoming Holyrood election next year, citing insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, ministers intend to amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. The government also retracted plans to legislate against conversion therapy, hoping for a UK-wide solution, though it may introduce its own law if it remains in power after the election. The decision follows an expert group's recommendation in 2022 for separate legislation to address misogyny.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal, granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russia. This agreement arrives as the U.S. seeks to diversify its access to rare earth minerals, vital for manufacturing high-tech and military equipment, amid escalating trade disputes with China. The deal encompasses a wide range of minerals, including rare earth elements, oil, and natural gas, with the U.S. offering financial or military assistance in return for a share of royalties from future projects. Ukraine holds approximately 5% of global mineral reserves.</p>

          <p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is prioritizing the protection of President Trump‚Äôs Senate majority in the 2026 midterms, contrasting with the DNC's strategy of primarying older Democrats. The NRSC is backing specific candidates, Mike Rogers in Michigan and John Cornyn in Texas, discouraging donors from supporting potential primary challengers. This decision has sparked debate, with some arguing that it undermines the voters' right to choose their candidates. The DNC responded by criticizing Republicans for attempting to control House races, suggesting it stems from fear of losing seats due to their unpopular agenda.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook is set to make his England debut after being included in the squad for the upcoming one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. Cook's selection comes amidst injuries to several key players, providing him with an opportunity in a relatively inexperienced pace attack. The article notes that England will begin a defining year of Test cricket with a fresh-looking pace attack, with Cook and Josh Tongue potentially forming part of the starting XI. The likely combination of Atkinson, Tongue, and Cook would have a combined 13 caps, marking England's fewest in the pace attack at home since Zimbabwe's last Test in the country 22 years ago.</p>

This comes as a U.S. executive order to close a multibillion-dollar tariff loophole, known as ‚Äúde minimis‚Äù, came into effect, primarily affecting Chinese exporters.</p>

The lynx has been moved to an enclosure in Germany's Black Forest to assess its survival skills and human interaction tendencies. While thousands of lynx roam wild in European forests, efforts are underway to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity. The key concern is the lynx's potential for seeking human interaction, which could lead to conflicts in populated areas.</p>
