          <p>Financial experts are observing a shift away from passive investment strategies, such as buying S&P 500 ETFs like VOO, as investors seek greater diversification. Critics note that the S&P 500 has become imbalanced, with the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. Consequently, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500 and hitting an all-time high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that one of the most effective financial strategies for the average person is not picking stocks but buying household consumables in bulk. He argues that saving a significant percentage on items like toothpaste and toilet paper by purchasing them at a discount provides a guaranteed return, unlike the inherent risks of the stock market. Cuban emphasizes that this practical approach to saving money can be a superior investment, provided that the purchases are made with cash and not by accumulating credit card debt.</p>

Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in a century, native plants are blooming, and wildlife is returning to the waterway. To celebrate this milestone, a group of Indigenous youth became the first to kayak the full length of the river in over 100 years, highlighting the cultural and environmental significance of its restoration.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached record highs this week, driven by cooler-than-expected inflation data and a strong corporate earnings season. The September Consumer Price Index report showed a smaller increase than anticipated, fueling expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again. Despite the ongoing government shutdown, the market was buoyed by impressive quarterly results, with 87% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, significantly above the historical average.

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, holds a significant place in U.S. history and is also known for its reported hauntings. Completed in 1801, the building temporarily served as the White House for President James Madison after the original was burned by the British in 1814, and it was where he signed the treaty ending the War of 1812. Now a museum, the house has a storied past that includes tales of paranormal activity, such as unexplained noises and the scent of lilacs associated with Dolley Madison.</p>

This narrative reinforces Xi's central authority within the Communist Party, portraying the plan as a product of his extensive domestic tours and fact-finding investigations throughout the year, which was then deliberated at the party's fourth plenum.</p>

While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign, asserting that her warnings about Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct and criticizing businesses for capitulating to his demands. Despite polls showing limited support for another campaign, even in her home state of California, Harris did not rule out the possibility, stating she still sees a future for herself in public service.</p>

Central to their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, which develops young players from the binational San Diego-Tijuana region, reflecting the community's unique cross-border identity.</p>

Described as an "underwater phantom," the small, transparent drone mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish, allowing for near-silent operation with low power consumption. Its creators suggest the robot is ideally suited for tasks such as covert deep-sea monitoring, observing fragile ecosystems, and conducting precise inspections of underwater structures without causing disruption.</p>

Powell has stated that her critiques of the party's direction will primarily be articulated privately as she steps into her new, directly elected senior role.</p>
