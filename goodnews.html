          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy of granting refugee status to white South Africans, stating that people should be "celebrating" the move. The administration claims white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, face oppression, citing a law that allows the government to seize privately held land. Rubio stated there is evidence of murders and forced removals of properties based on race. He added that the people who have moved to the US have done so for a reason, and "there may be more coming soon". </p>
