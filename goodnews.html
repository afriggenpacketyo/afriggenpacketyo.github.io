        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha stated that the success of women's football, particularly the England Lionesses, makes it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is aiming for a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The project may take the form of another movie or a television series, with hopes of reuniting the original cast and including cameos from current football stars.</p>

          <p>Following a viral scandal involving its CEO, tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a "very temporary" spokesperson. The company's former CEO and a human resources executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert. In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's recent publicity without directly mentioning the incident. She focused on the newfound interest in data workflow automation, aiming to shift the narrative back to the company's core business.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early setback at 0-2, an unbroken partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) thwarted the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team post a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>The question of how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts agreeing that the answer depends on the individual. While the FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, tolerance varies greatly. Recent studies have linked moderate coffee consumption to health benefits, but heavy intake can be associated with negative outcomes, especially for those with hypertension. Health professionals advise people to be mindful of their body's reaction, such as anxiety or poor sleep, and to adjust their intake accordingly, emphasizing that moderation is key.</p>

For employees burdened with debt, these workplace benefits provide a crucial lifeline, especially as the Trump administration has restarted collections on defaulted loans.
