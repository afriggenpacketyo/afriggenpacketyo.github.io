          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial was dismissed due to inconsistencies regarding his stated residence, raising concerns about his candor during jury selection. The judge determined that the juror's statements about living in the Bronx were questionable, leading to his replacement with an alternate juror from Westchester. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages from Combs' assistant about setting up a "hotel night." Combs has pleaded not guilty and faces a potential life sentence if convicted. Optimism in the judicial process is measured, as the integrity of the jury is crucial for a fair trial.</p>

The plan includes free calls to over 100 countries, roadside assistance, and telehealth services, while the phone will feature fingerprint and facial recognition unlocking, 256GB storage, and 12GB RAM.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempt to block Harvard University's international students from entering the country. The order, now extended until June 23, allows the judge time to consider a longer-term injunction against the proclamation. The Trump administration's June 4 proclamation cited Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns as reasons for limiting foreign student entry. Harvard has amended its lawsuit, arguing that the proclamation circumvents the judge's previous decision and violates the First Amendment.</p>
