          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a 1906 shipwreck on the North Sea floor as a sanctuary to reintroduce rare flat oysters, a species decimated by overfishing and disease. Researchers deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef that will purify water and support broader marine biodiversity. The wreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned. This innovative approach aims to restore a crucial component of the marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions and concerns about a depreciating U.S. dollar, wealthy investors are significantly increasing their allocation to gold.

Financial advisors note a marked uptick in interest, particularly from U.S. clients seeking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional currencies and securities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas earlier in the month, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special session of the state legislature. The session will focus on improving the state's preparedness for future natural disasters. Lawmakers are expected to discuss enhancements to flood warning systems, emergency communications, relief funding, and overall disaster recovery strategies. This legislative action is a direct response to the historic and devastating flash flooding that occurred over the July Fourth weekend.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous leader of the Los Choneros gang known as 'Fito,' to the United States. He will face federal charges in New York for international cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. This marks the first time an Ecuadorian citizen has been extradited directly from Ecuador to the U.S., representing a significant development in the bilateral cooperation against transnational organized crime. Macías had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison before being recaptured in June.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, which included failed prosecutions against 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. This decision fulfills a long-standing demand from campaigners who have sought truth and justice for four decades.</p>

          <p>Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, has stated that the budget airline is considering an increase to the bonus it pays staff for identifying and charging for passengers' oversized luggage. The current bonus is about €1.50 per bag, and O'Leary framed the potential increase as a way to further incentivize the enforcement of baggage rules and "eliminate the scourge" of excess bags that delay flights. The practice is part of the airline's broader strategy to manage on-board space and maintain its low-cost operational model.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has concluded that government, companies, and regulators are all to blame for its current troubled state. The report's key recommendations include abolishing the economic regulator Ofwat and creating a single, unified regulator to better hold companies accountable for issues like sewage spills and rising bills. It also calls for reforming the system of "operator self-monitoring" to rebuild public trust, a response to widespread anger over environmental and financial management.</p>
