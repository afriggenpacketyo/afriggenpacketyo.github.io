        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union are engaged in intense negotiations aimed at resetting their relationship post-Brexit, with discussions focusing on defense, trade, fishing rights, and youth mobility. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are leading the efforts to strike a deal that addresses key issues such as access to the EU defense fund and reciprocal youth mobility schemes. While government sources indicate substantial progress, some Conservative and Reform UK leaders have criticized the potential agreement as a "surrender," highlighting the political sensitivities surrounding the negotiations. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the future of UK-EU relations, particularly in areas of trade and security. </p>

          <p>Innovent Biologics, a Hong Kong-listed biotech firm, is poised to enter the competitive global market for weight-loss drugs, challenging industry giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The company's mazdutide drug is anticipated to gain approval for weight management and type 2 diabetes, offering a new option in the expanding Asian market, particularly in China and Japan, where obesity treatment penetration remains low. Morgan Stanley has raised its forecast for the global obesity-control drug market to $150 billion by 2035, anticipating increased focus on Asia. The entry of new players is expected to drive competition, potentially leading to lower prices and more choices for patients. </p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce a pre-arrival screening system for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of its immigration process and support its growing inbound tourism sector. Travelers from countries with visa exemptions will be required to provide personal and travel information before arrival, allowing the Immigration Services Agency to assess potential risks. The system, modeled after the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization, aims to prevent individuals with criminal records or previous illegal stays from entering the country. The initiative is part of Japan's strategy to boost tourism to 60 million visitors by 2030. </p>

          <p>A three-day strike by NJ Transit engineers has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, with train service set to resume on Tuesday. The strike, which halted train service across New Jersey, impacted over 100,000 daily riders. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, involves concessions on work rules that will fund fair wages for the union. While trains will not operate on Monday to allow for safety checks, the resolution brings relief to commuters and marks the end of New Jersey's first rail strike in decades. </p>

While Simion had strong support in the diaspora, Dan's focus on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine resonated with voters in Romania. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year on year in April, stronger than analysts' expectations, indicating the impact from U.S. tariffs was not as harsh as was being expected. Trade-war fears have receded after a meeting of U.S. and Chinese trade representatives in Switzerland earlier this month led to a lower set of levies between the world's two largest economies. Beijing and Washington agreed to roll back most tariffs for 90 days, allowing some room for further negotiation to reach a more lasting deal. </p>

          <p>Medical experts say that former President Joseph R. Biden‚Äôs diagnosis of prostate cancer is serious, but that recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have changed what was once an exceedingly grim picture for men with advanced disease. While prognoses for prostate cancer patients were once measured in months, experts say that advances in treatment and diagnosis now improve survival by years. Life is measured in years now, not months. Dr. Judd Moul, a prostate cancer expert at Duke University, said that men whose prostate cancer has spread to their bones, ‚Äúcan live 5, 7, 10 or more years‚Äù with current treatments. </p>

The union that represents the state‚Äôs passenger-train drivers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, said it called off the strike at about 6 p.m., and NJ Transit said its trains would begin running a full schedule again on Tuesday morning. For Monday, the agency said, it would rely on its original strike contingency plan involving chartered buses running from four satellite locations into New York City or to stations on the PATH commuter train service. The main sticking point had been the engineers‚Äô demand that they be paid on par with their counterparts who drive trains for other passenger railroads, including Amtrak and New York‚Äôs commuter railroads. </p>

From June, patients signing up to a GP practice, who received a blood transfusion before 1996, will be offered a test for hepatitis C.
