          <p>Investment research firm Morningstar has introduced the Modern Market 100, a new benchmark index designed to track the performance of both public and private companies. The index comprises 90 large public firms and 10 prominent venture-backed private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, reflecting a modern investment landscape where major companies are staying private longer. This innovative index aims to provide investors with a more comprehensive view of the U.S. economy's most dynamic sectors. The firm hopes it will serve as a framework for benchmarking performance across these increasingly intertwined asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Police Watchdog Suggests Ending the Recording of Non-Crime Hate Incidents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:44:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales, Sir Andy Cooke, has stated that the police practice of recording "non-crime hate incidents" is no longer required. He argued that intelligence can be gathered differently and that people should be allowed to speak openly without fear of their opinions being recorded by police. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not meet the criminal threshold. The comments contribute to a wider debate in the UK about the policing of speech, particularly online, and balancing free expression with data collection on potential escalations of hate.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:24:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks to set their own limits for contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. Currently capped at £100, the change would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which have no spending cap. While the move aims to reduce "payment friction" for larger purchases, it has raised concerns about potential fraud and theft. The FCA stated that card providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would need to implement robust risk-prevention systems, while consumers would retain their existing protections.</p>

          <p>Lachlan Murdoch, the 54-year-old eldest son of Rupert Murdoch, has been officially named the leader of the family's conservative media empire, which includes Fox Corp. and News Corp. His ascension concludes a long-standing succession rivalry with his younger brother, James. Observers note that Lachlan, while seen as conservative, has a more "hands-off" approach than his father and may not seek the same "kingmaker" role in politics. Under his recent leadership as CEO, Fox Corp. has faced significant defamation lawsuits over its 2020 election coverage while also achieving substantial revenue growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are examining Costa Rica as a model for healthy living, noting its population has a longer life expectancy and a 40% lower cancer death rate than the U.S., despite spending far less on healthcare. Factors contributing to this success include low smoking rates and a traditional diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, and rice. Additionally, a lifestyle that incorporates more walking and strong social and community connections is believed to play a significant role. While the country is facing new health challenges from urbanization, its historical success provides valuable lessons in preventative health.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 05:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill aimed at fostering artificial intelligence innovation by reducing regulatory obstacles for companies. The proposal would require the federal government to establish a "regulatory sandbox," a secure testing environment where AI firms could apply for temporary waivers from specific regulations that hinder their product development. For instance, a company could request a modification to HIPAA rules to test a cancer-screening tool, provided it doesn't compromise patient privacy. The initiative reflects a concern that the U.S. risks falling behind competitors like China if AI development is overly burdened by existing regulations.</p>

This positive momentum reassured the market about the company's performance and outlook. The strong start to the new season suggests resilient consumer demand for its brands despite broader economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an artificial intelligence system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This AI-powered "third hand" can perform routine tasks such as retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, freeing up the surgeon to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. Published in the journal Science Robotics, the innovation aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons and potentially reduce patient wait times, especially as aging populations increase clinical demand. The system works alongside two other robotic arms that are directly controlled by the surgeon.</p>

The deal marks Cambodia as the fourth Southeast Asian country to operate the aircraft, formerly known as the ARJ21, joining Indonesia, Laos, and Vietnam. The C909, which can seat between 78 and 97 passengers, is designed for short-haul flights and is a key part of China's strategy to compete in the global aviation market. This agreement significantly expands the presence of Chinese-made commercial aircraft within the strategically important Southeast Asian region.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is re-examining the cultural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete tower blocks that defined much of the urban landscape in the former East German Democratic Republic (GDR). These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to postwar housing shortages but later became symbols of urban decay and social problems following German reunification. The exhibition explores the architecture's dual identity as both a shared living space and a site of painful societal transformation. It reflects a growing interest in revisiting the complex history of the GDR through its distinctive architectural heritage.</p>
