        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the possibility of another "China shock" due to overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts on exports as domestic demand remains weak, which could flood global markets with cheap goods. While this situation raises concerns about squeezing local industries, economists suggest it could also provide a silver lining by lowering costs for consumers in inflation-hit economies. This influx of low-cost goods may offer central banks some relief as they try to balance lowering living costs with reviving growth amid trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article previews the French Open semi-finals, highlighting Novak Djokovic's pursuit of more history as he faces Jannik Sinner. Djokovic, at 38, is the oldest man to reach the semi-finals since 1968, with Zverev saying that he is currently underrated. Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is set to continue his dominance over Lorenzo Musetti in the second semi-final. The article emphasizes the shift in tennis, with younger players born after 2000 capturing major titles, while veterans like Djokovic still remain formidable.</p>

          <p>India's central bank delivered a larger-than-expected rate cut, lowering its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra attributed the move to softening inflation and slower growth amid global challenges. While the decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI highlighted growth concerns amid tariff threats and revised its inflation outlook downward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could automate jobs and cut wages, new research by PwC suggests AI actually makes people "more valuable, not less." The report found that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, including those that are the most automatable. Wages of workers with AI skills are on average 56% higher compared to workers without these skills. The report challenges common myths about AI's impact, such as its effect on productivity, wages, job numbers, inequality, skills, and automation.</p>

Journalism, despite being boxed in early, waited for the right moment, navigated through chaos, and surged to victory in the end. The article highlights the horse's throwback style, reminding readers that some victories are earned through strategic timing rather than immediate speed.</p>
