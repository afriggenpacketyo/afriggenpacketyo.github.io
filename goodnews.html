        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cieran Slicker had a rough debut for Scotland amid a goalkeeping injury crisis, leaving manager Steve Clarke with limited options. With several keepers out injured, Robby McCrorie's warm-up injury compounded the problem. Former Scotland defender Willie Miller emphasized the need to assess Slicker's mindset before potentially putting him back in the firing line. Clarke might consider Jon McLaughlin, a seasoned player, or look at other Scottish-based options like Scott Bain or Ross Doohan as potential replacements for upcoming friendlies, navigating a challenging situation to find a reliable option in goal. The team is trying to find a stable footing despite the adversity. </p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing difficulties in forming coalitions in local councils despite gains in recent elections. The party's focus on national issues like immigration, rather than local policy, has made cooperation with established parties challenging. In Cornwall, other parties refused to work with Reform UK, leading to a Lib Dem-independent coalition. Reform UK's uncompromising stance and lack of local policy platforms have hindered its ability to participate in formal coalitions, leaving the party navigating minority administrations and potential deal-making on key decisions. The party is navigating the political landscape after making gains.</p>

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a popular Welsh dish, has varied origin stories, including being a joke by the English. Some believe it was a substitute for meat by poor farmers, while others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Food historian Carwyn Graves connects rarebit to Welsh cultural identity, with cheese being a vital part of European diets, especially in Wales. Despite different theories, Welsh rarebit remains a beloved comfort food with a rich history and cultural significance, celebrated for its unique flavor and nostalgic appeal. The dish has a rich history and a bright future.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting them was unconstitutional, stating that teaching yoga is "protected speech". The court sided with instructors who sued over a law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks. The city argued the rule was about commercial activity, not yoga, but the court found it violated the instructors' First Amendment rights. Advocates say outdoor yoga provides a service to those with disabilities or who cannot afford classes elsewhere, marking a victory for community access and freedom of expression. The classes are now back in session.</p>
