          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity is expected to expand in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, as new players like Innovent Biologics vie with giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for a share of the multibillion-dollar industry. Innovent Biologics' mazdutide drug is expected to receive approval for weight management and type 2 diabetes this year, increasing competition and potentially lowering prices for patients and physicians. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for obesity-control drugs worldwide to US$150 billion by 2035, emphasizing the growing focus on Asia's obesity market due to low penetration and emerging innovation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially stalled it over concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, with four conservative holdouts voting present, allowing the bill to move forward. The legislation extends tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill still faces potential obstacles in the Rules Committee and the Senate, with conservatives seeking stricter work requirements for Medicaid and an end to clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of immigration processes and boost inbound tourism. The new system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information before arrival. This will enable the Immigration Services Agency to assess travelers' data in advance, potentially denying boarding to those with criminal records or previous illegal stays in Japan. The initiative aims to support Japan's growth strategy, targeting 60 million foreign visitors by 2030.</p>

          <p>Experts highlight recent advancements in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, leading to improved survival rates for patients. While former President Biden's diagnosis of Stage 4 prostate cancer is serious, new treatments have transformed the prognosis, extending life expectancy by years. The first line of attack is to cut off the testosterone that feeds prostate cancer. Doctors now have more precise scans to detect cancer earlier and can use drugs that block testosterone, chemotherapy, or radiation. Federal research funding, particularly through Biden‚Äôs cancer moonshot effort, has significantly contributed to this progress.</p>
