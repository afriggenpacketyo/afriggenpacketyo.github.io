          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, despite ongoing issues related to overtourism, the satisfaction rate among tourists remains high. According to a survey, 97.2 percent of foreign respondents and 94.6 percent of Japanese respondents were at least fairly satisfied with their visit. Temples, shrines, and historic sites like Kiyomizu temple and Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine were the most visited locations. The city plans to implement a lodging tax increase to address overtourism.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is under scrutiny as Japan faces a potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions. A new panda loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan, though the gesture may not carry the same diplomatic weight as before.</p>

          <p>As AI usage increases, more cases of potentially harmful responses, such as hate speech and copyright infringements, are being uncovered. Researchers emphasize the need for more regulations and thorough testing of AI models to address these issues. Red teaming, a practice involving testing AI systems to identify potential harm, is suggested as a method to evaluate risks. Standardized AI flaw reports and incentives are recommended to disseminate information on these flaws effectively, mirroring practices in software security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies five phrases that hinder children's cooperation and offers alternative communication strategies. These strategies include explaining reasoning instead of demanding obedience, offering agency within boundaries, validating emotions, inviting problem-solving, and encouraging self-reflection. The research suggests that creating a respectful and emotionally safe environment fosters cooperation and raises emotionally resilient children. The approach emphasizes partnership and understanding over control and criticism.</p>

NHS England plans a staggered approach to manage resources and GP workload, with wider availability expected in phases over the next few years. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments, while pharmacy trade organizations express concern that demand will outstrip supply.

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. The Chinese government has invested heavily in the EV industry, providing subsidies to consumers and carmakers, and dominating critical supply chains in battery production. Chinese EV makers are now looking to sell more cars overseas. Despite import taxes imposed by some countries, Chinese EVs are becoming increasingly attractive to consumers due to their affordability and technology.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic offering ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression, particularly for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments. This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is primarily known as an anaesthetic and recreational drug, it has shown potential in treating treatment-resistant depression. Esketamine, a form of ketamine taken as a nasal spray, has been approved for the treatment for moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression in Scotland.</p>
