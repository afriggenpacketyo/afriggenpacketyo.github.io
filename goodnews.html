          <p>Former WNBA star Angel McCoughtry has criticized Chicago Sky rookie Hailey Van Lith, suggesting her popularity on social media played a role in her draft selection. McCoughtry questioned whether Van Lith would be in the league if she had fewer followers, implying that other players with better talent may be overlooked due to their lack of social media presence. Van Lith, a solid guard who played for Louisville and LSU before transferring to TCU, has a significant social media following. McCoughtry later apologized for singling out Van Lith, acknowledging that she worked hard for everything she achieved.</p>

          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored two goals to lead Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Group G match at the Club World Cup in Philadelphia. Juventus took an early lead, with Yildiz's shot forcing an own goal, followed by a spectacular strike from Yildiz himself. Despite a goal from Wydad's Thembinkosi Lorch, Yildiz scored again in the second half, and Du≈°an Vlahoviƒá added a penalty to secure the win for Juventus. This victory eliminates Wydad, and Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City.</p>

          <p>Local Iranians in Los Angeles are finding comfort in Persian restaurants and neighborhoods like Tehrangeles as war spreads, providing spaces to connect with their culture. Restaurants like Azizam are hosting complimentary tea and backgammon, offering a safe space for Iranians to relax and come together. Many Iranian Americans, while critical of the Iranian regime, express fear and anxiety for their families and friends in Iran. Despite divisions within the Persian diaspora, many hope to bridge the divide and seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A rare June heatwave is gripping parts of the United States, with tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East bracing for dangerously hot temperatures. Many areas are under heat advisories, with heat indices expected to exceed 100¬∞F. Cities are opening cooling centers, and events are being modified to cope with the extreme heat. Meteorologists attribute the heatwave to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran and struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced slight losses. Analysts suggest the Gulf markets have distanced themselves from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped to isolate them from any significant short-term market impact. Despite regional tensions, the net mid-term outlook is positive, with the removal of the Iranian threat potentially benefiting international investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Phrases to Avoid When Talking to Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships has identified five toxic phrases that make children refuse to listen. The phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should use language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, such as "I know you don't like this decision. I'll explain, and then we're moving forward" and "I see you're really upset. Tell me what's happening." This approach creates conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from spending 5% of its gross domestic product on defense, according to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez stated that such spending would be "disproportionate and unnecessary," adding that Spain could meet its commitments to NATO by spending only 2.1% of its GDP. This decision comes after Spain had previously raised concerns about a new 5% spending target, potentially derailing the upcoming NATO summit.</p>

The pilot program will likely involve a small number of cars operating in a "geofenced area." The launch comes after years of teasing a new line of self-driving vehicles, and Musk has said the first driverless trip "from factory end of line all the way to a customer house" is set to take place soon. Autonomous vehicles have drawn scrutiny from government officials, and Tesla is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, with Spain securing an exemption. The agreement calls for at least 3.5% of national GDP to be spent on core military needs, with an additional 1.5% allocated for related expenditures. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had fought the deal, stating that the 5% figure "would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive." This decision reflects ongoing debates within NATO regarding burden-sharing and defense priorities. (not investment advice)</p>
