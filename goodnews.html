The leaders discussed the importance of strengthening bilateral ties and explored the possibility of a face-to-face meeting. Ishiba emphasized the significance of dialogue and cooperation between the two nations to address global challenges. Ishiba is expected to attend the upcoming G7 meeting in Canada, where Lee has also been invited to participate, despite South Korea not being a G7 member. Relations between Japan and South Korea improved under Lee's predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, despite historical difficulties stemming from Japan's colonial rule.</p>

The move signals Japan's proactive approach to addressing potential threats and maintaining stability in the area. The increased military presence is intended to serve as a deterrent and safeguard Japan's interests.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed.</p>

          <p>China has started mass production of the world‚Äôs first non-binary AI chip, developed by Professor Li Hongge‚Äôs team at Beihang University in Beijing. This breakthrough overcomes limitations in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, enabling greater fault tolerance and power efficiency. The new chip is designed for intelligent control applications, such as touch displays and flight systems, while also circumventing U.S. chip restrictions. The Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, offering an alternative to binary logic, which requires extensive hardware resources.</p>
