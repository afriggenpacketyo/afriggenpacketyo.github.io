          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is returning to ABC after a brief suspension, a move widely seen as a response to a significant public relations backlash against the network and its parent company, Disney. Kimmel was suspended for comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which were deemed insensitive and inaccurate. The suspension drew widespread criticism from free speech advocates, celebrities, and even FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's initial pressure was walked back. This article argues that ABC's reversal was inevitable to mitigate the damage to its reputation, positioning Kimmel as the victor in a debacle that has tarnished the image of Disney and its executives.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year, despite policy rollbacks by the Trump administration. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics indicates that the sector maintains strong momentum, with low-carbon energy expected to attract about $2.2 trillion this year, double the investment in fossil fuels. The analysis also found that major corporations are continuing to pursue their net-zero commitments, with companies representing 70% of top global revenue actively working on climate plans. While progress is evident, the report stresses that both countries and companies must accelerate their actions to bridge the gap between climate aspirations and implementation.

The structure, a concrete-face rockfill dam, is the world's first of its kind to be built with full-scale AI, digital twin technology, and unmanned equipment. This innovative construction method, likened to 3D printing, was employed to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The project represents a major milestone in applying artificial intelligence to large-scale infrastructure development, showcasing a new frontier in engineering and construction.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, tracking a rally on Wall Street where all three major U.S. indexes reached new record highs. The positive momentum in the U.S. was largely driven by Nvidia's announcement of a potential $100 billion investment in OpenAI for data center construction, which caused its shares to surge. Global investors are also considering recent developments in U.S.-China relations, with the U.S. ambassador suggesting a meeting between the two nations' presidents is more likely in early 2026. Traders in Europe will be closely watching upcoming economic data releases, including manufacturing PMI data for Germany and the U.K. (not investment advice)</p>

Seazen's move to sell two-year dollar notes indicates that refinancing channels, largely closed during the property crisis, are reopening due to a more favorable interest-rate environment. This resurgence suggests a potential rebuilding of trust in sectors that many global investors had previously considered too risky. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more probable for early next year rather than this fall, according to U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Perdue noted that the relationship between the two leaders is currently "very good and very encouraging." His comments followed a recent phone call between Trump and Xi, after which Trump had suggested a meeting could happen soon. The ambassador's remarks were made during a rare visit by a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation aimed at improving communication, particularly on military issues, between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, an Australian pediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience, has written an opinion piece to reassure the public about the safety of paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy. His comments come in response to recent claims by U.S. President Donald Trump linking the medication to autism, which Dr. Freelander calls worrying and not based on scientific evidence. He emphasizes that major studies have disproven a causative link and that medicine regulators worldwide, including Australia's TGA, consider paracetamol a safe and important medication for pregnant women. He urges the public to trust expert regulatory bodies over "unscientific and poorly informed health policy."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific reasons for the funding cuts. The suspended grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health, support critical medical research into conditions like Parkinson's disease and cancer. This ruling is part of a broader conflict where the administration has used federal funding to pressure universities over issues like antisemitism and diversity initiatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how modern football tactics, particularly in the Premier League, are increasingly adopting strategies once championed and criticized in Sam Allardyce's management style. Elements like direct, long-ball play, the use of a tall striker, and a heavy emphasis on set-pieces are becoming more common, moving away from the possession-based game that has recently dominated. Allardyce reflects on being "ahead of the game" with methods like watching from the stands for a better tactical overview, which coaches like PSG's Luis Enrique now use. The piece suggests that the fear of criticism is fading as more coaches recognize the statistical effectiveness of these direct approaches.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent academic at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, is urging China to develop its own unique knowledge system for foreign relations, distinct from dominant Western theories. In an interview with People's Daily, he argued that such a system is strategically necessary to more effectively explain China's global role and foreign policy to the world. This call for "intellectual autonomy" aligns with Beijing's Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar world order. The argument posits that for too long, international relations have been interpreted solely through a Western lens, and a China-centric framework is needed to articulate its own perspective.</p>

Thorne praised the "remarkable" work of the journalists who held their own industry to account, noting that the story goes beyond bad behavior to reveal a troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians. The drama, made by the same team behind "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," aims to uncover the detailed complexities of the scandal from the perspectives of both the journalist and a police detective.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes China's decision to reject stripped-down versions of Nvidia's advanced AI chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The author argues that by ordering tech companies to halt purchases of these chips, Beijing is signaling a major shift from technological dependence to a determined push for self-reliance. Accepting the less powerful chips would have been seen as accepting a U.S.-dictated technological inferiority. The U.S. policy, intended as a compromise, instead strengthened the case within China for indigenous innovation, turning what was once a distant goal into a national strategic necessity.</p>
