          <h2>US and UK Reach Trade Agreement Amidst Ongoing Tariff Disputes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 23:55:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers report on the new trade agreement between the US and the UK, highlighting its potential to alleviate some of the tariffs imposed by the US. The agreement, described as 'historic' by both Sir Keir Starmer and President Trump, aims to save British car industry jobs, with the UK securing concessions on car and steel exports. However, a flat ten percent levy on most goods remains in place, and the pact includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain. The papers also reflect on the end of four days of events and celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, aiming to reduce the burden of tariffs and deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal, the first in Trump's second term, includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, with exceptions for the first 100,000 vehicles. The framework is expected to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. and create new export opportunities for American farmers.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, producers of tungsten products in developed nations are diversifying their raw material supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on critical industrial metals. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February as retaliation against Washington's decision to raise duties on all Chinese imports. US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge to stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. China accounted for 82.7% of global raw tungsten ore mined last year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year with a 10 percent tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement, one of 17 the Trump administration is trying to strike with major trading partners, provides hints for other countries on the U.S. approach to tariffs. The agreement leaves in place a 10 percent baseline tariff that Trump imposed in April on almost all countries.</p>

          <p>India is signaling a major shift in its trade approach, proposing zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis. This move comes after President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports and aims to boost India's economic growth. Experts suggest that a trade deal could benefit sectors like financials, materials, and healthcare, while logistics companies are expected to thrive regardless of the outcome. The article also touches on India's strikes against Pakistan and a bilateral trade agreement with the U.K.</p>

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary, 'Pavements,' explores the essence of the 90s indie-rock band Pavement. The film combines tour footage, a musical, a museum exhibition, and a faux-Hollywood biopic to capture the band's history and legacy. The behind-the-scenes clips of the Pavement musical are delightful, showcasing theater kids singing through a catalog that defies their essential earnestness. The movie also touches on how a B-side called 'Harness Your Hopes' became the band's biggest hit ever, thanks to social media algorithms.</p>
