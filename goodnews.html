          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 09:47:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A resurgence in nuclear energy is underway in the United States, driven by the immense power requirements of AI and data centers. In places like Covert Township, Michigan, the decommissioned Palisades Nuclear Plant is being revived, and plans are in motion to build new small modular reactors (SMRs). This shift is bolstered by federal loans, investments from tech giants like Bill Gates and Microsoft, and growing public acceptance, though experts remain divided on the timeline for widespread SMR deployment due to regulatory and cost challenges. The article highlights how local communities anticipate economic stability from this nuclear renaissance.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview and his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout," musician Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, reflects on his journey through fame, faith, and controversy. He discusses his early success, his conversion to Islam which led him to step away from music for nearly three decades, and his eventual return after realizing his initial understanding of the faith's view on music was incomplete. The article touches on his enduring themes of peace and his current identity performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, which he feels represents the complete picture of who he is.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common reason couples fight is not about major issues like money or sex, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Nonverbal cues such as a sigh or a sharp edge in one's voice can turn a simple question into an accusation, carrying more emotional weight than the words themselves. The article suggests practical solutions for both partners, such as pausing to rephrase a harsh statement or calmly asking a partner to speak differently. For couples stuck in a negative cycle, using a "reset phrase" or inside joke can defuse tension and allow for more productive communication.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from being seen as well-meaning environmentalists to a more insurgent political force. Polanski has embraced a bolder, more confrontational "eco-populist" approach, aiming to "pick fights" to gain public attention and cut through a splintered political landscape. While the party has seen a surge in membership, some members worry this new direction could alienate rural voters who were key to recent electoral successes. The party is now targeting urban constituencies and studying the methods of rivals like Reform UK to turn its growing momentum into actual votes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the United States, such as Jericho High School in New York, are implementing "bell to bell" cellphone bans, resulting in notable changes in student behavior. While some students initially experience separation anxiety, many report feeling more engaged in class discussions and discovering interests in subjects they previously found boring. Administrators observe that common areas like cafeterias have become louder and more social, as students are communicating face-to-face instead of looking at their screens. The policy also addresses parental concerns about emergencies, directing them to contact the school office, thereby reducing classroom distractions.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge identifies the single most important rule for parents in a high-tech world as prohibiting electronic devices in children's bedrooms overnight. She argues this straightforward, no-cost rule is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Insufficient sleep in adolescents is linked to numerous negative outcomes, including depression and illness, and devices in the bedroom are a primary cause of sleep disruption. While acknowledging that implementing this rule with older children can be challenging, Twenge advises parents to be firm and explain that the change is for their well-being.</p>

          <p>The romance fiction genre has become a dominant force in the publishing industry, largely due to its highly engaged and collaborative community, known as "Romancelandia." This "open-elite network" of authors, readers, and booksellers rapidly adapts to new technologies and platforms like TikTok, driving massive sales growth even as other categories decline. Romance authors often operate as entrepreneurs, publishing frequently and building direct relationships with their voracious readership through social media and book clubs. This unique ecosystem, which combines artistic creation with shrewd business practices, has made the genre's success a model that other parts of the publishing world are eager but may find difficult to replicate.</p>

Key provisions include the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain new and used equipment purchases, a significant increase from the previous 40% deduction. The law also restores the ability for companies to immediately deduct 100% of domestic research and development (R&D) costs, reversing a less favorable amortization rule from 2017. Additionally, the bill revives a more generous calculation for deducting business loan interest, further reducing the tax burden on growing companies. (not investment advice)</p>

After a second call to the same location, firefighters traced the scent to a durian in an Asian supermarket, which had been spread by the ventilation system.

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump will introduce significant changes to how charitable donations are deducted, impacting year-end giving strategies. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, allowing them to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers, potentially encouraging them to delay smaller 2025 gifts. Conversely, higher earners may see their benefit shrink in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap on the benefit for those in the top tax bracket. Financial experts suggest this could incentivize top earners to accelerate donations into 2025, possibly through donor-advised funds. (not investment advice)</p>
