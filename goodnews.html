          <p>President Trump announced that the United States will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, with the goal of bolstering the American steel industry. He claimed that the increased tariffs would prevent foreign steel companies from circumventing trade barriers. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least ten years, promising no layoffs or outsourcing as a result of the deal. U.S. Steel workers are expected to receive a $5,000 bonus as part of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 87. Swit won two Emmy awards for her portrayal of the tough but vulnerable Army nurse in the series, which ran for 11 seasons and tackled issues like racism, sexism, and PTSD. In addition to her work on M*A*S*H, Swit appeared in numerous other TV shows, movies, and stage productions, and was an animal rights activist. Jamie Farr, who co-starred in M*A*S*H, remembered Swit as his "adopted sister" and expressed how much she would be missed.</p>

Throughout the series, Swit aimed to portray Houlihan as a complex character, evolving beyond the "Hot Lips" nickname. She expressed a desire for her character to have a different ending, but acknowledged the impact of her role on inspiring women to pursue nursing.</p>

These challenges are mirrored in other parts of the world as governments race to adopt AI technology, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical and societal implications.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans also cooled, potentially reflecting an early response to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs could push prices higher, but the timing and impact of those duties are now uncertain after a court ruling. Walmart and Best Buy executives have indicated that they will increase prices to account for the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
