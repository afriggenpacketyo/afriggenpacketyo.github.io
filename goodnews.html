          <p>House Republicans pushed forward President Trump's budget package after overcoming initial resistance from conservatives who felt the spending cuts were insufficient. The bill, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. Negotiations continued over the weekend, leading to minor modifications to address concerns about Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies. The article details the compromises made and the ongoing challenges to passing the legislation, including pushback from blue-state Republicans over state and local tax deductions.

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal, with train service set to resume on Tuesday. The article discusses the agreement, which followed a four-day strike that disrupted commutes for over 100,000 riders. While specifics of the deal remain undisclosed pending union ratification, it reportedly involves concessions on work rules to offset wage increases. The agency needs a day to prepare equipment and conduct safety checks, and commuters are asked to work from home on Monday to ease the transition.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners.

Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland. (not investment advice)</p>
