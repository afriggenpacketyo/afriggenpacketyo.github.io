          <h2>Bessent Highlights Progress in Strategic Decoupling with China Through Tariff Agreement</h2>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China marks progress in the U.S.'s strategic decoupling from reliance on Chinese products, focusing on essential sectors exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. While a complete break is unlikely, the agreement aims to secure vital U.S. interests by creating domestic steel and protecting industries like critical medicines and semiconductors through tariffs. The deal includes a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties, with a 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl remaining in place, and Bessent expressed optimism about China's assistance in stopping the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs. Further talks are expected in the coming weeks to build upon this initial progress.</p>

Best Buy and Tesla shares rose significantly, with Deutsche Bank noting that the market's reaction suggests a reversal of recent economic anxieties.

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order to lower drug prices by tying the amount the government pays for some medicines to lower prices in other countries, reviving a controversial policy from his first term. The 'most favored nation' policy aims to address the issue of high U.S. prescription drug prices, which are significantly higher than in other developed nations. The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on unfair foreign policies that suppress drug prices abroad, while encouraging drugmakers to offer 'most favored nation prices' on direct-to-consumer sales. Shares of U.S. drugmakers dropped in premarket trading ahead of the announcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This 'most favored nation' policy aims to lower medication costs, which Trump claims will save the government trillions of dollars. The proposal would likely impact drugs administered in a doctor's office, such as infusions and injectables, but faces opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will hurt profits and innovation. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and concerns from stakeholders.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating efforts to address homelessness by urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property, offering a template for a local ordinance. Despite spending billions on housing and treatment programs, Newsom's move reflects a tougher stance on the visible aspects of the crisis, though the model ordinance does not specify criminal penalties. While he cannot force cities to adopt the ban, it coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state housing funds that local officials can use to implement the template. This approach signals a potential shift in the Democratic Party's approach to homelessness, balancing compassion with stricter measures.</p>

Additionally, lowering interest rates through balance transfer credit cards or debt consolidation loans can significantly reduce debt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As GLP-1 drugs gain popularity, diners are navigating new restaurant etiquette, with those on the medications eating less and those dining with them adjusting accordingly. Individuals on GLP-1s often order dishes to share but eat only a few bites, while their companions finish the rest, leading to new social dynamics. Some diners on GLP-1s now prefer restaurants that serve family-style dishes or small plates to avoid the awkwardness of leaving food behind. Others openly discuss their medication use to normalize the situation and prevent assumptions about their enjoyment of the food.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. will launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service, called Fox One, before the NFL season later this year, according to CEO Lachlan Murdoch. The pricing will align with wholesale pricing, similar to what pay-TV distributors pay for channels, and cable TV subscribers will access the service at no extra cost. Fox aims to avoid losing traditional cable subscribers to Fox One and will explore partnerships with other distributors. This move comes after Fox abandoned efforts to launch a joint venture sports streaming app with Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney.</p>
