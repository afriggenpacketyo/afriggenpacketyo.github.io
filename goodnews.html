          <p>Single-family offices, facing economic uncertainties due to President Trump's tariffs, have reduced their direct investments, but artificial intelligence startups remain a focal point. According to Fintrx, AI-related startups accounted for half of the direct deals made by family offices last month. SandboxAQ, an AI firm using AI and quantum technology for large-scale predictions, finalized a $450 million Series E round with investments from billionaires and their family offices, including Ray Dalio's. CEO Jack Hidary notes that professionally managed family offices are showing increased interest in deep-tech startups, recognizing their lower risk compared to consumer-oriented tech companies.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have an appeal of her 2022 fraud conviction reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court denied her request for a rehearing before the original three-judge panel that upheld her conviction, and no judge on the circuit court requested a vote on a full court rehearing. This decision leaves the Supreme Court as Holmes' last chance to overturn her conviction, where she was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison for deceiving investors about Theranos' blood-testing capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade deal with the United Kingdom, but many details of the agreement have been left to later discussions, leaving observers unsure whether to call it a deal, an agreement, or a framework. While UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer conceded that they are still working out the details, Trump appeared keen to make a public announcement. Experts suggest that the coming negotiations could take months and that the announcement was mainly an 'agreement to negotiate,' with those negotiations potentially hitting thorny issues such as UK restrictions on US agricultural exports and Trump's tariffs on foreign film shoots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a home equity line of credit (HELOC) should be aware of minimum draw requirements, which can significantly impact the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw, even if the borrower doesn't immediately need the funds, potentially leading to unnecessary interest charges. Ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period may also apply, potentially affecting repayment plans and overall borrowing costs. Understanding these requirements is crucial, as they can complicate repayment strategies and lead to payment shock if borrowers are not prepared.</p>

This remote location makes it a good laboratory for refining tools for eruption forecasting, as the eruptions don't impact anyone.</p>
