          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a company that rents data centers for artificial intelligence, increased after it announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The capital raised from the sale, which involves notes due in 2031, is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a previous successful debt offering and a major investment in a new AI data center, signaling strong investor confidence despite some concerns about the company's debt levels and the sustainability of AI demand.

          <p>Mita Mallick, a bestselling author and workplace strategist, recounts how blunt criticism from a former manager became a pivotal moment in her career. Early on, she was too shy to speak in meetings, leading her boss to call her a "wallflower" and state that she lacked leadership potential. Though devastating at the time, Mallick says the feedback was necessary and motivated her to practice public speaking and build her confidence. She now views the experience, despite its harsh delivery, as a thankful turning point.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike firms that simply hold cryptocurrency, this company plans to generate yield through "staking," a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security and operations. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as investors can earn a dividend in addition to price exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn a return that can outpace inflation and preserve buying power. Current rates on top CDs, especially from online banks, are significantly higher than the national averages, with some short-term CDs offering yields over 4.40% APY. The article notes an "inverted yield curve" phenomenon, where shorter-term CDs (6-12 months) currently provide better rates than longer-term ones (3-5 years), making them an attractive option for savers.

The article advises that borrowers with strong credit profiles in the mid-to-high 700s are most likely to secure the best rates.

Geopolitical instability and movements in the U.S. dollar also play a significant role, as a weaker dollar can make gold cheaper for foreign investors, thereby increasing demand and driving up its price.

          <p>To combat "neijuan," or involution, a cycle of hyper-competition yielding diminishing returns, analysts in China are urging the government to implement policies that boost domestic demand. A report from China International Capital Corporation argues that expanding the overall market size would create an "incremental cake," reducing the pressure on companies engaged in inefficient, zero-sum competition. The analysts suggest that top-down macroeconomic policies are essential, as individual company actions like increasing R&D are insufficient to solve the systemic problem. (not investment advice)</p>
