          <p>Former UCLA basketball coach Ben Howland remains grateful for his time with the Bruins, frequently visiting practices and games. Howland, who led UCLA to three consecutive Final Fours, enjoys watching the current team under coach Mick Cronin, whom he admires for his old-school coaching style. Howland also shared his thoughts on current UCLA players, expressing excitement about transfer point guard Donovan Dent and transfer big man Xavier Booker, and he expressed his disappointment that Aday Mara transferred to Michigan. He also supports the idea of honoring Final Four teams with banners in Pauley Pavilion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of historical resistance to Nazism offers insights for the US left, emphasizing the importance of focused action over mere broadcasting of opinions. The German activist Emmi Bonhoeffer's support group for Holocaust survivors exemplifies effective resistance by creating tangible change without seeking attention. The author argues that the US left's judgmental streak and failure to empathize with Trump supporters hinders its effectiveness. The key to resisting far-right extremism lies in creating a better future for everyone, including those who have been misled, and embracing shared humanity.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that despite the United States' direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific will remain unchanged. While the U.S. has redeployed forces to address the conflict, including temporarily shifting assets away from the Indo-Pacific, it has repeatedly pledged to prioritize strategic resources on China. Observers note that the decision to strike Iran expands U.S. military engagement in the Middle East, but Washington's commitment to the Indo-Pacific remains steadfast. The redeployment of the USS Nimitz prompted caution from Taiwan, which relies heavily on the U.S. military presence in the region.</p>

The Lib Dems claim the initiative would urgently boost troop numbers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000, and the ¬£60 million cost would be covered by the main defence budget. This proposal is part of a broader effort to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.</p>
