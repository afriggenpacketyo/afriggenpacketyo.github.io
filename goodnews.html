          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer and sexual assaulter known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was captured near the Arkansas prison he escaped from after a 13-day manhunt. Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. The search involved bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and helicopters, with a U.S. Border Patrol team joining the effort. The lack of verification before Hardin's escape is being investigated, while the community breathes a sigh of relief after his capture.</p>
