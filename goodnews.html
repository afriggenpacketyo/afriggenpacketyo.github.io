          <p>President Trump is promoting a dinner open to those who purchase enough of his meme coin, which has generated over $320 million in fees for its creators. This arrangement allows the Trump family to monetize access to the president. The meme coin's value jumped after the dinner announcement, and creators profit from trading fees within the liquidity pool. Critics argue this mixes politics with personal finances, allowing bad actors to influence the president. The remaining coins are allocated to CIC Digital and another company, with an ethics agreement limiting Trump's direct involvement. </p>

The State Board of Elections is ordered to certify results showing Riggs winning by 734 votes, but the decision is delayed for a week pending a possible appeal.

Attorneys for Zaid suspect he came onto President Trump's radar after representing a whistleblower in 2019 who filed a complaint about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian President. </p>
