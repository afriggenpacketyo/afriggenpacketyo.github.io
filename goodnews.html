          <p>As markets await a key Federal Reserve interest rate decision, the CNBC Investing Club outlined its current portfolio strategy. The club plans to trim its position in Broadcom to lock in recent gains, as the stock's weighting has grown to over 5% of the portfolio. Conversely, it sees the recent dip in Boeing's stock, caused by news of a 777X certification delay, as a buying opportunity that doesn't alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory. The article also notes upcoming investor events for DuPont and CrowdStrike, reiterating positive outlooks on both companies ahead of their respective presentations. (not investment advice)</p>

It is launching a new, U.S.-regulated stablecoin called USAT, specifically designed for American businesses and institutions under the GENIUS Act. To lead this expansion, the company has appointed Bo Hines, a former White House advisor, as the CEO of its new U.S. division based in North Carolina. These moves signal Tether's strategy to engage more closely with U.S. regulators and strengthen the dollar's dominance in the digital asset economy, with Anchorage Digital serving as the issuer for USAT.</p>

          <p>Amazon is backing Fable, a San Francisco-based startup whose artificial intelligence platform, Showrunner, allows users to generate animated TV show episodes from simple text prompts. The investment, made through Amazon's Alexa Fund, highlights growing interest in AI-powered entertainment that transforms viewers into creators. Fable's CEO, Edward Saatchi, envisions a future where streaming services become interactive, allowing audiences to co-create content rather than just consume it. The Showrunner platform is currently focused on animation, which is less complex for AI to generate than photorealistic video, and has already produced satirical content lampooning Silicon Valley culture.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a new pilot program aimed at speeding up the development and safe deployment of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Key industry players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have confirmed their participation in the program, which will establish public-private partnerships to advance the technology. The initiative follows a recent executive order from President Trump to foster eVTOL innovation in the U.S. The move is seen as a critical step toward making commercial air taxi services a reality, with supervised trials potentially beginning as early as next year.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to support Ukrainians who have suffered life-changing injuries during the war with Russia. He arrived by train after an invitation from the Superhumans organization, which provides prosthetics and rehabilitation services to soldiers and civilians. Stating his desire to "do everything possible" to aid in their recovery, this marks his first visit to the Ukrainian capital, though he previously visited a Superhumans center in Lviv. The visit aligns with his work with the Invictus Games Foundation, which supports the rehabilitation of wounded service members through sports, and highlights ongoing international support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The science fiction concept of a universal translator is moving closer to reality as major tech companies like Apple, Google, and Meta race to perfect real-time language translation technology. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate spoken Spanish into English for the listener nearly instantaneously. This follows similar advancements from Google, whose Pixel phones can translate calls while preserving the speaker's vocal inflections, and Meta's Ray-Ban glasses. The rapid progress, fueled by generative AI, is turning language translation into a key competitive battleground for the world's leading technology firms.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is creating a noticeable ripple effect in the apparel industry, dubbed the "Ozempic effect." Clothing resellers are reporting a significant influx of larger-sized clothing, reversing the historical trend where such sizes were scarce and in high demand. In response, some retailers are reportedly stocking fewer extended sizes in stores, shifting them to online-only offerings. While the demand for inclusive sizing remains, the focus is shifting from the largest sizes (5-6XL) to a slightly smaller range (3-4XL), prompting brands that cater to big and tall customers to adjust their inventory strategies.</p>

          <p>Julia Fenner, a UK-Belarus dual citizen and wife of a British diplomat, has been released from a Belarusian prison as part of a larger deal negotiated between the United States and Belarus. Fenner was one of 52 political prisoners freed in exchange for the U.S. easing some sanctions on Belarus's national airline. She had been detained in March 2024 and was serving a long sentence on charges related to extremist activity. The UK's Europe Minister, Stephen Doughty, hailed the release as "great news" and a "significant breakthrough," thanking the U.S. for its diplomatic efforts, though over 1,000 political prisoners reportedly remain incarcerated in Belarus.</p>

While Bayindir has made some costly mistakes in recent games, Amorim is sticking with him for the crucial match. However, the coach also praised the newly arrived Lammens, stating that the young Belgian has "great potential to be our goalkeeper for a number of years," signaling a focus on future options.</p>
