          <p>President Trump has initiated the controversial demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to construct a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom. This project coincides with significant foreign policy developments, including efforts to expedite the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia to counter Chinese influence. Trump is also preparing for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC summit, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have led to new tariffs. The week also saw diplomatic engagements with NATO and Ukraine, highlighting a busy period for the administration.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard VOO ETF, may be losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated in the technology sector, which now accounts for a record 35% of the index's weight. Consequently, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index outperforming the S&P 500 in recent months. This potential market broadening comes as major tech companies are scheduled to report their latest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU is actively working to end its strategic reliance on rare earth elements imported from China. Beijing's recent export curbs on these critical materials, which are essential for manufacturing everything from electric vehicles to military technology, have caused significant economic damage to some European industries. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, boosting domestic production and processing, and significantly increasing recycling efforts. Von der Leyen emphasized that Europe must strive for greater independence in critical sectors.</p>

          <p>A year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is experiencing a remarkable and rapid ecological recovery, inspiring river restoration movements globally. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water quality has improved, and native wildlife is returning to the revitalized ecosystem. To mark the milestone, a group of 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the free-flowing river in more than 100 years. Their journey symbolizes a new beginning and serves as a powerful example of successful environmental stewardship.</p>

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest residences, holds a unique place in American history, located just blocks from the White House. Completed in 1801, it temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison after the White House was burned during the War of 1812, and it was where he signed the treaty ending the war. The house is also known for its reported paranormal activity, with tales of ghostly presences, including that of Dolley Madison, experienced by visitors over the years. Now a museum, the building is undergoing renovations to preserve its rich architectural and historical legacy.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a comfortable 26-6 victory over England in the first Rugby League Ashes match to be held since 2003. The game, played at Wembley, saw the Kangaroos demonstrate superior quality and control, particularly in the second half. A standout performance from full-back Reece Walsh, who scored two tries, highlighted the difference between the two sides. Despite a strong defensive effort, England struggled to break through the Australian line, with their only try coming as a late consolation. The series now moves to Liverpool, where England faces the challenge of reversing a three-decade losing streak against Australia.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. While votes were still being counted, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister known for her outspoken views. Her victory is seen as a win for a coalition of left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin and the Labour Party. As president, Connolly will serve in a largely ceremonial role, succeeding Michael D.

This narrative, released after the Communist Party's fourth plenum, is designed to highlight Xi's deep involvement and central authority in shaping China's long-term economic and strategic direction.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new bionic robot that mimics a jellyfish, designed for stealthy underwater surveillance and monitoring. Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is small, lightweight, and made from a transparent hydrogel material that makes it difficult to detect. Its design allows for near-silent operation and low power consumption, making it ideal for tasks such as observing fragile marine ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and conducting covert monitoring. The robot's lifelike appearance and movements represent a significant advancement in biomimetic underwater technology for scientific and potentially military applications.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his mansion in Hunts Point, Seattle, for $63 million, making a significant profit on the property he purchased in 2019 for $37.5 million. This move comes as Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez, have been living primarily in Miami for the past two years. The sale coincides with Bezos gradually reducing his ownership stake in Amazon to below 10%, having sold over 100 million shares in the last year. These financial decisions occur alongside an ongoing legal dispute where Bezos is seeking to have his wife's brother cover legal fees from a past defamation lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advises parents on how to say "no" to children in a way that builds connection rather than conflict. The key is to turn boundaries into teachable moments by explaining the reasoning behind them, particularly concerning safety and kindness. Providing children with limited choices can empower them and give them a sense of control, which often leads to greater cooperation. Consistency is crucial, as it helps children feel secure and understand expectations, even when they are upset. The article emphasizes that setting firm but caring limits is a vital skill for raising emotionally regulated and resilient children.</p>
