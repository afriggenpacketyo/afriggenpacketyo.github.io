The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report highlights a 50% decline in outdoor play in England due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies and opening school playgrounds to the community outside of school hours. The commission also suggests raising the digital age of consent to 16 and banning phones in schools.</p>
