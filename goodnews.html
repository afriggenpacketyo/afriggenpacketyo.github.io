          <p>China's electric vehicle market is experiencing a fierce price war, yet startup Xpeng has maintained strong sales, delivering over 34,000 cars in June. In contrast, rivals like Nio and Li Auto showed more modest or declining figures, while market leader BYD continued its dominance with over 377,000 vehicles sold. The intense competition is also pressuring foreign brands, with Tesla facing reduced sales and new challenges from entrants like smartphone maker Xiaomi. This market dynamic reflects what Chinese officials have called disorderly competition within the rapidly growing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the Quad, have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The partnership aims to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the processing and refining of minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies. The joint statement highlighted concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling blocks a plan by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end the program for Haitians in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, a young woman who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to local water contamination. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony before lawmakers was a driving force behind the bill, which serves as her legacy in public health protection.</p>

While some former players questioned his commitment, Pulisic has been reconnecting with the sport's roots by participating in youth soccer events.
