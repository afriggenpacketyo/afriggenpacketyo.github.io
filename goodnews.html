        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle, President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom has pivoted to focus on business and geopolitical matters. Trump is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his country residence, Chequers, for talks centered on refining the U.S.-U.K. trade deal and addressing ongoing global conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The visit has already been marked by the announcement of £150 billion in U.S. investment into the U.K., aimed at boosting jobs and economic growth. Despite their different political backgrounds, the surprisingly amicable relationship between Trump and Starmer has been a notable feature of the diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported highly positive results from a late-stage trial of its oral semaglutide pill, a tablet version of its popular weight-loss injection, Wegovy. The study demonstrated an average weight reduction of 16.6% in participants after 64 weeks, an efficacy level comparable to the injectable form. This development is a significant step toward providing patients with a needle-free alternative for obesity treatment, potentially broadening access and appeal. The company's stock rose over 5% following the announcement, as it positions itself against competitors like Eli Lilly in the rapidly growing market for oral weight-loss medications.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team has received a significant boost as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is set to return for the World Cup semi-final match against France. The reigning World Player of the Year has successfully completed concussion protocols after an injury sustained during a pool-stage game against Australia two weeks ago. Her return, along with that of prop Hannah Botterman, strengthens the squad for what is expected to be their most challenging match of the tournament. England is currently on a 16-game winning streak against France, but their last encounter in the Six Nations was a narrow 43-42 victory.</p>

          <p>A new nonprofit organization, the Safety and Prosperity Oversight Coalition, has been launched with the goal of promoting conservative values and ensuring accountability within government and the private sector. Led by veteran Republican political operative Chris Zeller, the group aims to become a leading voice for transparency and efficiency. The coalition will focus on scrutinizing government spending, addressing misconduct, and advocating for reforms through independent audits, legal challenges, and public education campaigns. This initiative is seen by some as a conservative effort to counter left-leaning watchdog groups and hold major institutions accountable from a right-of-center perspective.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor has revised its full-year financial forecast, lowering its expected operating profit margin from a range of 7-8% down to 6-7%, citing the impact of ongoing U.S. tariffs. The announcement came ahead of the company's CEO investor day in New York, where it also reaffirmed ambitious long-term sales growth targets. The event takes place at a challenging time for the automaker, which is also dealing with the aftermath of a major immigration raid at a jointly owned battery plant in Georgia. That raid resulted in the arrest of hundreds of workers, including many from South Korea, over suspicions of unlawful immigration status.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced that it has secured £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. firms, a development timed to coincide with President Donald Trump's state visit. The investments, which include major pledges from companies like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google, are expected to create over 7,600 jobs and deepen economic ties between the two nations. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deals as a testament to Britain's economic strength. However, the announcement comes amid challenges in other sectors, with some pharmaceutical giants halting U.K. investment plans and a proposed deal to cut U.S. steel tariffs being shelved.</p>

          <p>The Italian protest song "Bella Ciao," recently brought into focus after being found etched on a bullet casing related to the Charlie Kirk assassination, has a long and complex history as a global anthem of resistance. While widely associated with Italy's anti-fascist partisans during World War II, its origins are debated, with links to both early 20th-century klezmer music and protests by female rice paddy workers. The song's simple, catchy melody and adaptable lyrics have allowed it to be adopted by diverse movements worldwide, from leftist activists and feminist groups to climate protesters. Its recent resurgence in pop culture, notably through the Netflix series "Money Heist," has introduced it to a new generation.</p>
