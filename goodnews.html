        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing increased sales to home professionals that offset decreased demand from do-it-yourself customers. CEO Marvin Ellison credits investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating near-term uncertainty and housing market challenges. While first-quarter sales slightly missed expectations, earnings surpassed estimates, and the company anticipates comparable sales to be flat to up 1% for the year. Lowe's is diversifying its imports to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs, with only about 20% of its purchase volume currently originating from China.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a National Parking Platform (NPP) to simplify paying for parking across different car parks. Currently in the trial phase and set to be handed over to an industry body for expansion, the NPP allows drivers to use any major parking app at participating locations, eliminating the need to download multiple apps. The RAC welcomes this initiative, emphasizing the importance of broad adoption by car park operators. The trial phase involved 10 local authorities and facilitated over half a million transactions, aiming to create a more flexible and hassle-free parking experience for motorists.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose's shares experienced a significant surge after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, although it withdrew its fiscal year 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade and consumer spending patterns as reasons for not providing a financial outlook. The company said that the vast majority of its products are not impacted by tariffs, and it remains confident in its brand strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions. Canada Goose is also expanding into non-winter categories, such as rain jackets and warm-weather clothing, to strengthen the brand's year-round relevance.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed farm minister Taku Eto after a controversial remark regarding rice prices caused public outrage. Eto stated he receives so much rice from supporters that he doesn't buy any, which was viewed as insensitive amidst rising rice prices. Shinjiro Koizumi has been appointed as the new agriculture chief in an attempt to regain public trust. The gaffe occurred shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year.</p>

          <p>This article addresses concerns and questions surrounding President Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer. Despite having access to top medical care, the cancer went undetected, leading to questions about screening protocols for men over 70. Guidelines suggest that routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests may not be beneficial for older men due to slow-growing cancers and potential side effects from treatment. While Biden's prognosis is relatively good with modern treatments, the diagnosis highlights the ongoing debate about the necessity and frequency of prostate cancer screenings.</p>
