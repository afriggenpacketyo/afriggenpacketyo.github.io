          <p>OpenAI has launched its new GPT-5 model, which it describes as its most intelligent and useful AI system to date, featuring a "thinking" function and expert-level capabilities. However, the launch has received mixed reviews in China, where the AI landscape is increasingly competitive. Some Chinese tech experts have criticized the new model for its lack of revolutionary breakthroughs and memorable features, highlighting the intense global race for AI dominance. The article suggests that while advanced, GPT-5 may not be the game-changer some anticipated in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the construction of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic infrastructure project aimed at connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. The new line will link Hotan to Shigatse, creating a nearly 2,000-kilometer route that enhances connectivity across the Tibetan plateau. This railway is part of a broader plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer high-plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. The project also includes diversified business operations like real estate and tourism, signaling significant economic and strategic ambitions.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, a popular summer astronomical event, is expected to be less spectacular this year during its peak on August 12-13. A full moon will coincide with the peak, its brightness likely washing out the view of most meteors, according to NASA. Originating from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, the Perseids are known for bright fireballs and long wakes. Astronomers suggest that while ideal conditions are absent, patient observers in the Northern Hemisphere might still catch a few bright meteors in the predawn hours.</p>

          <p>This opinion article supports President Trump's nomination of Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, portraying him as an exceptionally qualified and principled constitutionalist. The author, a former colleague, highlights Tung's prestigious academic background and clerkships for Justices Gorsuch and Scalia as evidence of his legal brilliance. The piece criticizes Democratic senators for what it calls partisan attacks during his confirmation hearing, focusing on the author's social media posts rather than Tung's own record. The author urges the Senate to confirm Tung to uphold a conservative judicial legacy on the court.</p>

          <p>The 12,000-year-old archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey remains a profound mystery, with scientists continually adjusting theories about its purpose as a temple or social hub. This uncertainty has made it a fertile ground for conspiracy theories, popularized by figures like Graham Hancock and podcaster Joe Rogan, who suggest it was built by a lost civilization. Archaeologists leading the excavation push back against these claims, explaining that their slow, methodical work is essential for preservation and proper scientific analysis. The site highlights the tension between scientific inquiry and popular, unsubstantiated narratives.</p>

          <p>This article presents a financial analysis arguing that Palantir Technologies is significantly overvalued compared to its peers, ASML and AMD. It suggests that if Palantir's valuation corrected to a level more in line with its earnings, its market capitalization would fall below that of both ASML and AMD within three years. The author notes that these two companies are more reasonably priced and poised for respectable growth. However, the piece also acknowledges that Palantir's strong investor following could allow it to defy traditional valuation metrics for some time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>North Korea Begins Dismantling Propaganda Loudspeakers at Border</h2>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops dismantling propaganda loudspeakers along the shared border, a significant reciprocal gesture aimed at easing tensions. This action follows South Korea's decision in June to halt its own anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, which included K-pop music and news reports. The move signals a shift in inter-Korean relations under South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, who has prioritized reopening dialogue with the North. These cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. Sesko, who has signed a five-year contract, is the club's third major attacking acquisition this season, following Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Known for his electrifying pace and physical dominance, Sesko was a top goalscorer under 23 in Europe's major leagues. His arrival raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund, whom the club is reportedly willing to sell.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to mainland Italy. The proposed single-span suspension bridge would be the world's longest, with an estimated cost of €13.5 billion. Proponents tout the economic benefits and job creation, while critics and local residents raise concerns about the cost, environmental impact, and feasibility in a seismically active area. The project's success hinges on overcoming significant engineering challenges, financial hurdles, and local opposition that have plagued it for decades.</p>

          <p>European destinations are experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission, Chinese tourists are showing a strong preference for long-haul travel to the continent over other destinations. The article suggests this trend could be partly influenced by the political climate, as it questions whether former President Trump's policies and rhetoric may have inadvertently made Europe a more attractive option for Chinese travelers. This influx is providing a welcome boost to Europe's tourism sector.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who famously commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and guided it safely back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. In 1970, an explosion crippled his spacecraft on its way to the moon, forcing an aborted lunar landing and a desperate fight for survival that captivated the world. Lovell was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, making him the first person to journey to the Moon twice, though he never landed on it. NASA praised him for turning a "potential tragedy into a success," cementing his legacy as a national hero.</p>
