          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met in Ottawa, signaling a potential reset in relations after nearly two years of tension. The dispute arose from allegations of New Delhi's involvement in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh separatist. Modi expressed hope for renewed cooperation with Ottawa. The meeting represents a significant step toward mending the strained relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a significant bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a major win for the crypto industry. The bill sets guardrails, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and grants broad authority to the Treasury Secretary. It also restricts non-financial tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins to prevent monopoly concerns. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the bill, accusing Republicans of enabling Trump's crypto corruption, while others lauded it for enabling responsible innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. This system has led to unusual alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a particular candidate from winning. The New York City Board of Elections will provide preliminary totals for first-choice votes on election night, but full results will be reported a week later due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>
