          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a longtime Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1. Hartung, known for his disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances during the Covid-19 pandemic, will also join Tesla's audit committee. This addition expands Tesla's board to nine members as the company faces challenges including declining EV sales and concerns about CEO Elon Musk's focus on his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency. The SEC filing also noted that Hartung's son-in-law is a service technician for the EV maker.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced in a memo that the central bank plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years. This reduction will involve offering voluntary deferred resignation programs to employees eligible for retirement by the end of 2027. Powell stated that the move aims to consolidate functions, modernize practices, and ensure the Fed is appropriately sized to meet its statutory mission. The Fed's 2023 annual report indicated a staff of just under 24,000, so a 10% reduction would bring the total below 22,000 employees.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill hit a snag when conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Republicans have yet to resolve disputes, with conservative members seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Conservatives argue the bill does not sufficiently slash federal spending, particularly regarding Medicaid work requirements. Trump urged Republicans to unite behind the bill, which extends tax cuts from his first term and enacts new ones, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Epic Games announced that its popular game "Fortnite" will be unavailable on Apple devices due to Apple blocking its recent app update.

Epic Games' CEO had previously stated that "Fortnite" would return to the App Store if Apple extended the court's tax-free framework globally. Apple stated that it requested Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront to avoid impacting "Fortnite" in other regions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has transitioned into a prominent figure in Washington, holding positions on multiple corporate boards and advisory committees. Since his father's election, Trump Jr. has leveraged his influence in companies that sell handguns, make drones, and offer healthcare services online. He co-founded the exclusive private club, "Executive Branch," charging a substantial membership fee.

          <p>An article discusses the growing entitlement of elite golfers, particularly in their interactions with the media, and the risk of alienating the golfing public. Instances such as Collin Morikawa's refusal to speak to the media after a loss and Scottie Scheffler's dictating of questions highlight this trend. The article argues that while golfers enjoy a privileged lifestyle, they should remember that their success is partly due to public interest in the sport. The schism in elite golf has already turned the public away from the elite game, and these behaviors could further exacerbate the issue.</p>

Despite these recent increases, HELOCs remain relatively affordable compared to alternatives like personal loans and credit cards.

          <p>While there are no laws forcing individuals to pay credit card bills, legally stopping payments has significant consequences. Credit card debt is unsecured, but creditors can pursue legal avenues to recover unpaid balances, leading to damaged credit, collection activity, and potential lawsuits. Before stopping payments, consider options like hardship programs, credit counseling, debt settlement, or bankruptcy. Consulting with a debt relief expert can provide structured ways to manage or eliminate debt without risking long-term financial fallout. (not investment advice)</p>
