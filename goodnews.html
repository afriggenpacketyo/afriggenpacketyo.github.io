          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, bypassing credit bureaus. This move, aimed at eliminating markups, caused FICO's stock to surge over 20%, its largest single-day increase since November. The change is seen as a potential disruption to the business models of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose shares fell following the news. Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte praised the move as a creative solution for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential blackout of NBCUniversal channels for nearly 10 million YouTube TV customers has been averted after the two companies reached a new distribution agreement. The previous deal had expired, but talks continued, successfully resolving a dispute over fees and programming terms. A key point of contention was YouTube TV's initial demand to include content from NBC's Peacock streaming service at no extra cost, a proposal NBCUniversal rejected. The resolution ensures popular channels and major sports programming will remain available on the platform.</p>

The government's investment was funded through grants from the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed at bolstering domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The stock's recovery is also supported by other major investments from entities like Softbank and Nvidia, signaling renewed confidence in the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts, the cost of borrowing against home equity has decreased compared to earlier in the year. A $90,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now carries an average monthly payment of about $871, down from around $886 in February. While this makes borrowing more affordable, homeowners are advised to proceed with caution, as their home serves as collateral for the loan. The article suggests that homeowners should also compare these rates with those for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) before making a final decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team from Purdue University is planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate whether an underwater object is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost airplane. Researchers identified the "Taraia Object" in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island using satellite imagery, noting it has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team believes there is "very strong" evidence it is the famed aviator's Electra 10E aircraft. If confirmed, the university hopes to recover the plane, which was originally funded by the Purdue Research Foundation.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have made large home loans more affordable than they were at the start of the year. For a $700,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment at the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% is approximately $4,351. This represents a savings of about $273 per month compared to January's average rate of 6.93%, which translates to nearly $100,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan.
