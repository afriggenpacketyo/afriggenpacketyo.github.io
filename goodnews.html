          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates to escape from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, was captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff, culminating a multi-agency manhunt involving federal and local authorities. His apprehension brings a significant sense of relief to victims, their families, and the New Orleans community, who had expressed considerable concern over a convicted violent offender evading justice for months. Groves, who was awaiting a life sentence for second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in four killings, now faces additional charges for the jailbreak and is expected to be extradited to Louisiana. This incident critically highlighted severe design flaws and staffing deficiencies at the 2015-built facility, prompting officials to pursue every legal avenue against Groves and anyone who aided his escape.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares jumped 13% after the Japanese conglomerate announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB, further expanding its footprint in artificial intelligence. This strategic move aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI," aiming to merge Artificial Super Intelligence with robotics to drive groundbreaking evolution. The acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. SoftBank, which already owns chip designer Arm and holds a significant stake in OpenAI, continues to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI industry through key investments and acquisitions.

The incident occurred around 7:30 a.m., involving Ventura County Line Train 104 carrying 85 passengers. Metrolink's safety, security, and compliance department has launched an investigation into the cause of the collision. While the impacted trains were intended for other lines, leading to cancellations, a spokesperson noted that the operational impact was not severe due to frequent train services. This accident highlights the importance of ongoing safety protocols in public transportation systems.</p>

This decline occurred despite the party's most successful general election in terms of seats won last year. A party spokesperson highlighted their electoral gains, including a record number of MPs and more councillors than Labour or Conservatives in recent local elections. The Green Party, in contrast, has seen a significant surge in its membership during the same period, reaching 90,000 members. This trend prompts questions about the dynamics of political party engagement in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the first phase of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line in Gaza. This development, hailed by Trump as a "GREAT Day" for the region, was confirmed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas, and Qatari mediators. The agreement is expected to be approved by Israel's cabinet and could see hostages released within days. While procedural details remain, this marks a significant breakthrough in efforts to end the two-year-long conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recently unveiled 20-point peace plan aims to end the Israel-Hamas war, calling for an immediate ceasefire, Hamas's release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and Israel's phased withdrawal from parts of Gaza. The proposal also outlines a demilitarized Gaza governed by a "technocratic" Palestinian committee and an "International Stabilization Force" backed by the U.S. and Arab states. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed the plan, Hamas has yet to fully respond, though initial indications were positive. The plan also addresses aid delivery, economic development, and hints at a future pathway to Palestinian self-determination, though it sidelines the Palestinian Authority.</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff of Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, New York, successfully revitalized a persistently dangerous and declining school by integrating debate into every class and expanding the debate team. A decade ago, the school faced drastic enrollment decline and poor academic performance. However, Honoroff's innovative approach led to a dramatic transformation, with proficiency scores soaring to 60% in English and 70% in math. The school's debate team achieved national recognition, winning the middle school policy debate championship, demonstrating how critical thinking and verbal skills can empower students and foster a deep sense of community pride.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast, dipping below the Category 1 threshold with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. The storm continues to bring high surf conditions and gusty winds to Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. Priscilla's center is forecast to move parallel to the coast through Thursday, remaining offshore, with further weakening expected over the next 48 hours. Forecasters warn that large swells generated by Priscilla will affect coastal areas, likely causing life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism during arguments in a case challenging Illinois voting regulations, particularly the rule allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day. Republican Rep. Michael Bost, who won his election, claimed harm due to a lowered margin of victory and extended staffing costs. However, justices questioned the basis of his standing, suggesting his arguments amounted to a policy disagreement rather than individual injury. The lively exchange highlighted concerns about opening federal courts to candidates with no real chance of winning, and the potential for federal courts to make prognostications about election outcomes.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst an uproar over books with sexual content and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who sued the county and its officials, claimed her First Amendment rights were violated, a claim the county denied, asserting her dismissal was performance-related. The settlement concludes her lawsuit against the county, though a separate case against three individuals who contested the books will proceed. Lesley expressed vindication, hoping the outcome sends a message to other library districts about upholding the First Amendment and combating discrimination in public entities.</p>

The White House press secretary stated that Trump would also have a planned meeting and remarks with troops during his visit. This checkup follows an April examination that included cognitive and cardiology tests, with a health report declaring him "fully fit." Recent public appearances have fueled speculation about the president's health, though Trump has dismissed rumors.

          <p>Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," has been officially added to California's list of statewide holidays, effective January 1, 2026, following Governor Gavin Newsom's signing of Assembly Bill 268. This recognition makes California the third state to observe Diwali, which marks the beginning of the new year in the Hindu lunar calendar and is celebrated by Hindu, Sikh, and Jain faiths. The new law allows community colleges and public schools to close, and state employees to take the day off. The move signifies growing cultural acknowledgment and provides an opportunity for broader celebrations across the state, including various festivals in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier is drawing increased calls for an England starting role after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut against Valerenga. Despite being one of the Women's Super League's most consistent defenders, with a record 71 consecutive appearances and leading in clearances and touches this season, Le Tissier has only eight international caps. While England coach Sarina Wiegman prefers her at right-back, injuries to key players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze present a strong case for Le Tissier's inclusion in the upcoming squad. Her club coach Marc Skinner praised her as an "incredible footballer" and a "rock" for United.</p>

Sana previously ran a makeshift school in Gaza for displaced children, teaching them English, math, and even survival skills amidst constant bombing.
