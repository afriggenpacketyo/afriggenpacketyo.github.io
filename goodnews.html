        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A controversial plan to sell over 600,000 acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a major Republican spending bill. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated the withdrawal was due to an inability to guarantee the land would only be sold to American families and not foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has issued an apology after a technical error led to thousands of Eurojackpot players being incorrectly informed they had won millions. The mistake was caused by a currency conversion error where winnings were multiplied by 100 instead of being divided. While no incorrect prize money was paid out, the company's CEO expressed deep regret for disappointing customers who had already begun making plans with their supposed winnings. The CEO has since announced her resignation following this and other recent technical issues at the company.</p>
