          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to prematurely end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 520,000 Haitian immigrants in the U.S. The judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security secretary acted unlawfully by not following the timeline and procedures mandated by Congress for reconsidering the TPS designation. This decision temporarily preserves the protections, which allow individuals from countries facing extraordinary conditions to live and work legally in the United States, from being terminated ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>Intel's new chief executive is reportedly exploring a significant change in the company's chip manufacturing strategy to better compete with rivals like TSMC. The potential pivot would involve ceasing to market its 18A process technology to new external customers and instead focusing resources on the next-generation 14A process. This move is part of a broader effort to revive the U.S. chipmaker and win contracts from major clients such as Apple and Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>
