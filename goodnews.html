          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further easing, emphasizing a data-driven approach to balance growth and inflation.

This action follows growing public outrage over sewage spills and rising bills, while water companies have awarded ¬£112m in bonuses to executives over the past decade. The regulator, Ofwat, can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, aiming to rebuild trust between the companies and their customers.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., other economies, particularly in Asia, are concerned about being overwhelmed by these low-cost goods. However, for economies struggling with inflation, this influx of cheap Chinese imports could provide some relief for consumers. Economists suggest that this situation may allow central banks to consider further rate cuts, balancing the need to lower living costs with the challenges of rising trade tensions.

The damaged vessel will be moved to a dry dock in a different shipyard for repairs, with leader Kim Jong Un calling for swift action. The effort to refloat the ship involved the use of aerostatic balloons attached to the hull. Analysts believe that if North Korea devotes similar resources to internal repairs, the warship could be ready for sea trials sooner than expected.</p>
