          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections after decades of dictatorship, utilizing a complex indirect voting system due to the displacement of millions and fragile infrastructure. The process involves appointed committees selecting an "electoral college" of 6,000 to 7,000 people, who then vote for 121 members of the new People's Assembly. While praised by some for its consultative phases and inclusion of women, the system faces significant criticism for granting the interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, the power to directly appoint another 70 members, raising concerns about the potential for manipulation and consolidation of power.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores the psychological state of "limerence," an intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of "person addiction" if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals, leading to anxiety. To break the cycle of unhealthy limerence, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and redirecting energy towards new personal goals to create a sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old sixth grader from Oakland, California, has created a noteworthy entry for NPR's annual Student Podcast Challenge. The podcast, titled "Monster Madness," is a delightful and well-researched exploration of the lore surrounding Bigfoot. Created by Ryan Betts-Ng with help from his younger brother Marshall, the submission stood out to judges for its creative writing, original sound effects, and the joyful enthusiasm the brothers brought to the topic. The entry is highlighted as a gem among the thousands of submissions received from young people across the country.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their party conference, they face a strategic crossroads following significant gains in the last general election. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful, stunt-heavy campaign tactics successfully garnered media attention, polling suggests voters now see it as making the party look less serious. The party must decide whether to continue targeting moderate Conservative voters or expand its focus to other areas where the political landscape has been altered by the rise of Reform UK. The central challenge is how to define a substantive policy platform beyond stunts.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released and are returning to the UK. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades running a charitable training program. Their release was secured through negotiations brokered by Qatar, and they were reunited with their daughter in Doha before their flight home. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the reason for their detention, which their family said led to serious health issues.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are heavily favored in their upcoming World Cup semi-final against France, boasting a record 31-test winning streak. Despite England's statistical dominance, France has consistently been their toughest opponent, often closing the score gap in previous encounters. However, France enters the match significantly weakened by suspensions and injuries to key players. The French team hopes to overcome the odds and their 16-match losing streak against England to secure their first-ever appearance in a Women's Rugby World Cup final.</p>

          <p>The return to school has renewed the debate among parents about the utility and stress of class-wide WhatsApp groups. While these chats can be useful for sharing reminders about school events or organizing teacher gifts, many parents find them overwhelming and a source of anxiety. Common complaints include the high volume of notifications, the spread of polarized opinions on school policies, and displays of competitive parenting. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups entirely to reduce "background noise" and avoid the administrative burden, which often falls disproportionately on mothers.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in the Virginia gubernatorial election, a key contest viewed as a bellwether for the Trump administration's policies. The race pits Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. National issues, particularly the administration's cuts to the federal workforce, are playing a significant role in the state, which has a large number of federal employees. Spanberger is campaigning against these policies, while Earle-Sears is aligning herself with the economic record of the state's popular outgoing Republican governor. (not investment advice)</p>
