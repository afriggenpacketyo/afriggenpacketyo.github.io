          <p>Chinese researchers from Tsinghua and Beihang universities have engineered the world's smallest and lightest wireless robot, which can morph its shape for both land and air travel. Inspired by Lego, the microrobot utilizes a "morphable actuator" to convert energy into force, making it suitable for complex environments such as disaster rescue operations. According to the research team, this new actuator design could also be applied to create medical devices and components for virtual and augmented reality, showcasing its versatility. Study author Zhang Yihui noted that their robot has the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese goods, experts believe that Temu and Shein will continue to be dominant forces in the U.S. e-commerce market. The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. However, e-commerce and supply chain experts suggest that the companies are agile and have contingency plans in place, such as accelerating localization strategies and onboarding goods from American sellers. Deborah Weinswig, CEO of Coresight Research, believes that America's e-commerce game has been accelerating in favor of Temu and Shein.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the company reported a lower-than-feared decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty. The high-end German retailer reported a 2% revenue decline on a currency-adjusted basis, totaling 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), slightly surpassing the 979 million euros forecast by analysts. Weaker sales were attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to uncertain consumer outlook. CEO Daniel Grieder stated that the company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and remains vigilant in light of elevated uncertainties, including current tariff discussions.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Champions League fate may hinge on which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face when they play Paris St-Germain. The article questions whether Arsenal will face the shot-stopper extraordinaire or the error-prone flapper. Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, and it probably does not help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign. His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.</p>
