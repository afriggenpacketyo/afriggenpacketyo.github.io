          <p>Iran claimed responsibility for a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which occurred two days after the U.S. military struck three Iranian nuclear sites. Explosions were reported in Qatar, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard stated that it targeted the base with a "devastating and powerful missile" in an operation called "Annunciation of Victory." A U.S. defense official confirmed the attack, noting that there were no immediate reports of casualties as the Qatari government confirmed the strike, stating its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles and that there were no injuries. The White House and Department of Defense are monitoring the situation, and U.S. troops at the base are sheltering in place, as this event marks a significant escalation in Middle East tensions. The optimism score is based on the lack of reported casualties. </p>

Meta responded by stating that it strongly disagrees with the CAO's characterization, asserting that WhatsApp's encryption provides a higher level of security than many approved apps.

          <p>Super Micro Computer's stock experienced a decline after the company announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The offering is intended for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, with approximately $200 million allocated for repurchasing stock from note issuers. Despite the recent dip, Super Micro's shares have seen significant growth this year due to high demand for Nvidia's AI processors. Raymond James analysts highlighted Super Micro as a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure, noting that 70% of the company's revenue is attributable to AI. (not investment advice)</p>

The organization, founded in response to the U.S. military's Afghanistan withdrawal, has conducted over 7,000 rescues from high-risk areas. As the situation in the Middle East worsened, Project DYNAMO began extracting Americans, with approximately 700,000 Americans currently living in Israel, most of whom are dual nationals. The organization's model allows rescuers to evacuate approximately 1,000 individuals per week, addressing the perceived gap in government response. </p>

He affirmed the U.S.'s ability to destroy facilities thought to be indestructible and asserted that the U.S. has severely damaged Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons.

          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Wall Street's positive reaction to the U.S. bombings in Iran indicates that the oil-rich nation is less critical to the stock market than in the past. Despite initial volatility, oil prices decreased, and the S&P 500 increased, reflecting a dynamic where oil prices significantly influence the stock market during geopolitical tensions. Energy analyst Helima Croft noted that traders are seeking an off-ramp to the conflict, potentially viewing Iran's retaliatory attack as a sign of de-escalation. Cramer pointed to the rise in U.S. oil production as a reason for the measured market response. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon launched its second batch of Kuiper internet satellites into low Earth orbit, furthering its plans for a massive constellation to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The mission was rescheduled twice due to weather and a rocket booster issue. This launch marks a significant step in Amazon's effort to provide global internet connectivity through its Project Kuiper. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved Omnicom's $13.5 billion acquisition of Interpublic, but with the condition that the new company does not coordinate with others to steer ad dollars based on political content. The agreement allows individual advertisers to specify ad placements but prevents collusion with media watchdogs accused of orchestrating advertiser boycotts. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson emphasized that the settlement does not limit constitutionally protected free speech. The agreement requires the company to hand over related documents and file annual compliance reports for five years. </p>

          <p>Sampdoria will remain in Serie B after being awarded a 3‚Äì0 win over Salernitana following the postponement of Sunday's second-leg relegation play-off. The game was called off in the 65th minute with Sampdoria leading 2-0 on the night and 4-0 on aggregate after Salernitana fans threw smoke bombs and seats on to the pitch. The decision by Serie B's sports judge to award Sampdoria a 3-0 victory secured a 5-0 aggregate win and guaranteed their escape from what had seemed certain relegation to the third tier. Salernitana have been relegated for the second successive year and the club have also been ordered to play two matches of next season's Serie C campaign behind closed doors. </p>
