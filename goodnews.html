          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amidst trade concerns. The measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, and establish a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While these steps signal urgency in addressing economic challenges, analysts suggest their impact on boosting domestic credit demand may be limited. The government is also preparing additional measures to support small and medium enterprises and the private sector.</p>
