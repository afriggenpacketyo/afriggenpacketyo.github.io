          <p>The article discusses the likely components of the Labour Party's upcoming immigration crackdown, as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper prepares to unveil new plans aimed at reducing UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, particularly in the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions are expected to be tightened for nationalities deemed likely to overstay or claim asylum, with stricter screening for applicants from countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The article also mentions potential extensions to the waiting period for migrants seeking permanent residency and tougher English language requirements, along with a review of how the "right to family life" under the European Convention on Human Rights is applied in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, views the recent UK-US trade deal as a crucial step towards broader trade opportunities. The agreement reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by former President Trump on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) was discussed, Mandelson clarified that abolishing it was not part of the deal, leaving room for future negotiations. He also noted positive relations between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, emphasizing their shared commitment to defending national interests and fostering trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's agreement to lift tariffs on British steel exports to the United States has brought some relief to the struggling industry. The removal of the 25% tariffs is expected to boost demand for British steel in the U.S., benefiting companies like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield. However, uncertainties remain regarding tariffs on products processed in the European Union before being exported to the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies. While the deal is a positive step, the long-term stability of the British steel industry remains uncertain amid weak demand, foreign competition, and high energy costs.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods, Chinese companies are increasingly relocating their manufacturing operations to Vietnam. This shift allows them to bypass tariffs and maintain access to the U.S. market, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the transition. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a young workforce, challenges remain, including potential trade deals limiting China's use of Vietnam as a backdoor to the U.S. and increased costs for raw materials. Despite the challenges, many Chinese companies see Vietnam as both a short-term fix and a long-term solution to navigate the trade war.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing widespread cuts and layoffs at numerous federal agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting initiative. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the federal employee unions are likely to prove the administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from continuing layoffs or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The order will remain in effect for at least 14 days.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, though a representative for Swift denies her involvement in creative decisions for the film "It Ends With Us." The lawsuit stems from Lively's accusation of a smear campaign orchestrated by Baldoni, who counter-sued, alleging baseless accusations. Baldoni's team alluded to a famous friend of Lively and Reynolds pressuring him to accept changes to the script. Swift's spokesperson stated her only involvement was licensing her song "My Tears Ricochet" for the film.</p>
