          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following an announcement of a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military support for Ukraine by moving existing U.S.-made weapons currently deployed in Europe. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to take a stronger stance against Russia, including supporting legislation for heavy sanctions. The plan represents a significant development in U.S. policy, seeking to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities while navigating complex geopolitical and domestic pressures.</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured his second stage victory of this year's Tour de France, winning stage nine in a dramatic sprint finish. The win came after a valiant breakaway attempt by Mathieu van der Poel was caught just one kilometer from the end of the 174.1km route. Van der Poel's effort nearly disrupted the expected sprinter-friendly stage, but Merlier ultimately powered past his rivals to claim the victory. The general classification remains unchanged, with defending champion Tadej Pogacar holding a significant lead over his main competitors heading into the mountainous stages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move for player welfare, FIFA has reached an agreement with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods for professional footballers. The consensus includes a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a mandatory three-week rest period at the end of each season. This agreement comes after concerns were raised about player burnout and injury risk, particularly with the expansion of competitions like the 32-team Club World Cup. While seen as a major victory for players, the agreement also acknowledges the need to balance club and international fixtures.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions with China disrupt supply chains for rare earth metals, the recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) is emerging as a critical alternative source for the U.S. Traditionally overlooked, next-generation recyclers are now innovating ways to extract valuable materials like copper, gold, and critical rare earths from discarded electronics. This trend is driven by unpredictable trade policies and the need to onshore production of vital components for technology, from consumer devices to military hardware. This growing industry presents an opportunity to create a more localized and secure supply chain for essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that combines DNA analysis with family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for solving cold cases. The method gained prominence with the capture of the Golden State Killer, who was identified by amateur sleuth Barbara Rae-Venter using public genealogy databases. Law enforcement agencies are now increasingly adopting this technique to identify suspects in decades-old crimes, including murders and sexual assaults, by building family trees from crime scene DNA. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, it has also brought long-awaited justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has bolstered its security protocols with new technology. The agency has implemented a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement. These changes address critical failures identified from the Butler incident, where the shooter flew a drone undetected and communication between agencies was fragmented. The upgrades are part of a broader effort to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that allowed the attack to occur.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will take steps to make electric cars cheaper for consumers to buy. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she pointed to upcoming announcements and a new £25 million package for councils to install charging solutions for homes without driveways. The move aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption for many families. The government is under pressure to meet its targets for phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, but critics argue more needs to be done.</p>
