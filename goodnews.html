          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during an interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur has reignited discussions about his physical and mental fitness for office. The recording, documenting a portion of Hur's investigation into Biden's handling of classified information, captures the president's halting speech and memory lapses. Hur's report had previously described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," leading to renewed scrutiny of the president's cognitive abilities. The release of the audio comes amid new details emerging about Biden's mental and physical decline, prompting top Democrats to rationalize previous statements vouching for his fitness.</p>

          <p>Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, has introduced articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, alleging that the president has transformed American democracy into authoritarianism. Green claims that Trump has engaged in authoritarian rule, violated due process, denigrated federal judges, and disregarded court orders. This marks Green's second attempt to impeach Trump, following previous efforts during the president's first term. Green emphasizes that he is willing to stand alone in his opposition to Trump and encourages other members of Congress to vote according to their conscience.</p>

Key challenges include developing reliable propulsion systems, addressing radiation exposure, and ensuring life support. Musk's plan relies on Starship, the tallest and most powerful rocket ever built, which has undergone several test flights, including one that resulted in an explosion.

Trump issued an executive order directing his Cabinet to identify areas where coal-powered infrastructure can support AI data centers. While the tech sector acknowledges the need for fossil fuels in the short term, it prefers natural gas due to its lower carbon emissions. Some tech executives remain noncommittal regarding coal usage, citing the importance of energy availability and alternatives.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. This decline, the steepest single-year drop in 45 years, is attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, an opioid antagonist that can prevent death if administered promptly. Policies that have made naloxone available over the counter and provided telehealth access to addiction treatment have also contributed to the decline. Despite this progress, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution could hinder further progress.</p>

The government has urged firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's top-tier Prime Market to increase female executives to 30 percent or more by 2030.

          <p>President Trump suggested tariffs on foreign movies due to the American movie industry "DYING a very fast death". While the proclamation caused confusion, there is underlying panic that many American films are no longer made in America. The lack of protectionism could be why jobs have slipped away from Los Angeles. Gavin Newsom proposed a federal tax credit to motivate studios to create more work locally. There's no consensus on the best course of action to stimulate the film industry, and instead, Hollywood is busy reckoning with new alarmist proclamations.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from President Biden's 2023 interview with the Justice Department, which led Special Counsel Robert Hur to describe Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," have been published. The recordings reveal Biden's halting tone and difficulty remembering dates, particularly concerning the death of his son, Beau. The audio matches the transcript released by the Biden White House. The report concluded that Biden "willfully" retained government documents but recommended against criminal charges. Concerns about Biden's age and fitness for office have persisted since the report's release.</p>
