          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints regarding issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to resolve disputes and is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which has faced public anger over rising bills and environmental pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030. The reforms come as a new report from the Water Commission is expected to recommend significant changes to the industry's regulation.</p>

          <h2>New Mural at Dodger Stadium Honors Legendary Pitcher Fernando Valenzuela</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:12:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new mural immortalizing late Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, celebrating his enduring legacy nine months after his passing. Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his iconic pitching motion and is intended to symbolize unity within the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked the phenomenon known as "Fernandomania" and became a cultural hero, particularly for Latino fans. The mural serves as a vibrant tribute to the man who inspired a generation and helped connect the Dodgers with the city's Mexican-American population.</p>

          <p>Following his commanding victory at the Open Championship, Scottie Scheffler is drawing comparisons to a prime Tiger Woods from his fellow competitors. Peers like Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy expressed admiration for his sustained dominance over the past two years, with Schauffele noting it "sucks for us" to see his name on the leaderboard. Shane Lowry suggested that if Scheffler's swing looked more conventional, the Woods comparisons would be even more widespread. This win marks Scheffler's fourth major title in three years, solidifying his status as the undisputed top player in the world of golf.</p>

          <p>Despite winning his fourth major title and completing the third leg of a career grand slam, Scottie Scheffler humbly downplayed his achievement, stating he doesn't consider himself "anything special." After his dominant four-shot victory at Portrush, Scheffler reiterated that his family and faith are more important than golf, and that winning doesn't fulfill the "deepest desires" of his heart. He also dismissed comparisons to Tiger Woods as "silly," noting he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major championship total. Scheffler expressed joy at celebrating with his family, including his young son Bennett.</p>
