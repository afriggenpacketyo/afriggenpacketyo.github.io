          <h2>Montana Supreme Court Upholds Ruling Against State Abortion Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Montana Supreme Court has affirmed a lower court's decision that several state laws restricting abortion access are unconstitutional, including a ban beyond 20 weeks of gestation. This ruling reinforces the right to abortion in Montana, citing the state constitution's "right to be left alone," unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws also included restrictions on telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication, a 24-hour waiting period, and mandatory ultrasound viewing options. The Montana Family Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution, arguing that voters who registered on Election Day were denied the chance to fully review the initiative.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly engaging with the private sector, as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) consulted with tech industry leaders to gather input for Beijing‚Äôs next five-year development blueprint. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of the NDRC, emphasized the crucial role private enterprises can play in technological innovation, considering them a "key force in developing new quality productive forces." This move signals a more private-sector-friendly approach from the Chinese government, aiming to leverage the innovation and vitality of private companies. The 15th Five-Year Plan is expected to prioritize technology and innovation as engines for development, suggesting a focus on future-oriented industries.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has indicated that a takeover offer for Commerzbank is currently unlikely due to the German bank's prohibitively expensive share price. Despite UniCredit's 28% stake in Commerzbank and authorization to hold up to 29.9%, Orcel stated that an acquisition at a premium would not be a valuable investment for UniCredit's shareholders. Commerzbank's shares have surged 76% year-to-date, fueled by a broader rally of German equities and Berlin's relaxed fiscal rules. Orcel emphasized that UniCredit is far from a merger bid and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba intends to call on G7 nations to collaborate in addressing North Korea's cryptocurrency thefts during their upcoming summit in Canada. This initiative is driven by allegations that North Korea is using illicitly obtained virtual assets to fund its weapons development programs, necessitating stronger international cooperation. Japan also aims to enhance collaboration with European nations supporting Ukraine, given Pyongyang's strengthening military ties with Moscow. The G7 also plans to establish a task force to review tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving small parcels, addressing concerns about the influx of cheap goods and potential customs processing strains.</p>

Advocates of nuclear fusion believe it can play a key role in the energy transition, offering a virtually limitless source of clean, safe, and affordable energy.
