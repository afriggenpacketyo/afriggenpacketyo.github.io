          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illnesses, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows a previous study that analyzed the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies, reflecting a significant shift towards preventative healthcare through genetic screening.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months as the Trump administration attempted to deport him over "foreign policy" concerns. Upon his release, Khalil criticized the administration's actions, while officials defended the decision to detain him. The ACLU, representing Khalil, expressed relief that he would be reunited with his wife and newborn son, after a judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been "highly unusual." The case highlights ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and activism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve the conflict. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. The ruling comes amidst broader tensions between Harvard and the Trump administration, including demands for policy changes and threats to cut off funding.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed a bill that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports such bans, making Rhode Island the eleventh state with some form of prohibition on these firearms. The bill applies only to sales and manufacturing, not possession, aligning with Washington state's approach. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, with some gun control advocates calling the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>
