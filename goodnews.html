        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in the UK will now be encouraged to release the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases under new guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council. This change aims to counter misinformation and increase transparency, particularly in sensitive investigations that attract significant public interest. The move follows several controversial cases where the lack of official information led to widespread speculation and, in one instance, was linked to riots. The guidance reaffirms that verifying immigration status remains the responsibility of the Home Office, not the police.</p>

          <p>Following a market rally spurred by a favorable inflation report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain invested despite the current geopolitical and domestic political climate. He argued that investors who sell based on pessimism over issues like tariffs or White House personnel changes often miss subsequent market gains. Cramer suggested that while he may not agree with all of the administration's decisions, they are not a sufficient reason to exit the market, as corporations have proven adept at navigating the challenges and continue to generate strong profits.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions for immigrants held at an ICE facility in Manhattan's 26 Federal Plaza. The ruling requires ICE to reduce the number of detainees and provide essential items like sleeping mats, hygiene products, and access to medication and legal counsel. The order followed a lawsuit by the ACLU highlighting "inhumane" and unsanitary conditions, where detainees were held for days without beds or adequate meals. The judge's decision is a direct response to criticism over the treatment of individuals in the facility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates across the state. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous police jobs. The new law requires law enforcement agencies to conduct comprehensive reviews of an applicant's entire employment history, including disciplinary and performance records, before making a job offer. The measure aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being hired and to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities.</p>

          <p>A Union Pacific train with approximately 35 cars, many carrying hazardous materials, derailed over a railroad bridge in Palo Pinto County, Texas. The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon, causing a pile-up of mangled train cars and sparking a small grass fire that was contained by emergency crews. Officials are treating the site as a hazardous material situation, though they have reported no leaks from the derailed cars and no injuries. The cause of the derailment is currently under investigation by Union Pacific and local authorities.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell by 9% in extended trading, even after the company reported second-quarter revenue that more than tripled year-over-year and exceeded analyst expectations. The company, which rents high-demand Nvidia chips, also raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing that demand continues to outpace its supply capacity. Despite the strong performance and new high-profile clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, investors reacted negatively, possibly due to a registered net loss and an operating margin that shrank significantly due to stock-based compensation costs.

          <p>During his holiday in the Cotswolds, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held private meetings with senior Conservative politicians, including shadow home secretary Chris Philp and shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick. The meeting was reportedly initiated by Vance's team and marks the first time he has met with the two men, who share similar positions on issues like immigration and free speech. The vice president did not meet with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch due to scheduling conflicts. These discussions occurred alongside Vance's more official engagements, such as a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Wednesday. This call will take place just before Trump's in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. The pre-meeting with allies comes after Zelenskyy noted a "signal" from a U.S. envoy that Russia may be ready for a ceasefire, though he remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. The virtual conference appears to be an effort to coordinate with and reassure allies ahead of the high-stakes talks with the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that China's construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River, while causing anxiety in downstream nations like India and Bangladesh, could serve as a catalyst for improved water diplomacy. The project, aimed at generating clean energy and boosting regional development, is perceived by neighbors as a strategic move with significant geopolitical implications. Given the existing tensions over transboundary water sharing in South Asia, the author argues that China could use this project to build confidence. This could be achieved by establishing transparent water-sharing mechanisms and engaging in cooperative dialogue with India.</p>

          <p>Rangers have progressed to the final play-off round of the Champions League qualifiers, where they will face Club Brugge, but their performance has raised concerns. Despite advancing past Viktoria Plzen on aggregate, they lost the second leg 2-1 and relied heavily on goalkeeper Jack Butland and their opponent's poor finishing. Head coach Russell Martin expressed disappointment with his team's sloppiness, noting they conceded an alarming number of shots and struggled to maintain possession. While securing a spot in the next round is a success, the team will need significant improvement to reach the lucrative group stage.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce admitted in a recent interview that his on-field performance over the past two seasons has not met his own high standards. He suggested that his focus may have "slipped a little bit" due to his numerous off-field activities, including hosting television shows, acting roles, and his highly publicized relationship with Taylor Swift. Kelce, whose receiving yardage has declined, clarified that he doesn't regret the opportunities but feels motivated to return to his peak form for his team. The star player's admission reflects on the challenges of balancing a high-profile personal life with elite athletic performance.</p>
