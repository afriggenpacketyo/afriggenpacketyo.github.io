          <p>Comcast's Q2 financial results surpassed Wall Street forecasts for both earnings and revenue, driven partly by the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney. Despite this positive performance, the company experienced a significant loss of 226,000 broadband customers, highlighting ongoing challenges in the connectivity market. In contrast, its mobile division saw record growth, adding 378,000 new lines, while the theme parks and film studios also reported strong revenue increases. The company's streaming service, Peacock, saw its losses narrow considerably, though subscriber numbers remained flat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international scientific mission led by China has discovered extensive and thriving colonies of tubeworms and molluscs at depths of up to 9,500 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. This finding represents the deepest known chemosynthesis-based community on Earth, where life is sustained not by sunlight but by chemical reactions involving methane and hydrogen sulphide. The discovery challenges existing models of life at extreme environmental limits and deep-ocean carbon cycling. Researchers suggest that such hidden oases of life might be more common in the world's hadal trenches than previously believed.</p>

          <p>Following her 2024 election loss, Kamala Harris has announced she will not enter the race for governor of California, a decision that opens up the field for other Democratic candidates. In her statement, Harris acknowledged that government and institutions have often failed the American people, suggesting a need for "new methods and fresh thinking." While she did not rule out a future run for the White House, she stated her public service will not be in elected office for now. Allies believe this move allows her to engage more freely in political debates and focus on rebuilding the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, showed significant heart health benefits in a head-to-head clinical trial against its older treatment, Trulicity. The late-stage study found Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events and also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. While the results did not meet some analyst benchmarks for superiority, the company believes the data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients. Eli Lilly plans to submit the data to global regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada plans to officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the third G7 nation to announce such a move recently, following France and the UK. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the recognition is contingent upon the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the participation of Hamas. The decision marks a significant shift in Canadian foreign policy, prompted by the expansion of Israeli settlements and the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The move was rejected by Israel's foreign ministry but is part of a growing international diplomatic shift.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, is investigating four companies that operate a total of 34 pornography websites for potential non-compliance with new age verification rules. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, require sites with adult content to use effective tools to prevent children from accessing it. The targeted companies have a combined monthly viewership of over nine million visitors and were prioritized based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm. This move is part of a broader enforcement effort by Ofcom to make the internet safer for children.</p>
