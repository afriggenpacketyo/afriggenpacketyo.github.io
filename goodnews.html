          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and high antibody levels, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Facing limited options, her transplant cardiologist, Dr. Pareg Patel, proposed the innovative procedure to address her antibody issue and prevent organ rejection. The surgery was successful, and Baker became both a recipient of two organs and a donor, as her healthy liver was transplanted into another patient. Despite a long recovery, Baker's story has paved the way for similar surgeries and offered hope to other patients with complex conditions, though her financial situation has become unstable due to medical bills and funeral expenses following her husband's death. The article strikes a hopeful tone, emphasizing the success of the surgery and its potential to help others, even as it acknowledges the challenges Baker faces. </p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, marking a significant step in reducing reliance on foreign software in space technology. The microsatellite, equipped with OpenHarmony RTOS and a domestically produced chip, demonstrated improved data update speeds and stability compared to previous systems. Researchers from Dalian University of Technology conducted over 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing, leading to proposed national technical standards for OpenHarmony's use in small satellites. This development is seen as a response to US sanctions and aims to promote broader adoption of the operating system in commercial and research satellite missions within China. The article expresses a sense of progress and technological advancement in China's space program. </p>
