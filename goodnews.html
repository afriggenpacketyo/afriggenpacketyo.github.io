          <p>Following her resignation as CEO of the social media platform X, Linda Yaccarino briefly lost her blue verified checkmark. The checkmark, a symbol of a verified, premium account, was removed from her profile shortly after she announced her departure but was restored by the following evening. Yaccarino, who has remained active on the platform, has not provided a reason for leaving the company. The incident occurred a day after owner Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, posted antisemitic content.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products. The denim maker announced it will absorb some of the initial financial impact from the Trump administration's new tariffs, which are expected to cost the company $25 to $30 million for the remainder of the year. This decision is supported by robust sales, reduced promotions, and premium pricing on new items, particularly in its growing women's apparel category. The company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to return some migrants who arrive in the UK via small boats across the Channel. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK will send a number of migrants back to France in exchange for accepting an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the plan alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, stating it aims to break the business model of people smugglers. The initiative is part of a broader collaboration that also includes coordinated nuclear deterrents.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to launch its autonomous Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a key market currently dominated by its rival, Waymo. The company has applied with the Arizona Department of Transportation to conduct tests and operations, both with and without human safety drivers. This expansion follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where Tesla has been testing its camera-based automated driving system with invited passengers and a safety supervisor. The move signifies Tesla's push to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space and compete directly with established players.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the mandatory removal of shoes at airport security checkpoints is being framed as a form of "populism theater." For over two decades, the practice was a well-known example of "security theater," giving the appearance of vigilance without a clear, ongoing rationale. This article argues that the policy's removal, without a stated technological or intelligence breakthrough, serves as a populist gesture. It gives the general public a convenience previously reserved for those who paid for premium services like TSA PreCheck.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can go to trial. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X canceled a partnership for a new show just hours after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims including "fraud by false promise" and the existence of an "implied contract." Musk's legal team had attempted to have the case moved to Texas or dismissed entirely.</p>
