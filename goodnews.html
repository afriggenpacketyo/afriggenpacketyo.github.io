          <p>American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander was released from Hamas captivity after negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. The International Committee of the Red Cross facilitated the transfer of Alexander to Israeli authorities, and he was reunited with his family at Reim Military Base in Israel. Alexander, who was serving in the IDF when captured, was taken for a medical assessment and then to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. This article notes that Alexander's release is viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the Trump administration and a potential opening to jumpstart talks surrounding the broader conflict.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is urging California cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, framing it as a "statewide funding announcement" regarding mental health and homelessness issues. Newsom is releasing a model ordinance for cities to use as a basis for their own local ordinances against homeless encampments. The governor cites the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances and a 2024 executive order from his office as part of his call on cities to act. The effort is also being backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding.</p>

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level in April, totaling $16.3 billion, due to President Donald Trump's trade war. This influx in tariffs helped reduce the budget deficit for April, which totaled $258.4 billion. However, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.05 trillion. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander to Israeli forces as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal. Alexander, 21, had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023. Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. The release was intended as a goodwill gesture ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday.</p>
