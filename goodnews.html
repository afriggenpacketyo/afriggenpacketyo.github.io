        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After two days of negotiations in Geneva, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made "substantial progress" toward a trade agreement. While details remain limited, the agreement aims to address national security concerns related to China's trade practices, which the Trump administration views as a national emergency due to unbalanced trade. The U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, indicated that a "deal" had been reached, but it remains unclear whether tariffs will be reduced. The article notes the economic implications of the trade dispute, including disruptions to global supply chains, potential bankruptcies for American companies, and the slowing of global growth.</p>

          <p>Democrats are attempting to tap into parents' concerns by linking rising prices of baby gear and the spread of vaccine misinformation to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As families face skyrocketing costs of strollers and car seats due to tariffs and measles outbreaks linked to undermined vaccines, Democrats see an opportunity to persuade voters that the White House is making their lives harder. While Republicans have successfully tapped into parental emotions in the past, Democrats are hoping to channel parents' fury and fears by addressing issues such as safe sleep campaigns and trust in vaccination programs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar , which he will use as Air Force One , four sources familiar with the planning confirmed to NBC News.
