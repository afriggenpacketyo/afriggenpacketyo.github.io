          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, decreasing the one-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the five-year LPR to 3.5%. This move is part of a broader stimulus package aimed at boosting the Chinese economy amid trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The rate cuts came as state-backed lenders reduced deposit rates to protect their net interest margins. Despite near-term upside, Nomura cautioned of a potential "double whammy" from a housing slump and renewed U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reversed its decision and allowed construction to restart on the Empire Wind project off Long Island, following pressure from New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The project, worth $5 billion, is expected to power 500,000 homes in New York. The administration had previously halted the project, citing rushed permits, but provided no evidence to support the claim. Equinor, the company building the wind farm, had warned of potential cancellation due to the work stoppage.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art returned three ancient artworks to the Republic of Iraq, which were identified as looted during an investigation into an art dealer suspected of trafficking in stolen antiquities. The artifacts, including a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, were recovered following criminal investigations into looted art. The artifacts were returned in an official ceremony attended by Met officials and representatives from Iraq. The Manhattan district attorney's office said the investigation into Robin Symes led to the seizure of 135 antiquities valued at $58 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours. Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, called it a "national victory" to protect children from online exploitation. Critics, however, argue that the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship.</p>

          <p>The UK is now in a better place on trade "than any other country in the world," according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Britain's economic growth is expected to be upgraded due to recent trade deals with the US, India, and the EU. Reeves indicated that a trade pact with countries in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, would be the "next deal". While previously expressing interest in a long-term relationship with China, Reeves stated that the UK is "not looking to have trade negotiations with China."</p>
