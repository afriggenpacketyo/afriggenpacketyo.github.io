          <p>Silent book clubs are gaining traction as a social activity that allows individuals to enjoy reading in a shared space without the pressure of traditional book club discussions. Members gather, read silently for an hour, and then optionally discuss their chosen books. The concept originated in San Francisco and has since spread globally, offering a relaxing and mindful experience. The trend reflects a resurgence in people seeking third spaces for socializing outside of drinking or dating environments. Participants appreciate the social aspect combined with the freedom to read whatever they choose.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss AI's Potential to Widen Workplace Inequality</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are debating the impact of artificial intelligence on workplace inequality, with some fearing job displacement and the exacerbation of existing disparities. While AI is touted for increasing efficiency and productivity, concerns arise about potential job losses and ethical considerations, such as bias in AI algorithms. Some workplace leaders believe protecting employment might not be the right mindset, and that it's more about adapting employment. Companies are encouraged to equip employees with new skills to handle AI and create new employment opportunities. The rise of AI requires an "AI-first" mindset, while still keeping humans in the loop.</p>

          <p>China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign is targeting high-ranking officials within the People's Liberation Army (PLA), including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Analysts suggest that this crackdown should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. They believe that the campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is limited, and that internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. Recent investigations have led to the removal of key figures from their positions within the CMC and the Communist Party.</p>

          <p>The Vatican is preparing for the election of a new pope following the death of Pope Francis, with cardinals set to convene in the Sistine Chapel. The process involves a centuries-old tradition of signaling the election's outcome through smoke rising from a chimney. White smoke indicates the election of a new pope, while black smoke signifies no decision has been reached. The process requires carefully engineered stoves, precise chemical recipes, and Vatican firefighters on standby. The tradition is seen as a symbolic form of communication with the outside world while maintaining the confidentiality of the vote.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, where he upheld the constitutional transfer of presidential power. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force for Americans. His remarks came shortly after an interview aired in which Trump expressed uncertainty about whether everyone in the U.S. is entitled to due process. Pence highlighted his differences with both Democrats and his own Republican Party, particularly on issues such as spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its in-house beagle laboratory after facing criticism for its animal testing practices. The decision follows a report detailing alleged mistreatment of beagles in experiments. The White Coat Waste project praised the closure, emphasizing that taxpayers shouldn't fund such research. This move aligns with broader efforts to reduce animal testing, including the FDA's phasing out of animal testing requirements for certain drugs. PETA has praised the Trump administration for phasing out ‚Äòcruel tests on dogs‚Äô and other animals.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris expressed his view that Max Verstappen's racing was not very smart during the Miami Grand Prix. Norris was delayed in racing Verstappen because he passed him at Turn 11 by going off track and had to give the place back, before regaining it for good the following lap. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella suggested that Norris could have been more patient, but saw no difference in his two drivers' approaches to racing Verstappen. Once he passed Verstappen, Norris closed on Piastri in the second stint, but ran out of time to close the gap.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly in the Dodgers' loss to the Braves. Two poorly executed sweepers to Austin Riley resulted in two home runs. While May was largely effective outside of those pitches, the mistakes highlighted the importance of consistency for the pitcher. The Dodgers ultimately lost 4-3, despite a late comeback effort. May acknowledged the need for more consistency, particularly in executing his sweeper pitch.</p>
