          <p>The racing film 'F1 The Movie,' starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's biggest box office success, earning $55.6 million domestically and an additional $88 million internationally in its opening weekend. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, the big-budget film exceeded expectations and signals a potential turning point for Apple's theatrical film strategy. Despite the strong start, the movie's reported $200 million-plus budget means it still has a long way to go to become profitable.

          <p>The upcoming movie "Superman," directed by James Gunn, intends to present a more relatable and less indestructible version of the iconic hero. Actor David Corenswet, who takes on the role, explains the character's core struggle is loneliness and a desire to be part of humanity. Gunn notes that his Superman will be seen bleeding and is not all-powerful, a deliberate shift to create more grounded dramatic stakes. The film, which also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, aims to explore the character's inherent goodness as a form of rebellion in a cynical world.</p>

          <p>British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it does not intend to shut down its factory in Hethel, Norfolk. The meeting was prompted by reports that the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the United States, which would have threatened 1,300 jobs. Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to U.S. tariffs, but is preparing to resume as those tariffs are reduced.

          <p>The British government has announced new plans requiring supermarkets and food manufacturers to make it easier for customers to choose healthy food. Under the voluntary partnership, retailers will decide how to encourage healthier shopping, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. The initiative aims to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the NHS, with retailers reporting on healthy food sales to increase accountability. The opposition criticized the plan as a "nanny state" approach, arguing it is not the government's role to dictate consumer purchases.</p>
