          <h2>House Passes Bill to Raise 'SALT' Deduction Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 10:03:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Trump's tax package. The bill raises the SALT cap to $40,000, phasing out over $500,000, and increases it annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate, as the previous SALT deduction was unlimited before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pause on tariffs on Chinese goods has led to a boost in imports, but retailers still face potential shortages and higher prices, according to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey. While some companies are restarting stalled orders from Asia, many retailers report that existing tariffs remain too high to complete full orders, leading to lower inventory and fewer product selections for consumers. The survey indicates that the majority of respondents are not seeing a full restart in holiday orders, and concerns remain about available ocean freight space. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the coming months, with many focused on lower-priced goods due to low consumer spending optimism.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether seniors should invest in gold, considering its high price, and it suggests that gold can protect a portfolio rather than aggressively growing its value. Gold can act as a hedge against volatility and diversify exposure, especially important for retirees with shorter investment timelines. However, gold does not produce income like dividends or interest, and seniors should be cautious of buying at elevated prices due to the potential for a pullback. Alternative ways to invest in gold include fractional gold investing and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European airlines are grappling with aircraft shortages due to delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, despite strong demand for summer travel. EasyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis reported positive booking positions for the third and fourth quarters, but the ongoing capacity issue remains a concern for the industry. The British low-cost carrier reported a pre-tax loss for the first six months of the year, though current bookings suggest it will meet full-year profit expectations. This combination of high demand and limited aircraft availability poses challenges for airlines during the peak travel season.</p>
