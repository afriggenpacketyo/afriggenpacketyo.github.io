The US Secretary of Health announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate artificial colors by the end of 2026, citing potential health risks to children. Some companies have already begun transitioning to natural colors, while others face hurdles in replicating the vibrancy and stability of synthetic dyes.</p>
