        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long throw-in, a tactic famously used by Stoke City in the past, is making a comeback in the Premier League, with Brentford FC emerging as its modern masters. The team has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other team in the league. This success, highlighted by a recent goal against Chelsea, has prompted discussion among managers and pundits about the effectiveness and difficulty of defending this seemingly simple but chaotic set-piece. Brentford's coaching staff has intentionally embraced the tactic as a valuable tool for creating goal-scoring opportunities.</p>

          <p>Belfast boxer Lewis Crocker has been crowned the new IBF welterweight world champion after defeating Paddy Donovan by a split decision at Windsor Park. The fight was a hard-fought rematch, with Crocker scoring crucial knockdowns in the third and fifth rounds that ultimately swayed the judges. Despite Donovan's efforts, two of the three scorecards favored Crocker, marking a significant victory for the boxer who now holds an undefeated record of 22-0. The win serves as vindication for Crocker, who won their previous encounter by disqualification but was determined to prove his superiority in this bout.</p>

          <p>A recent memorandum of understanding between Hainan province and Hong Kong signals a new era of economic cooperation, according to this opinion article. Rather than viewing Hainan's development as a threat, the piece argues that the island's free trade port can complement Hong Kong's established financial system. Hong Kong's expertise in asset management, legal services, and risk management can provide the necessary structure and global connectivity for Hainan's growth. The partnership could also extend to tourism and other sectors, creating a powerful economic hub in southern China that enhances regional competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. His 15-year legal battle resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's colleagues remembered him as a visionary "armed with history" who fought tirelessly for educational equity and highlighted funding disparities faced by HBCUs nationwide. During his tenure from 1984 to 2010, he oversaw a period of significant growth at Morgan State, often referred to as "Richardson's Renaissance."</p>

          <p>In response to a historic drought that severely restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is launching major infrastructure projects to ensure future water security. The plans include a new dam and a "land bridge" featuring a pipeline to transport natural gas liquids, complementing the waterway and reducing reliance on rainfall for certain high-value products. These multi-billion dollar projects are critical for the global trade gateway, which handles a significant portion of U.S. container traffic, but they face a long timeline and will require the relocation of local communities. The investments aim to out-engineer the growing threat of climate change on canal operations.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and will now allow long-term refugees from Myanmar, living in border camps, to work legally in the country. This policy shift affects around 80,000 people, some of whom have been in the camps since the 1980s, and comes after significant cuts in U.S. humanitarian aid led to the cancellation of food rations. The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a "turning point" and a potential "regional benchmark" for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>

          <p>The Taliban have claimed that they reached an agreement with United States envoys on a prisoner swap during a recent meeting in Kabul. According to a Taliban statement, the talks with President Trump's special envoy for hostage response focused on normalizing relations and included a confirmation that an exchange of detainees would be undertaken. The Taliban did not provide details on the number or identity of the prisoners involved, and the White House has not yet commented on the claim. The meeting follows the Taliban's release of a U.S. citizen in March and comes amid criticism from the group over a new U.S. travel ban affecting Afghans.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed several significant and controversial bills that could reshape students' school experiences, now awaiting the governor's signature. One bill mandates a "science of reading" approach, emphasizing phonics, to address lagging literacy scores, despite opposition from some educators. Another bill aims to phase out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets and corn dogs from school cafeterias to improve student health. A third measure, born from concerns over antisemitism in ethnic studies, would create a state Office for Civil Rights to combat various forms of discrimination in schools, a move critics fear could chill classroom discussion.</p>
