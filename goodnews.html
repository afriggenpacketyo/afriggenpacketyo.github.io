          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. details her visit to a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting six categories of 'longevity foods' she wishes were more available in American stores. She was impressed by the incredible variety of traditional Japanese items, including diverse seaweeds, numerous soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal local produce. The article also notes the availability of healthy, ready-to-eat Japanese meals, traditional rice crackers, and a wide selection of green tea, all of which are staples in a diet associated with a long life.</p>

          <p>The emergence of AI-generated music acts, such as The Velvet Sundown which has over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, is causing a significant stir in the music industry. Platforms like Suno and Udio can create complete songs from text prompts, lowering the barrier to entry for music creation but also raising concerns about originality and human expression. Major record labels are responding with lawsuits over copyright infringement in AI training data, while human artists express frustration over competing with synthetic content. The debate highlights a fundamental shift in how music is created, distributed, and valued.</p>

          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Effort to Recall 24 Opposition Lawmakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 12:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political event, voters in Taiwan have rejected a bid to recall 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers, a move that deals a blow to President Lai Ching-te's ruling party. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups following controversial parliamentary reforms pushed by the KMT and its allies, which critics argued were too close to China's interests. The failure of the recall means the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not regain a majority in parliament, and the KMT has called on the president to cease political infighting and focus on governance.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogacar is poised to win his fourth Tour de France after safely navigating the penultimate stage, maintaining his significant overall lead. The final stage into Paris is traditionally processional, meaning his victory is all but guaranteed barring any unforeseen incidents. While Pogacar secured his position, Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever Tour stage win after a bold solo attack with 16km remaining. Groves' victory marks a career milestone, as he has now won stages in all three of cycling's Grand Tours.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway as former U.S. President Donald Trump visits his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. While Trump played golf, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to protest his visit, citing his political views and the cost to taxpayers. During his trip, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has raised questions about security costs and police resources, while also coinciding with a Scottish government funding announcement for a tournament at another of Trump's courses.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was notably absent from the team's friendly match against AC Milan, a decision manager Arne Slot confirmed was due to ongoing transfer speculation. The club recently rejected a £58m bid from Bayern Munich for the Colombian player, whose future at Anfield now appears uncertain. Slot stated that while Diaz is training well, the decision was made not to play him because of the "rumours around him lately." The move comes as Liverpool has already signed two new forwards this summer and is reportedly pursuing another, signaling potential changes in their attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>The failure of a mass recall vote against 24 opposition KMT lawmakers is being framed as a significant political setback for Taiwanese President William Lai and his ruling DPP party. Analysts suggest the campaign, which aimed to oust lawmakers viewed as "pro-China," was a miscalculation that backfired, exposing public fatigue with blanket "anti-China" rhetoric. The result ensures that Lai's party will continue to lack a parliamentary majority, complicating his administration's agenda. Beijing has continued its military pressure on the island since Lai took office, viewing his administration as pro-independence.</p>

Hurdles remain, but a recent meeting between the top diplomats of both nations was described as positive, an essential step before any potential summit between leaders.

This benefit is seen as a crucial tool for attracting and retaining talent, especially as millions of Americans grapple with significant student loan debt.

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album "Swag" has produced an unexpected hit, "Daisies," which has risen to No. 2 on the Billboard charts and offers a potential "song of the summer." The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. This downtempo yet intricate sound seems to resonate with the current cultural mood, which favors reserved, simmering music over high-energy anthems. The article suggests this trend reflects a collective sense of malaise or a hangover from a more hedonistic period in pop culture.</p>
