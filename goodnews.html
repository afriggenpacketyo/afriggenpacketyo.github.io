          <p>Volunteers at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, England, have discovered a sandstone carving depicting Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks by a couple who have volunteered at excavations for two decades. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, possibly adorning an ornamental arch and gate at the barracks, which were built in 213 A.D. The discovery highlights the grandeur and symbolism present in Roman forts and will be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth for his contributions to literature and his stance against Nazi rule. His works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," reflect his life spent navigating diverse worlds, particularly after fleeing Germany in the 1930s. Mann used his platform to deliver radio speeches to his compatriots, condemning the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. Despite facing criticism for some of his post-war views, Mann's literary contributions and his opposition to fascism have left a lasting legacy.</p>

Despite the May rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year.

Knee and ankle issues began in 2017, then two years later she needed treatment for pericarditis - an inflammation of the fluid-filled sac around the heart - which was potentially career-ending. She took time out as she struggled with fatigue in the build-up to Euro 2022, while another knee injury, that required surgery, forced her to miss the 2023 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a game marked by individual redemption stories. Max Muncy atoned for an earlier error with two home runs, including a game-tying blast in the ninth inning, while Tanner Scott pitched a scoreless tenth after a recent slump. Freddie Freeman's walk-off double in the tenth secured the win, keeping the Dodgers in first place in the National League West. The victory showcased resilience from several players and helped to overcome recent frustrations.</p>
