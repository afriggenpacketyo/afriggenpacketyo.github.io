While other data center-linked stocks like Eaton and Vertiv have also rallied, they haven't reached pre-DeepSeek levels like GE Vernova. Analysts suggest GE Vernova's earlier stage in the revenue upcycle and larger backlog contribute to its outperformance. The article also mentions a $14.2 billion gas turbines and energy solutions deal with Saudi Arabia and an executive order supporting the U.S. nuclear power industry as positive factors for GE Vernova.

          <p>The CNBC Make It Book Club has selected "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as its June read. The book addresses whether it's foolish to believe in people's fundamental decency, arguing that optimism is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki's research at the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab indicates that cynics are often sicker, sadder, poorer, and more incorrect. The book suggests that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned by anyone, making it a valuable read for navigating complicated times.</p>
