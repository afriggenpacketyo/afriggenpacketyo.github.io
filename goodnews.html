          <h2>Trump Fails to Sway Republicans on Tax Bill Amid SALT Deduction Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 13:21:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attempt to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a tax bill faltered due to disagreements over state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The "SALT Caucus" opposes the bill, arguing it doesn't adequately increase deductions for their constituents, particularly in states like New York and California. The 2017 tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000, which was seen as a political move against Democratic-leaning states. Trump reportedly told the caucus to "Let it go," but the intra-party conflict threatens the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and Scotland) may be eligible for compensation of up to ¬£70 each following a court ruling that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair. The legal case, initiated by Walter Merricks, argued that shoppers were overcharged due to fees levied on transactions between 1992 and 2008. The European Commission had previously ruled in 2007 that Mastercard's fees infringed competition law. Consumers can register online to claim their payout, with any unclaimed funds going to the company that funded the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced new guidelines for approving future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy individuals. The agency will now demand clinical trials showing safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children, unlike the previous practice of relying on antibody response tests. Immunogenicity data will still be accepted for high-risk individuals, including those over 65 or with underlying conditions. This shift comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has saved thousands of lives. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Medicaid expansion led to a 21% reduction in mortality among low-income adults and saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that loss of Medicaid coverage, particularly the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy, resulted in fewer prescriptions filled and increased mortality rates among dual-eligible individuals. These findings underscore the potential deadly consequences of proposed Medicaid cuts and increased eligibility checks.</p>

          <p>Walmart shifted its tone on tariffs, warning that increased duties on imports would lead to higher prices for shoppers. This contrasted with earlier downplaying of the issue. The company's CFO stated that the increases were beyond any retailer's capacity to absorb. President Trump responded with criticism, telling Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS." This exchange illustrates the challenges businesses face balancing customer interests, shareholder expectations, and the Trump administration's trade policies. Walmart reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining low prices while acknowledging the reality of retail margins.</p>

          <p>The European Union has decided to lift its economic sanctions on Syria following an Islamist rebel group's overthrow of former dictator Bashar Assad. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, announced the decision, stating the goal is to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive, and peaceful Syria. However, some sanctions will remain in place, targeting individuals and organizations linked to the Assad regime and those responsible for human rights violations. Export restrictions on weapons and goods used for domestic repression will also continue.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential monthly payouts from a $25,000 annuity, noting that the amount varies based on factors like age, gender, and the type of annuity. Immediate annuities for a $25,000 investment can generate payouts between $100 and $180 per month, although payouts for women are lower than for men due to longer life expectancy. Other options include deferred, fixed, variable, and indexed annuities, each with varying levels of risk and potential return. The article discusses the pros and cons of investing in a small annuity, emphasizing the importance of considering individual financial goals and risk tolerance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Home Depot announced it will not raise prices broadly due to tariffs, but some product options may be discontinued if import costs make them unprofitable. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's warning about potential price increases due to tariffs. Home Depot executives cited the company's size and high percentage of domestically sourced items as factors enabling them to absorb the costs. The company has also encouraged suppliers to diversify their sourcing to reduce reliance on any single foreign country.</p>
