          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to commence in Egypt, centered on a 20-point peace plan proposed by U.S. President Trump. The plan, which aims to end the two-year war in Gaza, includes the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and transferring Gaza's control to an international body. While Israel has reportedly agreed, Hamas has accepted key points but remains hesitant on others, such as its disarmament. The international community watches with cautious optimism as the talks begin, with President Trump urging a swift resolution to prevent further bloodshed.</p>

The company recently announced a $1.1 billion funding round at an $8.1 billion valuation, which also necessitated a revised filing. Cerebras is repositioning itself to include a cloud business alongside its large-scale chip production, aiming to compete with industry leader Nvidia.</p>

          <p>The 2025 domestic box office is projected to surpass $9 billion, potentially marking its most successful year since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Analysts anticipate a strong fourth quarter driven by a slate of highly anticipated films, including Disney's "Tron: Ares," Universal's "Wicked: For Good," and "Avatar: Fire and Ash." This winter lineup is expected to provide the momentum needed to push the year's total ticket sales past the 2023 high of $9.05 billion. The industry's recovery is also expected to continue into 2026 with a roster of blockbusters based on popular intellectual property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing is preparing to increase its production of the 737 MAX jet, potentially reaching a rate of 42 planes per month soon, with further increases planned for the coming years. The company has informed its suppliers of the potential ramp-up as it works to stabilize operations following a series of quality control issues. Production has been capped at 38 jets per month since a mid-air fuselage blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight prompted intense scrutiny. Any production increase is contingent on approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has maintained close oversight of Boeing's manufacturing processes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023. This persistence is attributed to a form of passive resistance from workers, who are complying with mandates on their own terms through practices like "coffee badging"—showing up just long enough to be seen—and "micro-shifting" their work hours. Experts suggest that middle managers are often reluctant to enforce strict attendance rules, and some companies may be using the mandates as a way to reduce headcount without layoffs. This trend highlights a continuing disconnect between executive mandates and employee desires for flexibility.</p>
