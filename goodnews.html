          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are actually underspending. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and recent strong earnings from Alphabet justify increased capital expenditures in the field. Despite acknowledging current flaws in AI chatbots, Cramer believes these investments are crucial for developing superior technology that could lead to near-monopoly profits, similar to Google's dominance in search.

          <h2>Explainer: Why the Biden Administration Did Not Release the Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the legal and political reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete Jeffrey Epstein investigation files, despite their potential to contain information about Donald Trump. It explains that grand jury testimony is legally protected and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances, which would have been a high bar to clear. Furthermore, releasing raw investigative material outside of a criminal proceeding is highly unusual for the FBI due to privacy concerns and the protection of ongoing investigations. The article suggests that even if the Biden administration had wanted to, it lacked the unilateral authority to release the files.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "absolutely convinced" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, despite historical trends of the president's party losing seats. He based his optimism on the number of Democratic-held seats in districts that President Trump won in 2024 and demographic shifts favoring the GOP. Johnson also defended the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting its tax cuts and other provisions will act as "jet fuel" for the economy and that voters will feel the benefits.

While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, demand for AI expertise is accelerating as more companies integrate the technology into their operations. These roles are not just for advanced AI engineers but also for positions in marketing, finance, and human resources. Notably, jobs requiring AI skills offer an average salary premium of 28% compared to similar roles without that requirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, preserves the ability of individuals and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The court intervened in a case from North Dakota, blocking a lower appellate court ruling that had uniquely stripped private citizens of the right to sue. This action maintains the status quo across most of the country, where such lawsuits are the primary mechanism for challenging discriminatory voting maps and practices. However, the victory may be temporary, as the court is set to rehear a separate, similar case from Louisiana next term.</p>
