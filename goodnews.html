          <p>Friday's newspaper front pages are dominated by the assisted dying bill vote and Donald Trump's decision on potential US involvement in the Middle East conflict. The Daily Express features Sophie Blake's plea for the right to a "good death," while the Daily Telegraph notes Labour MPs' concerns about the bill. The Daily Mail highlights Robert Jenrick's opposition, and the Guardian focuses on Trump's two-week deadline for Iran. The Financial Times reports on the EU's push for a UK-style trade deal with the US, and the i Paper covers compensation for victims of the Post Office Capture computer scandal.

Over 5,500 people applied for the journey, with 750 being allowed to travel. These pilgrimages have historically played a positive role in stabilizing China-India relations during crises.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company known for Labubu dolls, continued to fall after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its China and Hong Kong focus list. Despite year-to-date gains exceeding 160%, the stock experienced its first negative week since early May, declining more than 5%. Morgan Stanley had previously raised its price target on Pop Mart, citing long-term growth potential, but cautioned that the stock's high valuation might limit future outperformance.

          <p>China has maintained its benchmark lending rates, following monetary easing measures from the previous month, as a trade deal with the U.S. alleviates some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade.

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by 20 states challenging the Department of Transportation's imposition of immigration enforcement conditions on grant applications.

While the Kremlin dismisses fears of waning influence, diplomatic observers note that Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's increasing presence.
