        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Whirlpool anticipates that President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will provide them with a competitive edge against foreign competitors like LG and Samsung. The company manufactures 80% of its products in the U.S. and sources 96% of its metal domestically, leading to higher prices for American consumers. The tariffs could level the playing field by increasing costs for foreign competitors, potentially spurring domestic manufacturing and hiring. Research indicates similar tariffs on washing machines during Trump's first term increased prices for consumers by an average of $86 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store rebranding controversy, suggesting the company should revert to its old logo. He believes the company could leverage the free publicity to its advantage by holding a news conference. Trump's comments follow criticism from his son, Donald Trump Jr., and a drop in the company's stock price after the new logo was unveiled. As part of the rebranding, Cracker Barrel removed the image of its "Uncle Herschel" character from the logo.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has questioned whether England possesses the killer instinct needed to win the upcoming Ashes series. Langer highlighted England's recent drawn series against Australia and India, suggesting they lacked the ability to close out crucial matches. He emphasized the importance of aggressive play in Australia, citing the success of players who attacked Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. England has a poor record in Australia since 1987, making Langer's comments a part of the ongoing psychological battle before the series.</p>

          <p>Texas schools, transformed into relief hubs after devastating floods, have reopened their doors to students, providing a sense of normalcy amidst tragedy. Schools like Hunt School offered food, shelter, and support for affected families and volunteers. The transition back to classrooms required significant effort from volunteers, who helped restore the buildings. Educators now face the challenge of addressing the social and emotional needs of students who experienced loss and trauma, emphasizing compassion and flexibility in their approach. It's important to remember that it's okay to not be okay, and to talk to friends, parents, and teachers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Managing credit card debt is a significant concern for many households, with options like balance transfers, personal loans, and HELOCs offering potential solutions. Balance transfers involve moving debt to a new card with a promotional 0% interest rate, while personal loans provide fixed monthly payments over a set period. HELOCs utilize home equity for a low-rate line of credit, but risk foreclosure if payments are not met. The best option depends on individual financial profiles, debt amounts, and repayment timelines, with careful consideration of interest rates, fees, and potential risks (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are weighing in on the mortgage interest rate forecast for fall 2025, with opinions varying on whether rates will rise or drop. The Federal Reserve's September meeting and potential rate cut are key factors influencing the outlook. While a September rate cut may already be factored into the market, further cuts in October and December could lead to lower rates later in the fall. Fannie Mae projects mortgage rates around 6.5% by the end of the year, while others anticipate rates closer to 6%, impacting the homebuying landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Investors with large profits in taxable brokerage accounts may qualify for 0% capital gains taxes, allowing them to take profits without triggering a tax bill. Many investors are unaware of their eligibility for the 0% bracket, which depends on taxable income. President Donald Trump's tax law, while not changing capital gains rates, introduced new deductions that could lower taxable income for 2025. The new tax break for older Americans could further reduce taxable income, presenting a golden opportunity to sell assets at 0% capital gains (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed the Trump administration's lawsuit against Maryland judges over an immigration order, citing a violation of constitutional tradition and the rule of law. The lawsuit challenged a standing order that barred federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants challenging their detentions. Judge Cullen found that the U.S. lacked the legal right to sue and the judges were immune from the suit. He criticized the administration's attacks on the judiciary and suggested appealing the order through established legal channels.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss the Energy Efficiency of Leaving AC On or Off</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:23:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts debate the most energy-efficient way to use air conditioning, with some advocating for turning it off when leaving home and others recommending continuous operation. Setting the thermostat a few degrees higher while away is generally considered the best balance between energy efficiency and comfort. Factors such as climate, home insulation, and AC unit type influence energy savings. Adjusting the thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling, while humidity levels may impact the feasibility of turning off the AC entirely.</p>
