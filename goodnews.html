          <h2>Pennsylvania Governor Calls for Universal Condemnation of Political Violence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing and a separate deadly shootout in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro urged Americans to universally condemn political violence regardless of its source. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and called for healing and unity over division. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including the firebombing of the governor's mansion in April, to emphasize that such acts leave lasting scars on society. Shapiro stressed the legal distinction between protected, though often offensive, political speech and illicit incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's milestone 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto made a unique request to the Los Angeles Angels star. In addition to receiving three signed bats and two signed baseballs, Alberto asked if he and Trout could play catch on the field. The three-time MVP readily agreed, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family who were in attendance. The home run, a 485-foot blast, made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer mark and the 20th to do so with a single franchise.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young prevented a near-certain extra-base hit with a juggling, 'hacky-sack' style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss dropped the Mets into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final playoff spot.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim measure. In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that halting the annual production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons would be a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could be leveraged to resume talks, which broke down in 2019. Lee's pragmatic approach aims to reduce regional tensions and establish a more stable path toward long-term peace.</p>

          <p>Week 3 of the NFL season featured several wild finishes, highlighted by the Philadelphia Eagles' stunning 33-26 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Rams. The Eagles erased a 19-point deficit, with the game ending on a blocked field-goal attempt that was returned for a touchdown by Jordan Davis as time expired. In another dramatic contest, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the New York Jets 29-27 after the Jets had taken a late lead on their own blocked field-goal return. Elsewhere, the Cleveland Browns secured a last-second win over the Green Bay Packers with a 55-yard field goal.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Approves Controversial Second Runway for London's Gatwick Airport</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million. While the government has championed the project as a "no-brainer for growth," it faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions. The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate these impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A security camera at a West Virginia high school captured the moment the school's principal, James Marsh, had a surprise encounter with a black bear. As Marsh went to unlock a large dumpster, the lid was pushed open from the inside by the bear, which had apparently become trapped while foraging for food. The startled principal quickly ran in one direction while the bear climbed out and fled in the other, with no one being harmed in the incident. The video serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife interactions as natural habitats shrink, highlighting the importance of securing trash.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced it will increase its presence around synagogues, schools, and community centers as the Jewish High Holy Days begin. This proactive measure is a response to a rise in antisemitic attacks across the country and aims to deter crime while providing reassurance to the Jewish community. Mayor Karen Bass affirmed that antisemitism is unacceptable in the city and thanked the LAPD for its efforts to protect Jewish Angelenos during this important period of observance. The High Holy Days commence with Rosh Hashana and conclude with Yom Kippur on October 2nd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli secured a 1-1 draw for Arsenal against Manchester City, denying the visitors a crucial victory at Emirates Stadium. City manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, a tactic that nearly succeeded. The result, however, primarily benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League table. City's possession of just 32.8% was the lowest ever recorded by a Guardiola-managed team in a league match, reflecting the pragmatic but ultimately unsuccessful strategy.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend where Piastri uncharacteristically struggled. Piastri crashed in qualifying and again early in the race, failing to score any points. Norris, however, could only manage a seventh-place finish after a difficult qualifying session where he hit a wall, a result he attributed to track conditions and strategic decisions. While Norris viewed it as a missed opportunity, the weekend highlighted the intense pressure of the title fight and allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to close the points gap.</p>

          <p>A section of London's bustling Oxford Street was closed to traffic for one day as part of a trial for a permanent pedestrianization plan. Mayor Sadiq Khan, who visited the event, hailed it as "the day the fight back began to rescue this street," envisioning a future with increased footfall and space for outdoor events. The proposal aims to ban vehicles from the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. However, the plan has faced opposition from some local councillors and residents who are concerned about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>Fighter jets from Germany and Sweden were scrambled on Sunday to intercept a Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea. The Russian plane was reportedly flying without a transponder signal, providing no flight path or radio contact, which prompted the response. The German Eurofighters and Swedish Gripen jets monitored and photographed the aircraft in international airspace before the encounter ended without incident. The interception comes amid heightened alert among NATO and EU nations regarding Russian military and surveillance activities in the region, following recent incursions into Estonian airspace.</p>
