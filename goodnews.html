          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new record high, buoyed by a significant gain in Home Depot shares, even though the retailer's quarterly revenue and earnings slightly missed analyst expectations. Home Depot, however, maintained its full-year outlook, with a notable surge in July comparable-store sales indicating strong momentum for the upcoming quarter. Concurrently, Nvidia is reportedly developing a more advanced AI processor for China, a strategic move to continue its presence in the market despite export restrictions. This new chip, intended for sampling next month, reflects the company's adaptability in a complex geopolitical landscape.

          <p>Anteres Anderson Turner and Louis Turner, a California couple raising twin boys, discovered a unique solution to their family's missing intergenerational connection by finding a 'surrogate grandmother.' They connected with Janet Firestein Daw through Surrogate Grandparents USA, a Facebook group facilitating such relationships. Daw, who desired grandchildren, quickly bonded with the boys and became 'Nana J,' actively participating in family life and trips. This arrangement has brought immense relief and a sense of completion to the Turners, while filling a lifelong void for Daw, even after her own child later had a baby. The story exemplifies how unconventional solutions can foster deep family bonds and community support.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts continue to offer compelling returns for savers, with current rates around 4% providing a secure alternative to volatile stock markets. For a substantial $150,000 deposit, potential interest earnings vary significantly based on the term length; a three-month CD at 4.30% could yield approximately $1,587, while a five-year CD at 4.20% might generate over $34,000. Unlike variable-rate savings accounts, CDs guarantee a fixed rate for the entire term, offering predictability crucial for managing large sums. This article highlights how CDs combine hefty returns with the assurance of principal safety, making them a valuable tool for financial planning in today's economic climate.

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ rating for long-term US sovereign debt, projecting that substantial federal revenue generated from President Trump's extensive tariff policies will largely offset the anticipated revenue reduction from his recent tax-and-spending legislation. Despite this stable outlook, S&P issued a cautionary note, indicating that the rating could face downgrades within the next two to three years if escalating deficits persist due to political challenges in managing spending or the revenue implications of tax code alterations. Furthermore, the agency highlighted that any political developments undermining the integrity of American institutions or the Federal Reserve's autonomy could imperil the dollar's crucial status as the world's leading reserve currency.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly impacting the work of teachers, with advocates highlighting its potential as a helpful tool for both educators and students. Jerome Ong, a 5th-grade teacher, uses AI weekly, teaching students its capabilities and limitations. Major tech companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic have committed $23 million to train hundreds of thousands of teachers through the American Federation of Teachers, aiming to empower educators and streamline lesson planning. While AI can save teachers significant time, critics raise concerns about cheating and potential declines in critical thinking skills if not used responsibly, emphasizing the need for robust support systems for teachers beyond technology.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced he will begin interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair after Labor Day, from a pool of 11 strong contenders. The list includes current and former central bank officials, economists, and Wall Street experts. This expedited process reflects the White House's urgency for interest rate cuts, which Bessent believes would stimulate the struggling US housing market by facilitating home building. While acknowledging a recent rise in producer prices, Bessent attributed it to stock market values, not core inflation. The current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, is expected to give his final keynote address at Jackson Hole soon, potentially signaling future policy directions.</p>

          <p>Air Canada announced the gradual resumption of its flights following a tentative agreement reached with the union representing 10,000 flight attendants, concluding a strike that significantly disrupted summer travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The agreement addresses a key union demand by guaranteeing pay for flight attendants during ground time. While flights are set to begin resuming Tuesday evening, Air Canada cautioned that full service restoration could take seven to ten days due to the logistical complexities of restarting a major airline. This resolution, achieved with mediation, means no further strikes or lockouts can occur during the contract ratification process, aiming to stabilize travel for affected customers.</p>

          <p>The US government is actively pursuing an equity stake in Intel, as confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in return for CHIPS Act funds designated to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Lutnick explained that the Trump administration seeks to convert what were previously grants under the Biden administration into non-voting equity for American taxpayers, arguing for a "piece of the action." This strategic move aims to reduce the US's dependence on foreign chip manufacturers like TSMC. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that this potential stake would not obligate US businesses to purchase Intel chips, emphasizing the core objective is to stabilize and enhance domestic chip production capabilities for national security and economic resilience.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock climbed 4% after the retailer reiterated its full-year sales and comparable sales forecasts, even though its quarterly earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street's projections. While net income saw a minor decrease, the company observed improving sales trends throughout the quarter, culminating in a strong 3.3% comparable sales increase in July. CFO Richard McPhail attributed this to momentum in core categories and growth in both professional and DIY customer segments, despite a "deferral mindset" among homeowners. The company's maintained outlook does not account for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could further stimulate the housing market. Home Depot is strategically expanding its professional customer base through recent acquisitions like SRS Distribution and GMS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has implemented an emergency ban on "designer Xanax," known as bromazolam, by classifying it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, enabling immediate law enforcement action against its sale and possession. This decisive move was initiated following a request from Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is also leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the US Drug Enforcement Administration to enact a federal emergency ban. Bromazolam, an unregulated synthetic drug, has been linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, posing a significant and growing public health threat. This bipartisan effort underscores a critical response to the dangers of illicitly manufactured, highly potent substances.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are cautioning that "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services, popular amidst persistent inflation, carry hidden risks that can derail personal budgets despite appearing as interest-free installment plans. While BNPL offers quick access to financing, it can foster unsustainable spending habits and lead to overextension, especially when multiple services are used without inter-company data sharing. Experts cite cases of clients accumulating significant debt, forcing them to deplete savings or incur penalties. They advise against using BNPL for basic needs, emphasize understanding repayment periods, and warn against repaying BNPL debt with credit cards, recommending instead saving through "sinking funds" and applying a waiting rule for purchases.

          <p>Apple has reportedly ramped up iPhone production in India, including at new plants and facilities belonging to Tata Group and Foxconn Technology, as the country faces increased pressure from the White House over its Russian oil purchases. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused India of "profiteering" from discounted Russian oil, leading President Trump to impose higher tariffs on Indian exports. This move by Apple to expand manufacturing in India is part of its broader strategy to reduce reliance on China amid trade tensions. The increased domestic production and significant investments in US manufacturing aim to mitigate the impact of potential India-related tariffs and align with American economic priorities.</p>
