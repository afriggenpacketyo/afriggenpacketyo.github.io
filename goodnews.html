          <p>Newly released audio from Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about his youthfulness despite memory lapses regarding key events such as his son Beau's death and Donald Trump's election year. Hur's report cited Biden as a 'sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,' leading to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. The report acknowledged Biden willfully obtained classified documents during his time as vice president and as a senator. Biden later dropped out of the presidential race in July and finished his term.</p>

          <p>The Sunday Times rich list highlights the growing disparity between the ultra-wealthy and the average person, with the wealth required to make the list tripling since 1989. The article argues that wealth accumulation, largely through passive returns on existing assets, exacerbates inequality and gives the super-rich undue influence over politics and the environment. To address this, the author proposes establishing an 'extreme wealth line,' similar to the poverty line, to define the point at which wealth accumulation becomes harmful and necessitates policy intervention through taxation or charitable donations. The article advocates for a democratic approach, potentially through a citizens' assembly, to determine this line and curb the excesses of wealth inequality.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks secured their place in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years with a decisive victory over the Boston Celtics. After a season of injuries and roster changes, the Knicks found their identity, blending resilience with explosive offense led by Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson. Team President Leon Rose's strategic trades and signings, such as Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby, have transformed the Knicks from an NBA laughing stock into legitimate title contenders. Now, the Knicks face the Indiana Pacers in what promises to be a challenging series.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, leaving only its feet behind. Police are investigating the theft, but residents suspect it may have been an act of vandalism or a means to melt the statue down for cash. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze after being set on fire in 2020, never gained much affection from locals, who found it unaesthetic. The statue was commissioned by an American artist, Brad Downey, who saw it as an interrogation of President Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. It revealed that these early settlers split into distinct groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, contributing to the diverse genetic makeup of present-day South American communities. The findings also highlight the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of endangered Indigenous groups, such as the Kawesqar people of Patagonia.</p>
