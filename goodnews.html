          <p>New York City has experienced the fewest shootings and murders in recorded history during the first five months of the year, according to city officials. From January through May, there were 264 recorded shootings and 112 recorded homicides, marking new lows. Mayor Eric Adams attributed these achievements to the administration's commitment to precision policing, strategic resource deployment, and investments in young New Yorkers. The police have also removed roughly 22,000 illegal guns from the city's streets. The NYPD reported an overall crime index dip of nearly 3% last year, with sizable reductions in cases of murder, robbery, burglary, grand larceny, and motor vehicle theft.</p>

          <p>The Senate is debating President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package, which could include changes to the child tax credit. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed via Trump's 2017 tax cuts, and the highest credit would rise to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. Policy experts anticipate interesting negotiations, as the Senate may have different plans.

          <p>California native plant landscapes can sometimes appear drab, especially in the summer when many plants go dormant. However, with careful planning, native plants can bring vibrant color to a garden while supporting local birds and pollinators.

For reds and oranges, consider Hollywood Flame Hummingbird Fuchsia and desert globemallow, and for purples and blues, woolly bluecurls and celestial blue sage are excellent choices.

          <p>California legislators are considering significant changes to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark state environmental law. Two proposals aim to streamline the law for urban housing developments and weaken rules for other projects. Governor Newsom supports these changes, aiming to expedite approval as part of the state budget. CEQA requires proponents to disclose and lessen environmental effects, but it has also been criticized for delaying housing and infrastructure projects. These changes could restrict community groups' ability to shape development and reduce transparency in environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>California is considering a bill that would mandate phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a shift from the long-standing "whole language" approach. The bill aims to improve reading scores, which have been below the national average, by requiring districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading." This approach emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The bill has gained support from teachers unions and advocacy groups, with compromises to allow districts flexibility in selecting materials and teacher training. Early results from districts that have adopted structured phonics learning show significant gains in reading test scores.</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant is grappling with the ethics of enforcing rules against AI-generated writing, as students increasingly view it as acceptable. The article posits that the true value of a humanities education lies in cultivating character and practical wisdom, rather than simply producing scholarly outputs. Generative AI challenges this by removing the cognitive friction necessary for developing critical thinking skills. The author proposes a solution: allow AI use but require students to reflect on its impact, fostering a deeper understanding of their learning process. It advocates for educators to focus on cultivating students' judgment and ethical decision-making in the age of AI.</p>
