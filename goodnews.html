          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs) are crucial for various technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems, and this article explains their importance. China dominates the mining and processing of REEs, raising concerns in Western nations about supply chain security. The EU and the US are taking steps to develop internal supplies, with the EU enacting the Critical Raw Materials Act and the US investing in domestic companies. Untapped sources in Ukraine and Greenland are of interest, but access remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Canada for the G7 summit presents an opportunity to improve strained relations between the two countries. Tensions arose after Canada accused India of involvement in the assassination of a Sikh activist, allegations India denies. Despite unresolved issues and criticism from some Canadian Sikh groups, both countries have mutual interests in trade and people-to-people ties. Analysts suggest the visit could stabilize the partnership and focus on economic and geopolitical cooperation.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament on Friday enacted a pension reform law that will scrap a 1.06 million yen ($7,400) annual income threshold blamed for prompting part-timers to limit their work hours, while opening the way for a future boost to basic pension benefits. The enactment came as a result of a last-minute compromise by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who heads a minority government, as the ruling coalition decided to accept a demand by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, a major opposition force, to include a pledge to consider boosting the basic pension benefits in the future.

          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is modifying planned disability benefit cuts worth ¬£5bn a year by 2030 to gain support from Labour MPs. The changes aim to soften the impact of the cuts, which include making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). Protections include a 13-week transitional Pip payment, continued carer's allowance, and extra income support for those with severe health conditions. A scheme allowing disabled people to try employment without losing benefits will also be introduced.</p>
