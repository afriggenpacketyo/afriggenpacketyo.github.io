        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following President Trump's indication of progress towards a nuclear deal with Iran, raising expectations of increased oil exports from the country. The anticipation of Iran resuming weapon-grade uranium enrichment, coupled with the potential lifting of economic sanctions, could introduce up to 1 million barrels per day into the global market. However, analysts suggest that OPEC+ might adjust their plans to mitigate the impact of increased Iranian exports. The original Iran nuclear deal, brokered in 2015, aimed to curb Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, but faced challenges after the U.S. withdrew in 2018.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times article analyzes winning Eurovision songs since 2000 to identify key elements for success, noting that songs about personal liberation, self-belief, and defying societal norms tend to do well. Singing in English is also favored, with many winners blending English verses with their native language for broader appeal. Incorporating folk music elements and traditional instruments adds a unique flavor, but the article cautions against sending a purely folk song, as Eurovision remains a pop contest. Staging and visual elements are also critical, with memorable performances and striking outfits often capturing viewers' attention, though gimmicks should not overshadow the song itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his disapproval to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India, advocating instead for domestic manufacturing in the United States. Trump referenced Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and urged Cook to prioritize building plants within the country. Apple has been shifting production to India to reduce its reliance on China, where the majority of its iPhones are currently assembled. Trump emphasized that the U.S. had accommodated Apple's manufacturing in China for years and now expects the company to invest in American production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy has shown signs of recovery, with a growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, exceeding analysts' forecasts, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, though it precedes the implementation of US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes in April. While Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis, she highlighted the UK's potential to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the first three months of the year. However, some economists remain skeptical, suggesting that this growth may be unsustainable due to the impact of tariffs and tax increases.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article discusses the challenges faced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in keeping politics out of the Eurovision Song Contest. The EBU, an organization based in Geneva, enforces a strict "no politics" rule, scrutinizing lyrics, outfits, and stage props to maintain neutrality. Despite these efforts, the article highlights the inherent difficulty in separating politics from the competition, especially amid global conflicts like the war in Gaza and the exclusion of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. The EBU's attempts to strike a balance between artistic expression and political neutrality are continuously tested, raising questions about consistency and fairness.</p>

While some NATO members consider the 5% target unrealistic, discussions are underway to find a compromise, potentially involving investments in defense-related infrastructure.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling its release of stockpiled rice to roughly 600,000 tons to address soaring rice prices amid a supply shortfall. This measure follows previous auctions and aims to stabilize prices, which have recently fallen after reaching record highs. However, reducing the stockpile raises concerns about the government's ability to respond to future harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing requirements for rice distributors to buy back the same amount of rice within a year, hoping to encourage more participation in auctions.</p>
