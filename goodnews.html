          <p>Hims & Hers Health reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but its shares fell in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected outlook. The telehealth company's revenue increased by 111% compared to the same period last year, with a net income of $49.5 million. However, the company's revenue forecast for the second quarter fell short of analysts' estimates. Despite the disappointing guidance, Hims & Hers indicated that more collaborations are on the horizon, after Novo Nordisk announced it would offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through telehealth providers like Hims & Hers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Army has temporarily suspended helicopter training flights around the Pentagon after two commercial flights were disrupted last week. The decision was prompted by an incident where an Army helicopter on a training mission was instructed to circle the Pentagon again before landing, leading to 'go-arounds' for two commercial flights at Reagan National Airport. The FAA stated the Black Hawk was a priority air transport helicopter, while Army officials disputed claims the helicopter took a 'scenic route.' This pause comes shortly after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for the DCA air traffic control team and restricted nonessential helicopter operations around the airport.</p>
