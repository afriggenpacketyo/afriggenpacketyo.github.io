          <h2>Financial Strategies for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about the solvency of Social Security, seniors are exploring ways to supplement their retirement income. The article outlines several options for homeowners and those with savings to generate additional funds. These strategies include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to access their home equity as monthly payments. Another option is purchasing annuities, which provide guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment. While personal loans are also a possibility, they come with higher interest rates and add to personal debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Treasury Reports Unexpected June Surplus Driven by Increased Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:19:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence attributed to a significant surge in customs duties and a 13% rise in overall receipts. This surplus has slightly reduced the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion. The increase in tariff collections, which are up 301% compared to the previous year, follows the implementation of broad 10% tariffs on imports by the Trump administration. Despite the monthly surplus, the government continues to face high interest costs on the national debt, a persistent challenge for federal finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle cast into the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland, Canada, in 2012 has been discovered on a beach in Ireland, 13 years later. The note was written by Brad and Anita Squires, who were on a day trip and tossed the bottle from a cliff, assuming it would break. It was found by Kate and Jon Gay, who shared the discovery online, quickly leading them to connect with the Squires, now a married couple with three children. The story has been celebrated as a symbol of connection and resilience, bringing joy to both the finders and the senders.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors allege Guzman Lopez and his brother led a violent faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as "Los Chapitos," responsible for a massive fentanyl trafficking operation. As part of his plea agreement, he must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. This marks a significant development in U.S. efforts to dismantle the cartel's leadership.</p>

          <p>The highly-watched seventh season of "Love Island USA" has been noted for a distinct lack of deep romantic connections, with viewers dubbing it "Situationship Island." This article suggests the show serves as a portrait of Gen Z dating culture, characterized by emotional guardedness and anxiety about vulnerability. Many of the young contestants, who came of age during the pandemic, seem to struggle with forming genuine bonds, often appearing suspicious of affection and slow to commit. Despite this, the show's popularity remains high, possibly because viewers relate to the contestants' emotional hesitancy and are drawn to those who dare to be openly enthusiastic.</p>

          <p>Fast bowler Jofra Archer made an electrifying comeback to Test cricket, taking a key wicket with his third ball on a dramatic second day of the match between England and India at Lord's. After a four-year absence due to injury, Archer's emotional return helped England gain crucial breakthroughs against a resilient Indian side. The day also saw England's Joe Root set a new record for the most catches by an outfielder in Test history. With India closing at 145-3 in response to England's 387, the match remains tightly contested and beautifully poised.</p>

          <p>The widely accepted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day for good health originated not from scientific research, but as a 1960s marketing campaign for a Japanese pedometer. While the number is somewhat arbitrary, modern studies show it's not far off from a meaningful health benchmark. Research indicates that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, begin at lower counts like 2,500 steps, with significant gains seen around 7,500 steps. Experts agree that while 10,000 steps is a practical and motivating target, the key is consistency and moving more than you currently do, with a brisker pace offering greater benefits.</p>

          <p>A recent article from The Atlantic reflects on the concept of American exceptionalism, challenging the belief that the U.S. is immune to the political and social issues seen in other nations. Drawing on two new books, the essay explores how historical events in other countries, such as Argentina's "Dirty War," offer cautionary tales about unchecked state power that are relevant to the U.S. today. Conversely, it also highlights how democratic principles like birthright citizenship were pioneered in Latin America, suggesting the U.S. has as much to learn from its neighbors as it has to teach.</p>

          <p>GP surgeries in 15 regions across England are launching a pilot project aimed at reducing long-term sickness absence by helping patients return to work more quickly. The £1.5 million initiative will fund career coaches and occupational therapists who can offer support like exercise classes or CV advice to patients on fit notes. The government states this is a shift from simply signing people off to actively helping them overcome barriers to employment. This comes as officials seek to address the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions, though GP representatives caution against the measures becoming punitive.</p>

A complaint alleged he had failed to properly register funds raised via a crowdfunder. However, the commissioner concluded that no rules were broken, as Lowe provided evidence that the 28-day window for registering the donations had not yet passed. Lowe described the complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his inquiry and stated that all financial declarations were being handled correctly and within the required timeframe.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to a new record high on Friday, surpassing $118,000 for the first time. The surge was fueled by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion, indicating strong institutional interest. Analysts suggest the rally is also supported by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and potential fiscal expansion, which can be positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum as traders were forced to buy back their positions. (not investment advice)</p>
