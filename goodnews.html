          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicated that Americans' inflation fears decreased in May following President Trump's partial reversal of tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 3.2%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease from April, while the three-year outlook fell to 3%. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that inflation is down by more than it has been in four years, despite rising tariff revenue.
