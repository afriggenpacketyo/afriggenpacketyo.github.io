          <h2>U.S. Weighs Strategic Interests Amidst Greenland's Geopolitical Significance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses America's renewed interest in Greenland, driven by its strategic location and the Arctic's changing geo-economics. With the Arctic warming rapidly and Russia expanding its presence, Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. East Coast makes it a critical territory. The author suggests the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland could adopt a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements in the Pacific, to balance U.S. interests with international concerns, fostering stability and avoiding sovereignty conflicts among NATO allies. The article also notes the potential for intensified tensions within NATO if U.S.-Russian cooperation in the Arctic increases following a Ukraine deal.</p>

          <p>This BBC article summarizes newspaper headlines, focusing on a new US-UK trade deal and the selection of a new Pope. The trade deal, hailed as "historic" by both sides, aims to reduce tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, particularly on the car industry. However, some papers note the deal's limited scope and that Britain is still in a worse position than before. The article also mentions the selection of Leo XIV as the new Pope and his message of building bridges, as well as commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain, which aims to reduce the impact of tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products to the U.K. market, while Britain will have a quota of 100,000 vehicles subject to a 10% tariff. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expects the deal to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The U.K. aims to reduce or eliminate U.S. import taxes on cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agriculture.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying expectations of a slowdown despite increased tariffs from the U.S. Economists suggest this resilience may be due to transshipment through other countries and pre-tariff trade contracts. However, trade data is expected to weaken in the coming months, pending trade negotiations between China and the U.S. President Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting China to retaliate with duties of up to 125% on American goods.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, industries in developed nations are seeking to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on the metal. China, which accounts for over 80% of global tungsten ore production, added tungsten to its export restriction list in February. US defense contractors face a deadline to stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027. Tungsten is crucial for various applications, including cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies.</p>

The agreement leaves in place a 10% baseline tariff imposed in April.
