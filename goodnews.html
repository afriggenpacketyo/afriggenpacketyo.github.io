          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 09:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average monthly benefit by approximately $56. This adjustment, based on the Consumer Price Index, aims to help the program's 71 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation. However, some advocates argue that the metric used doesn't accurately reflect the higher healthcare and housing costs faced by seniors. The increase comes as many older Americans report that their benefits are not sufficient to cover their daily expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 09:08:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index revealed a 3.0% annual inflation rate for September, a figure lower than what most economists had forecast. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, primarily driven by a significant jump in gasoline prices. The report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, is a critical data point for the Federal Reserve. Its findings have reinforced market expectations that the central bank will proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support a softening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. annual inflation rate hit 3% in September, the highest level recorded since January, though this figure was slightly below what economists had anticipated. A significant driver of this increase was a nearly 15% year-over-year surge in the price of beef, creating pressure on consumer grocery budgets. In contrast, egg prices, a previous symbol of inflation, have begun to decline. This mixed economic data presents a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve as it weighs the competing pressures of rising inflation and a slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a stunning political upset, the Labour Party has lost its parliamentary seat in Caerphilly for the first time in over a century, with Plaid Cymru claiming a decisive victory in the Welsh Senedd by-election. Plaid Cymru's candidate, Lindsay Whittle, won with a remarkable 27% swing in the vote, a result that deals a significant blow to Labour's standing in what was considered a stronghold. The outcome is being widely interpreted as a signal of shifting political allegiances in Wales and could have major implications for the next national Senedd election.</p>

          <p>New research analyzing fossils from New Mexico indicates that diverse dinosaur populations were flourishing in North America immediately before the cataclysmic asteroid strike 66 million years ago. By precisely dating the rock formations, scientists have challenged the long-held theory that dinosaurs were already in a state of decline. The findings, which include the massive plant-eater Alamosaurus, one of the largest land animals ever, offer a vivid snapshot of a vibrant ecosystem that was abruptly and violently extinguished, reshaping our understanding of this pivotal moment in Earth's history.</p>

          <p>England's first-choice goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, will be unavailable for the upcoming friendly match against Brazil due to an elbow injury sustained in training. Her absence creates an opportunity for one of the squad's backup keepers, Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse, to make their international debut. Manager Sarina Wiegman confirmed the injury is not considered major and views the situation as a chance to test the depth of her squad as the team begins preparations for the 2027 Women's World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>This article examines the cultural evolution of the "alien" in popular narratives, tracing its transformation from the simplistic little green men of the 1950s to more complex modern interpretations. It posits that these extraterrestrial figures often serve as powerful metaphors for contemporary societal fears, whether it be Cold War paranoia, corporate exploitation, or xenophobia. The analysis further extends this concept to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, suggesting that our collective unease with non-human intelligence stems from a similar, deep-seated fear of the unknown.</p>
