          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing 'Devin,' an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant advancement in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its 12,000-person development team to handle tasks like code updates, aiming to augment its human workforce and potentially boost productivity threefold or more. This move signals a shift toward 'agentic AI,' where programs execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision. While the initiative promises major efficiency gains, it also raises concerns about the future of tech jobs and the potential for significant workforce reductions as AI capabilities expand.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, preventing President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship from being implemented. The order, which sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, faced immediate legal challenges upon its announcement. This ruling effectively halts the administration's policy across the entire country, marking a significant legal setback for one of the president's key immigration initiatives. The decision upholds the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 05:01:03 EDT</div>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar visitor, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever detected, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. Discovered by a telescope in Chile, this is only the third object from beyond our solar system to be observed. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated in the Milky Way's 'thick disk,' a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of significant water ice. As it approaches the Sun later this year, it is expected to develop a glowing tail, potentially making it visible from Earth with amateur telescopes and offering a rare glimpse into a previously unseen part of our galaxy.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. men's national team prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup, parallels are being drawn to South Korea's journey as a host nation in 2002 under coach Guus Hiddink. A year before the 2002 tournament, Hiddink's team suffered heavy defeats, but through intensive preparation and fostering a strong team ethos, they went on to a historic semi-final run. The article suggests U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino could learn from Hiddink's methods, which prioritized fitness and cohesion, effectively turning the national squad into a club-like unit. While Pochettino faces challenges with a roster spread across Europe, Hiddink's success demonstrates how a well-prepared host can defy expectations.</p>

          <p>Amid fears that billions of dollars from opioid settlements could be misused, two advocacy groups have launched a crowdsourced database for the public to report alleged misspending. Families and advocates are concerned that states may use the "blood money" to fill budget gaps rather than fund addiction and recovery services as intended. The new website, created by the Opioid Policy Institute and Popular Democracy, allows users to submit and view cases of potential fund mismanagement, such as a Missouri county using funds for its road department. The initiative aims to pressure state attorneys general to increase oversight and ensure the money addresses the harm caused by the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is intensifying efforts to decrease its reliance on China for rare earth minerals, highlighted by a $400 million Pentagon investment in American miner MP Materials. This move aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for these critical materials, which are essential for defense and technology sectors. However, an industry executive warns that the U.S. faces significant hurdles, including acquiring advanced processing technology and navigating the environmental regulations associated with the highly pollutive mining process. A successful strategy could potentially fulfill up to 50% of U.S. strategic needs by 2028, a crucial goal as Beijing continues to control the global supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Congressman Robert Garcia, a 47-year-old sophomore representative, has been chosen by House Democrats to be the new ranking member on the influential House Oversight Committee. Known for his aggressive political style, Garcia aims to directly confront President Trump and congressional Republicans, stating that voters "want to see a good fight." As the first openly gay immigrant in Congress and the youngest ranking member, he brings a new perspective to Democratic leadership. While he lacks the power to set the committee's agenda or issue subpoenas from the minority, Garcia plans to use his position as a "bully pulpit" to counter Republican narratives and investigate figures like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk if Democrats regain the majority.</p>

          <p>The UK government has paused plans to potentially reduce the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer groups. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering the change to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, the backlash from those who warned it would disincentivize saving altogether has led the Treasury to put the move on hold. While future reforms have not been ruled out, the government's immediate focus will shift to other methods of promoting investment, such as education programs and loosening rules on financial advice.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, standing in stark contrast to a sales slump across much of Europe. The surge is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space, all-wheel drive, and value. This success persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk for his political rhetoric, with a recent survey finding 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons. Norway's strong pro-EV policies, including tax incentives and robust charging infrastructure, continue to make it a uniquely favorable market for the company.</p>
