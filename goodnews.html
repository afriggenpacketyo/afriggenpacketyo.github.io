          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing after recent devastating floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that most of the unaccounted-for individuals were safe. The floods, which occurred around July 4, resulted in 134 deaths across Texas, with 107 of those fatalities in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery from the widespread natural disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Wisconsin was a complex case where technology played a pivotal role in both exonerating a suspect and convicting the killer. Initially, Vander Heyden's boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit corroborated his alibi that he was home during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Location data from Burch's Google Dashboard ultimately tracked his movements from a bar to the crime scene and where the body was dumped, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after six months of service. Fulcher stated the departure was his own decision and amicable, having planned to serve for that duration. During his tenure, he advised on personnel and policy, contributed to reviews of acquisition programs, and supported efforts to streamline IT procurement. His departure is part of a broader series of personnel changes in the Defense Secretary's office since Hegseth took charge in President Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the US Eagles in a decisive match in Washington D.C., marked by high humidity and two lengthy delays due to lightning.

The young English players generally demonstrated superior precision against their American opponents. The event, part of a doubleheader, also highlighted World Rugby's long-term investment in growing the sport in the United States ahead of future World Cups to be hosted on US soil.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, two individuals have been charged with his murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that Muhammad Abdul-Malik, the alleged shooter, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, the accused getaway driver, face murder charges. Moreno was playing video games in his bedroom when he was struck by a bullet not intended for him. A recent breakthrough in the case came from enhanced surveillance video and police sketches, leading to the suspects' arrests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass killings, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. The proposed law aims to close a gap that currently makes it difficult to prosecute individuals who plot violent attacks without a clear political or religious motive, unlike terror suspects. This initiative follows the Southport attack, where the perpetrator could not have been charged with a serious preparatory offense despite potential research into his target. The new power would allow police to intervene and apprehend such individuals much earlier in their planning stages.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred mid-song while she was suspended over the audience, startling the singer but not preventing her from quickly recovering and continuing her performance. After the song concluded, Perry addressed the malfunction with the comment, "Not today, Satan." The event highlights the risks associated with complex aerial stunts that have become common in large-scale concert productions.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Pros and Cons of Shorter School Summer Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and holiday costs for parents, and help with issues like "holiday hunger." However, teachers' unions are largely opposed, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan, while some fear a shorter summer would just concentrate holiday demand and drive up prices further. The discussion reflects differing views on how the school calendar can best serve students, families, and educators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards by being overly cautious and is encouraging a shift from cash savings to stocks and shares investments. The government plans to send details of investment opportunities to people with money in low-interest accounts and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the change. This has sparked a debate, with experts noting that women invest less than men and warning that a forced approach could backfire. The policy aims to make the UK a "nation of investors" to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, private members-only clubs, like Soho House, is gaining popularity in India, catering to the country's growing class of "nouveau riche" entrepreneurs and creators. These contemporary clubs offer a more relaxed and inclusive alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which have long waiting lists and are often inaccessible to those without legacy connections. While still exclusive and expensive, the new clubs prioritize personal accomplishment and creative merit over inherited status. This trend reflects the significant economic and demographic shifts occurring in India's rapidly expanding economy.</p>

          <p>A viral image claiming to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a young girl is not authentic and has been identified as an AI-generated fake. The image, which has circulated on various social media platforms, contains several tell-tale signs of artificial intelligence creation, including deformed hands, distorted background figures, and unnatural features on the subjects. While some genuine photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from past events, this particular image has been debunked. The resurfacing of such fakes highlights the ongoing challenge of misinformation related to high-profile figures.</p>
