          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the dismissal of federal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon who was on trial for allegedly providing fake COVID-19 vaccine cards. Moore and his co-defendants were accused of destroying government-provided vaccines and distributing fraudulent cards in exchange for payments. In her announcement, Bondi stated that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so" and did not deserve to face prison time.</p>
