          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen defended the controversial 'tush push' play, despite his team voting to ban it in the NFL.  The play, which involves an offensive lineman pushing a teammate, failed to garner enough votes for a league-wide ban.  Allen believes the play should remain legal, suggesting teams should focus on stopping it rather than banning it.  The Eagles owner reportedly brought in Jason Kelce to explain why the tush push should be kept in the game.</p>
