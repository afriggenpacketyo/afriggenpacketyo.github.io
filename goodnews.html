          <p>Roki Sasaki, the highly anticipated Los Angeles Dodgers rookie, achieved his first Major League Baseball win, allowing three runs over five innings in a 10-3 victory against the Atlanta Braves. Sasaki (1-1) had a rocky start to his MLB career, taking seven starts to secure his first win. His Japanese teammate, Shohei Ohtani, contributed to the win by hitting a solo home run in the third inning, his eighth of the season, and going 3-for-4 with an RBI. The game's start was delayed by approximately three hours due to rain.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is gaining traction following Reform UK's recent electoral successes, according to Laura Kuenssberg of the BBC. The article suggests that Farage's party is posing a significant challenge to both the Labour and Conservative parties, potentially reshaping British politics. While Labour focuses on demonstrating the positive impact of governance, the Conservatives are striving to present themselves as a credible alternative, and Reform aims to prove its ability to govern effectively beyond campaigning. The Liberal Democrats and Greens also experienced gains, further complicating the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, marking a significant victory for school choice advocates. Supporters argue it will empower parents to choose the best educational options for their children, while critics contend it will divert resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. Starting next school year, families can receive $10,000 per year, with children with disabilities eligible for up to $30,000.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of granting citizenship based on investments, effectively banning "golden passport" programs within the EU. The court found that such schemes undermine the integrity of EU citizenship by making nationality a mere commercial transaction. While purchased passports are now prohibited, "golden visas" offering residency permits for real estate investments remain an option. Anti-corruption advocates hope this ruling will lead to increased scrutiny of golden visa programs and stricter enforcement of due diligence.</p>
