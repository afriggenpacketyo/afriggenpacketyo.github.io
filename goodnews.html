          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE custody, has spoken out against his detention, asserting his commitment to fighting for Palestinian rights. Khalil, detained for over three months, refuted the Trump administration's claims that he poses a threat to U.S. national security, describing his detention as a "kidnapping" where his rights were disregarded. Despite being denied the opportunity to be present for his son's birth, Khalil remains steadfast in his advocacy, asserting that no threat will deter him from speaking out against injustice. He emphasized that there is no place for antisemitism or racism within the Palestinian movement and welcomes Jewish students as integral members.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a U.S. analyst, China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it amid rising Middle East tensions. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests, rather than direct military intervention. This is exemplified by China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels from attacks. China's focus remains on protecting its economic interests, even though a significant portion of its seaborne crude oil comes from Iran.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to allocating 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security, such as border control and protection against cyber attacks. The aim is to accommodate US President Trump's call for increased NATO spending while offering EU countries flexibility. The government expects to reach 4.1% by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then, but has not specified how the 3.5% target will be funded. The National Security Strategy emphasizes competitiveness in science, education, and technology and highlights the job creation benefits of defense investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with a missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, but the limited damage and lack of casualties suggest a potential de-escalation. President Trump stated that Iran had gotten it out of their "system" and expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. If Iran refrains from further attacks, Trump may hold his fire and pursue negotiations. This scenario mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where limited Iranian retaliation led to de-escalation, suggesting Trump's high-risk strategy could yield positive results.</p>

          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save ¬£5bn a year by 2030. The amendment notes "the need for the reform of the social security system" before outlining reasons why the bill should be rejected. The reasons it lists for thwarting the bill include the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health.</p>
