        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts. However, Musk reversed his decision hours later after receiving advice on X to "cool off and take a step back." The Dragon spacecraft is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station. This incident occurred amidst an escalating exchange of words between Musk and Trump, triggered by Musk's criticism of the Republican tax bill. The tone reflects the erratic nature of social media exchanges between powerful figures. The optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's proclamation that sought to bar Harvard University's international students from entering the country. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard had refiled a lawsuit, arguing the proclamation violates the First Amendment and misuses federal law. The judge previously blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The proclamation claimed Harvard has refused to provide information about international students and has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries." The author's tone is cautiously optimistic, reflecting the temporary nature of the legal victory. The optimism score is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trend of food retailers offering products with fewer ingredients is growing, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Consumers are seeking simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists, leading brands to launch less-processed options. However, nutritionists caution that focusing solely on ingredient count can overlook the importance of fortified nutrients. The article explores the debate over whether all ultra-processed food is inherently bad and whether unprocessed food is automatically healthy. The optimism score is 60.</p>
