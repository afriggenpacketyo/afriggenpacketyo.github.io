          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed near the Cabo Verde islands, is on a path to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by this weekend. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict it will intensify into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 3 strength with winds over 111 mph. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, its projected path shows it nearing the Caribbean's Leeward Islands over the weekend, where tropical storm watches have been issued. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, highlighting its potential danger as it moves westward across the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The UK division of online fashion retailer Shein reported a significant 32.3% increase in sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion. The company's pre-tax profit also rose to £38.25 million, reflecting strong growth despite potential economic headwinds like inflation and weaker consumer confidence. This financial success comes as the Singapore-headquartered company pursues an initial public offering in Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles with its previous plans to list in London. The filing highlights both the company's expansion in the UK market and the various risks it faces, including supply chain issues and regulatory changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy expanded by an annualized rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing forecasts and demonstrating resilience in the face of trade headwinds from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by strong exports, which rebounded despite the imposition of a 15% blanket tariff on all U.S.-bound goods, including automobiles. While the performance exceeded expectations, economists remain cautious about the future, warning of a potential slowdown as investment spending softens and the full impact of tariffs affects corporate profits and wages. Personal consumption is expected to rise but could be short-lived if trade pressures persist. (not investment advice)</p>

The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly to a report of the substance found in five separate letters within the building's mailroom. At least two people were exposed to the powder, but officials reported no immediate threat to the public and stated the event was brought under control swiftly. The letters and the substance are being sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico for further testing as the investigation continues into the source and nature of the material.</p>

The Tulare County Sheriff’s Office located him using aircraft with infrared technology and a drone. A deputy was lowered from a California Highway Patrol helicopter to hoist him to safety, and he was treated for only minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' concludes the story of its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, by leaving her single once again, an outcome the article argues is more authentic to her character. After the original 'Sex and the City' ended with traditional romantic pairings for all its heroines, the sequel series explored widowhood and new relationships for Carrie. The finale sees her embracing a future that may not include a man, a resolution that honors the original show's central theme: that female friendships can be the most powerful and enduring soulmate connections, a message the original series finale arguably betrayed.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group's shares surged dramatically in their Hong Kong trading debut, opening at nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful launch reflects strong investor demand for China's pharmaceutical sector, which has seen rising valuations and a rally in biotech stocks this year. Innogen, which develops metabolic drugs, capitalized on this positive market sentiment, with its founder highlighting the significant commercial opportunities available due to unmet clinical demand. The sector's price-to-sales ratio has more than doubled since the end of 2024, indicating robust investor confidence in the industry's growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old man in a quiet Van Nuys neighborhood has been arrested after repeatedly blasting a large train horn he had attached to a palm tree in his yard. For two months, Gary Boyadzhyan set off the deafening horn at irregular times, prompting numerous complaints to the police. He was arrested on Wednesday for interfering with a peace officer and disturbing the peace after sounding the horn just hours after promising officers he would stop. In an interview before his arrest, Boyadzhyan described the disruptive behavior as a "cry for help," alluding to personal and legal troubles that had cost him his job.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic revival. Entrepreneurs are transforming abandoned factories and buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market, bringing new life to the city's historic industrial core. Although the city's population has stabilized at a lower level, the unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average, and the number of working residents has returned to pre-pandemic levels. This slow but steady comeback is being driven by local business owners determined to forge a new identity for Youngstown beyond its steel-producing past.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical content creators on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic procedures. This campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper treatments like dental work and hair implants overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries and create costs for the NHS to fix. Influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and tighten regulations for cosmetic practitioners within England.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously transitioning to a fully plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan shift as an ethical and creative imperative, announced the change was due to business pressures and a desire to be more inclusive. The restaurant experienced a decline in private event bookings and wine sales, as corporate clients and diners were less interested in a high-end, plant-based experience. The reversal highlights the significant challenges even top-tier establishments face in promoting sustainable dining when consumer preference for luxury meat dishes remains strong.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history at the upcoming U.S. Open as the oldest competitor in the singles tournament since 1981. At 45 years old, Williams received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Despite a current world ranking of 654th following a series of injuries, the seven-time Grand Slam champion continues to demonstrate remarkable longevity in the sport. Her participation highlights a unique aspect of professional tennis, where many athletes have historically achieved significant success well into their 30s and 40s, defying typical athletic retirement ages.</p>
