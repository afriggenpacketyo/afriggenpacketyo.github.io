          <p>A new international study published in The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that consuming more potassium-rich foods could significantly reduce the risk of serious heart problems. The research followed 1,200 high-risk patients and found that those who intentionally increased their potassium levels were less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure or arrhythmias. Researchers concluded that raising plasma potassium to high-normal levels could be an inexpensive and widely available preventative strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, this article outlines three expert-recommended strategies for homeowners to reduce their monthly payments. The options include refinancing to a lower interest rate, which is ideal for those with rates above 7%, and mortgage recasting, which involves making a lump-sum payment to recalculate payments. For those facing financial hardship, a loan modification can adjust the original loan terms to make payments more manageable, though it may impact credit. (not investment advice)</p>
