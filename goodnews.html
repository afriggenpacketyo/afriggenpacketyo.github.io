          <p>Ketamine therapy is gaining attention as an alternative treatment for treatment-resistant depression, with some reality stars touting its benefits. While the FDA has approved a ketamine derivative nasal spray for TRD and suicidal ideation, the drug carries risks, including addiction and adverse health issues. Some practices administer ketamine via IV injection alongside psychotherapy, claiming transformative results for clients. Experts caution that ketamine carries a risk of addiction or dependency, and the treatment should be monitored by medical professionals. While ketamine IV therapy could be an alternative option if other treatments haven‚Äôt been effective for mental health conditions, experts urge caution.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emotionally safe parenting is presented as a new approach that prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing in parents. This style involves accepting children's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their full selves. The framework emphasizes doing the inner work to understand one's own emotional triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after dealing with a recent issue involving his truck being repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgot to update his automatic payments, resulting in the repossession of his Ford F-150. He discovered the truck was gone when his trainer asked him to check security footage for packages, revealing the repossession process. He was able to regain possession of the truck after resolving the payment issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer and his team address the question of whether U.S. stocks are still good investments given the recent outperformance of European markets. Despite challenges like tariff announcements and a Moody's downgrade, U.S. stocks are not inherently bad, but selectivity is key, according to Cramer. While Germany's Dax index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, historical data shows the S&P 500 has delivered stronger long-term returns. KKR also emphasizes the unique merits of the U.S. stock market, including its size and the solid earnings growth of many U.S. companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change the military's casualty notification protocol after experiencing the anxiety of waiting for news about her husband during the Vietnam War. She made a deal with the local Western Union office to be notified of telegrams, enabling her to comfort widows in person. Her actions led to a fundamental change in the Army, which now requires service members to notify families in person and offer support. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor her and her husband, marking the first time a military base was named for a civilian.</p>
