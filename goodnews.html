        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. Judge Illston ruled that agencies cannot undertake large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force that disregard congressional mandates, and the President must partner with Congress for such actions. The order effectively pauses any further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit, ensuring that agencies continue to fulfill their statutory duties as defined by Congress. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the administration's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three independent analyses have cast doubt on previous claims of potential signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years from Earth. The initial study suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a gas exclusively produced by life on Earth, in K2-18b's atmosphere. However, the new analyses found no compelling evidence of this gas, with one study suggesting the signal could be attributed to propyne, a gas used in welding. The debate highlights the challenges of observing distant planets and interpreting faint signals from their atmospheres.</p>

Strategies for securing good CD rates include exploring online banks and considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study led by the University of Edinburgh, involving researchers from 20 institutions, challenges the "lab leak" theory of COVID-19's origin. Analyzing 167 bat coronavirus genomes, the study traces the virus's origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China, circulating five to seven years before the pandemic. The findings contradict claims from the White House that a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic. The study focused on sarbecoviruses, including Sars-CoV-1 and Sars-CoV-2, tracing the original Sars-CoV-1 to western China before its emergence in Guangdong.</p>
