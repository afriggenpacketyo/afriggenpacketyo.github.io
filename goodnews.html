          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, emerged as the champion of the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up in the previous year's competition. Zaki correctly spelled the word "eclaircissement" to secure his victory, marking a significant achievement after a challenging final round against other accomplished spellers. He is only the fifth runner-up to come back and win and the first since Sean Conley in 2001. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual event in the US where students compete to spell increasingly difficult words, showcasing their linguistic skills. The competition is a celebration of academic excellence and dedication to language. The annual spelling bee is a highly anticipated event that captures the attention of students, educators, and language enthusiasts nationwide.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan after a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency, requiring Japan to register fishery processing facilities and ensure seafood is free of radioactive substances. This development marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations between the two countries.</p>

This stance comes ahead of a fourth round of bilateral trade talks between Japan and the United States.</p>

She contends that the Conservative Party is the only major political party seriously examining the welfare state.
