          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Amidst Export Decline and Trade Negotiations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to falling exports. The GDP data was worse than economists' expectations, with exports dropping by 0.6% due to uncertainties from U.S. trade policies. Despite this, domestic demand showed a bright spot with a 0.6% increase, and economists anticipate a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. that could mitigate tariff impacts. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain current rates, potentially hiking later in the year if inflation targets are met, but remains wary of downside risks from global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics have announced a partnership with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service for spectators. If certified by the FAA in time, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft would offer short flights between Olympic venues. Archer aims to keep prices competitive with high-end Uber services, allowing customers to book flights via an app. Despite hurdles in battery density and regulatory approvals, the industry remains optimistic about the future of urban air travel, with Archer confident the Olympics will serve as a global showcase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is threatened by migrating humpback whales, leading to entanglements in fishing ropes. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve crab cages, reducing rope usage. While effective, the technology faces resistance due to cost and tradition, as it adds $50 per cage. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect whales, but fishermen using the experimental devices can continue fishing. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has questioned the authenticity of a recent Blue Origin space flight featuring an all-female crew, including Jeff Bezos' fianc√©e, Lauren Sanchez. O'Neal suggested that the trip may have involved green screen technology, citing inconsistencies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious hair of the passengers not moving in space. He argued that Bezos would not risk Sanchez's safety, leading him to believe the event was staged. Despite O'Neal's skepticism, Katy Perry, who was also on the flight, described the experience as "second to being a mom."</p>

A contingency plan is in place to accommodate 20% of daily riders if a strike occurs, with cross-honoring tickets on buses, light rail, and the MTA.

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge connecting the two continents. The study, published in Science, examined fossils including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, revealing mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. Researchers found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions. These migrations occurred during the last glacial interval.</p>

          <p>New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting access to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax for its COVID vaccine. Some experts fear the new federal limits could undermine the use of all vaccines, while others question the necessity of annual COVID shots for younger, healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, including which measures would be rolled back and at what pace, prompting discussions within Treasury to determine the implementation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision had been discussed and considered for weeks. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing its inability to pay salaries and rebuild infrastructure. Some of the most punitive measures were imposed on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for terrorist organizations.</p>
