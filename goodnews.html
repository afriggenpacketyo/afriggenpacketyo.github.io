          <p>Chelsea attacker Lauren James has made a significant return to the England women's football team after a three-month injury layoff, providing a crucial boost ahead of Euro 2025. In a friendly match against Jamaica, she made an immediate impact with an assist just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Her performance in the number 10 role has been widely praised, earning comparisons to England legend Kelly Smith and creating a selection dilemma for manager Sarina Wiegman. While she is still building match fitness, her creative talent is seen as a key asset for the Lionesses' title defense.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article delves into the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) in the context of the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The author argues that initial, hasty judgments about the effectiveness of the bombing are often unreliable, referencing historical examples from WWII and the Gulf War. The piece suggests that the cumulative effect of the 12-day campaign, the precision of modern munitions, and the sophistication of the delivery platforms likely resulted in severe damage to Iran's nuclear program. It concludes that a considered judgment requires time and the integration of multiple intelligence sources, cautioning against both official hyperbole and premature criticism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the U.S. over national security concerns. In a television interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and that a deal could be finalized soon. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed optimism that President Xi Jinping would agree. The president has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell the app, with the current deadline set for September 17.</p>
