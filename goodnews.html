          <p>Archaeologists have discovered an ancient purple dye factory in modern-day Israel, dating back to 1100 B.C. This site, Tel Shiqmona, is identified as a specialized facility for large-scale production of purple dye, which was highly valued in antiquity and mentioned in the Bible. The factory produced dye and dyed fibers/fleeces, indicating an efficient process. Researchers used chemical and mineralogical analyses to understand each artifact. The article describes the site as an industrial area, likely emitting a terrible odor, where wool fleeces were dyed in various shades of purple, red, and blue.</p>
