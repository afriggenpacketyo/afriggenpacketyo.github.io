          <p>A previously unreleased recording of the song ‚ÄúMe nace del coraz√≥n‚Äù by the late Mexican superstar Juan Gabriel has been released. The song, originally composed in the 1970s, was famously recorded by Spanish singer Roc√≠o D√∫rcal in 1978. This version features Juan Gabriel's own vocals, recorded shortly before his death in 2016, with a new musical arrangement by Guillermo Hern√°ndez Galicia, who served as Juan Gabriel's musical director for over two decades. The release is accompanied by performances from members of El Mariachi del Divo Alma de Ju√°rez, honoring the legacy of the iconic Latin American singer.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest, joining her sister Sunny who fledged earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, had been practicing for their first flights by flapping their wings and jumping between branches. While their exact whereabouts are unknown, young eagles typically return to the nest shortly after their first flight. The eaglets are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months before fully venturing out on their own.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their leadership roles with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and ODI series. While the victories were comprehensive, the article cautions against premature optimism, noting that England has historically struggled on the big stage despite dominating home series. The team faces tougher challenges ahead, including series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The question remains whether the "new" England can perform under pressure when it truly matters.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role leading the party's "Doge team" just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf had previously cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time." Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed delight at Yusuf's return, stating that he will now take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. Yusuf attributed his earlier resignation to exhaustion after 11 months of hard work and said he regretted his actions.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Reaches Deal to Restore Police Officer Hiring</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 13:25:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring that had been cut by the council. The deal aims to identify funds for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days, reversing a reduction in the number of officers hired in the coming fiscal year. The agreement comes after the council approved a budget that reworked much of Bass's plan for closing a $1-billion shortfall. The move reflects ongoing efforts to balance budget constraints with public safety priorities in Los Angeles.</p>
