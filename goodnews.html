          <p>After briefly reaching Category 5 status, Hurricane Erin has weakened slightly to a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 150 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm's center will remain at sea, passing north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands before curving away from the U.S. East Coast. A high-pressure system is expected to steer Erin offshore, though tropical storm watches have been issued for several Caribbean islands due to heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Erin is the first major hurricane of what is predicted to be an above-normal 2025 Atlantic season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are employing meticulous planning to feed their children during the six-week summer school holidays. Families are sharing tips such as stocking freezers with reduced "yellow-sticker" items, creating daily food bags to ration supplies, and organizing refrigerators by "use by" dates to minimize waste. Many are also relying on community food pantries, which have seen increased demand, as subsidized school meals are unavailable. These strategies have become essential for households navigating financial pressures from increased rent, mortgage, and childcare costs during the summer months.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has opened a new five-story vertical mausoleum, an architectural landmark designed to house approximately 13,000 people. The Gower Mausoleum provides a modern solution to urban death care by building upwards, featuring marble interiors, natural light, and views of Los Angeles. The cemetery, known for hosting cultural events like festivals and movie nights, is embracing innovative designs to meet community needs. This development reflects a broader trend in urban planning where cemeteries are adapting to population density by creating vertical final resting places.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021, just as they were returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from "Do you have a girlfriend yet?" to aspirations of attending university. Their teacher initiated the project to instill motivation during a period of disrupted education that shaped their entire secondary school experience. Reading the letters four years later served as a poignant reflection on their personal growth and resilience ahead of receiving their GCSE exam results.</p>

Using multicultural hubs like Singapore as a launchpad, brands are showcasing specific culinary traditions from regions like Hunan, Chongqing, and Xinjiang. This movement is driven by intense competition in the domestic Chinese market and a growing global appetite for more sophisticated and varied food experiences. These restaurants aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food as low-brow, instead presenting it as a rich and complex gastronomic culture.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" shines a light on the final burst of creativity from Elvis Presley, collecting music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. The collection, released near the 48th anniversary of his death, features his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage was ending. The article reflects on this period, suggesting that disappointment over losing a role in "A Star Is Born" may have contributed to a career decline before his death in 1977. The recordings showcase his evolution as an expressive singer and his strong rapport with his live TCB Band.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is largely attributed to Samsung's innovation in foldable screen technology, with models like the Z Fold 7 gaining significant traction and positive attention. By offering a wider range of devices at various price points, from budget phones to premium foldables, Samsung is competing aggressively against the relatively unchanged form factor of the iPhone. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer or foldable models in the near future to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>
