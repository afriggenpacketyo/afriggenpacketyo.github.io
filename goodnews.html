        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Constellation Energy's shares surged 15% after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy, representing the entire output of the plant's nuclear reactor, starting in June 2027. This agreement supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to expiring zero-emissions credits. The deal will expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts and contribute to Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity, though the plant will not directly power Meta's data centers.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has sparked anger in Wales, as it's classified as an England and Wales project despite having no tracks laid in Wales. Politicians argue that this classification denies Wales extra funding that could transform its own rail network. The UK government maintains that the project is funded through its rail network enhancements pipeline, which also supports projects in Wales. The Welsh government is seeking to fix the funding formula to prevent similar situations in the future.</p>

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s face a different kind of midlife crisis compared to previous generations, often lacking the financial stability to afford traditional markers of success. Many are seeking opportunities for personal growth and change, such as fitness journeys, career shifts, and tattoos, rather than interventions. Economic factors and societal pressures contribute to feelings of uncertainty and longing for security. Despite these challenges, millennials are often more equipped to navigate midlife in a healthy way, supported by diverse social circles and a focus on self-discovery.</p>
