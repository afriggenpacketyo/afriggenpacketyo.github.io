          <p>Romance fiction, particularly the romantasy subgenre, is experiencing a surge in sales and popularity, driven by the BookTok community on TikTok. This has led to changing attitudes towards the genre, which is often dismissed as "smut" by critics. Readers and industry experts highlight the strong world-building, character development, and plots found in many romance novels, which offer a comforting and entertaining escape. The growth in sales reflects a broader consumer trend among millennial women, who are driving the demand for both romance and fantasy books.</p>

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca expressed disappointment but stated that the red card would not affect Jackson's future with the team. Jackson apologized to his teammates for the incident, but Delap is now likely to start in the next match against ES Tunis and the Premier League season opener against Crystal Palace.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that his presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling supports civil liberties groups' argument that the mandate violates the separation of church and state. While the state's attorney general disagrees and plans to appeal, civil liberties groups say the ruling applies to all school districts in the state. The lawsuit was filed by parents from various religious backgrounds, who argued the law infringes on religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>
