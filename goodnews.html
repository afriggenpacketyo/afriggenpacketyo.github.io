          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes exceptions for specific groups, such as World Cup players, dual citizens, and individuals with existing visas, allowing them to enter the United States. The move comes as the administration tightens border security and restricts entry for nationals from several countries due to national security concerns. This exception ensures that international sporting events, like the World Cup, can proceed without disruption, while still maintaining the administration's broader immigration policies. The decision reflects a balance between security measures and the facilitation of international events and travel for certain individuals.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that from September 2026, all children in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals, regardless of their income. This change will extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 pupils and is viewed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a down payment on child poverty. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the changes would save parents ¬£500 annually and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029, with the government also considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap.</p>

The U.S. maintains its competitive edge due to large-scale public and private investment, a top-notch research workforce, and a decentralized innovation ecosystem. However, the report acknowledges that China is rapidly closing the gap in several sectors.

The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization reached $144 million, attributed to the lack of traditional bottom-line operational costs.

          <p>The United States anticipates that NATO members will eventually reach a defense spending target of 5% of their individual GDPs, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This target aligns with President Trump's demand to increase the current requirement of 2% of GDP. While some NATO members already exceed the 2% threshold, others lag behind, and no member has yet reached the 5% objective. The call for higher defense spending comes amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and the need to address threats from other global actors, reflecting the alliance's commitment to bolstering its defense capabilities.</p>

While best friendships can provide emotional support and reduce anxiety, there is also pressure to conform to certain expectations of what a best friendship should look like. Some teens express feeling guilty for not having a close connection with someone in their school or for not meeting the social media ideal of constant communication. Experts suggest that having a repertoire of supportive friends is more important than having one particular "best" friend.</p>
