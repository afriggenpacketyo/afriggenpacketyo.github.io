          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has officially installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, formerly a regional bishop in Chicago, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the church's first female leader. His installation comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, faces challenges including declining membership and theological debates. Curry aims to foster a more connected church, building on existing goals to create a welcoming and thriving community for all members.</p>

Russell's impressive performance marks his first pole since June and Mercedes' first in Singapore since 2018. Championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren will start third, ahead of his teammate and rival Lando Norris in fifth. The qualifying session was tense, with Verstappen blaming Norris for impeding his final lap, an incident Norris later dismissed as typical complaining from the Red Bull team.</p>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members for approximately half the typical retail price. Through its prescription program, members paying out-of-pocket can purchase a four-week supply for $499. This initiative aims to provide access to authentic versions of the high-demand drugs, as many consumers have turned to cheaper, unregulated compounded versions due to soaring costs and limited insurance coverage. The move could significantly increase access and demand for these medications.</p>

          <p>After two decades of meticulous restoration work, Egypt has opened the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The tomb, dating back over 3,000 years, is one of the largest in the valley and had suffered from severe deterioration. A Japanese-led project involving over 260 specialists worked to conserve the site, which is renowned for its exquisite wall paintings from the Eighteenth Dynasty. The project has been praised for adhering to the highest international standards for integrated conservation, preserving a vital piece of ancient history.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its acceptance of key components of a Gaza peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, which also involves a withdrawal of its military forces from the Gaza Strip. U.S. officials view the response as positive, though some details still require negotiation, with indirect talks expected to commence soon in Egypt. The development marks a potentially significant step towards ending the prolonged conflict that began in October 2023.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have added veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw to their roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This move comes after he was left off the roster for the wild-card round, marking a significant return for the future Hall of Famer in what is expected to be his final season. Kershaw, along with fellow left-hander Anthony Banda, will bolster the team's pitching staff, providing experience and a needed left-handed option against the Phillies' lineup. The decision ensures Kershaw will likely have at least one more opportunity to pitch in the postseason.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, the U.S. stock market continued its rally, with the S&P 500 achieving its 29th record-high close of the year. The healthcare and technology sectors performed strongly, partly due to a deal exempting Pfizer from tariffs and the continued boom in artificial intelligence. This article reviews recent market performance and portfolio adjustments, including new investments in Nike and Boeing, and trimming positions in Bristol Myers Squibb. Analysts also issued downgrades for Wells Fargo, GE Vernova, and Apple, citing various concerns from valuation to near-term growth catalysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, financial experts suggest that American investors may be overly concentrated in domestic assets and should consider increasing their exposure to international markets. This 'home bias' could cause investors to miss out on better value and growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. India, for example, is highlighted for its large population, favorable demographics, and rapid economic growth, which is driving consumption in a pattern similar to what was seen in China over the last two decades.
