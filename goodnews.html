          <p>Scholar Zheng Yongnian expresses concern over "intellectual colonialism" in the age of artificial intelligence, arguing that China's social sciences are overly reliant on Western theories. He contends that these Western-based systems fail to adequately explain non-Western civilizations like China's. To build a better AI and maintain its cultural identity, Zheng advocates for China to develop its own knowledge system rooted in its unique secular civilization. This approach, he believes, would allow China to play a more authentic and proper role in the international order.</p>

The Cincinnati Bengals secured a 2-0 start by beating the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-27, but their victory was overshadowed by a toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, whose status is now uncertain. Other notable results included the Detroit Lions routing the Chicago Bears 52-21 and the Buffalo Bills comfortably handling the New York Jets 30-10, a game in which Jets quarterback Justin Fields also left with a concussion.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 16:31:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid adoption of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating concern among traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor, diverting transactions that would otherwise generate revenue for card issuers. A significant issue for lenders is that BNPL usage often isn't reported to credit bureaus, creating a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for traditional financial institutions to accurately assess a borrower's total debt and credit risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The list also clarifies that corsets were primarily support garments, not torture devices, for most women and that the belief in a flat Earth was not widespread among educated people in the ancient world.

Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 298 yards and two touchdowns, one of which was his first to newly acquired receiver Davante Adams. Puka Nacua contributed significantly with a 45-yard touchdown run and 91 receiving yards, while the defense was anchored by Byron Young's two sacks. Despite the strong start to the season, the team now faces its most significant challenge yet, an upcoming game against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

Seville, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. The win fulfills the long-held expectations placed on the 24-year-old and suggests a resurgence for Jamaica in an event recently dominated by the United States.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Instead of spending his salary, Barkley lives off his endorsement deals and has invested in companies like AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink, as well as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This strategy was partly inspired by a serious injury in 2020, which reminded him of the finite length of an NFL career. His approach focuses on building long-term generational wealth by placing his earnings into both traditional index funds and higher-risk, high-reward tech ventures. (not investment advice)</p>
