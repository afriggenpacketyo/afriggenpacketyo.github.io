          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order committing the US to use all lawful and appropriate measures, including military action if necessary, to defend Qatar against external attack. This pledge, dated Monday but released Wednesday, aims to reassure Qatar following a recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha. The order cites the two nations' "close cooperation" and shared interests, declaring any armed attack on Qatar a threat to US peace and security. This unprecedented move underscores the strategic importance of Qatar, which hosts a major US military base, and comes after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed regret for the strike during a Washington visit.</p>

          <p>Renault is reportedly in advanced discussions with China's Chery Automobile to establish joint car manufacturing operations in South America, specifically targeting Colombia and Argentina. The potential partnership would grant Chery access to Renault’s existing factory network in return for providing crucial capital and product design expertise. Initial plans include producing combustion-engine cars, both Renault-badged and Chery-branded, in Colombia, and investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line in Argentina. This strategic collaboration aims to significantly expand both companies' presence in the burgeoning South American market, with Chery expected to fully fund these ambitious projects.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were arrested after they attempted to hang a banner on the iconic Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, according to local authorities. The group allegedly trespassed in the landmark area around noon and tried to attach a banner, which appeared to feature a green-and-white pill capsule, to one of the "O's." Police detained the individuals without incident, and city park rangers have since taken over the investigation. The specific message or purpose behind the attempted banner display remains unclear, but the swift action by law enforcement ensured minimal disruption to the famous landmark.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first person ever to achieve a net worth surpassing $500 billion, driven by the surging valuations of his companies, including Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. The Forbes' billionaires index briefly recorded his fortune at $500.1 billion, firmly cementing his status as the world's wealthiest individual. Tesla shares have notably risen over 14% this year, partly attributed to investors' approval of Musk's increased focus on his business ventures rather than politics.

Both South Korean tech giants saw their stock prices climb substantially, with Samsung gaining over 4% and SK Hynix more than 10%, as they are set to supply memory chips for OpenAI's advanced Stargate data centers. This positive market reaction occurred despite a higher-than-expected consumer price index increase in September and the ongoing US government shutdown.

          <p>In response to President Trump's declared war on drug cartels, Ecuador is intensifying its anti-drug operations, receiving substantial resources and military support from the United States. Ecuador, a crucial transit country for drug cartels, is increasing raids and cooperation with the US to avoid potential sanctions. A Sky News team observed police raids in Guayaquil, where officers, including a skilled drone pilot nicknamed "Lynx," target lower-level dealers to gather intelligence for dismantling higher-level networks. This enhanced collaboration aims to disrupt the vast global drug network, with the US planning to establish a military base in Ecuador to bolster these efforts.</p>

          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering practical guidance on selecting healthy options and their appropriate culinary uses. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils, despite some negative press, are beneficial due to their low saturated fat content and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing minimal trans fats, making them suitable for a balanced diet. The article explains that extra virgin olive oil is best suited for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, while vegetable or sunflower oils are recommended for deep frying because they withstand higher temperatures without breaking down.</p>
