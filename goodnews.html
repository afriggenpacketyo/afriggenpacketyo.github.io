        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the days following the assassination of its founder, Charlie Kirk, the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) has experienced a massive surge in interest. A TPUSA spokesperson reported receiving over 32,000 inquiries from individuals wanting to establish new college chapters, a significant number compared to its current 900. This influx suggests that the tragedy may be galvanizing support for the movement and accelerating Kirk's vision of expanding the organization's presence on campuses across America. Kirk's widow has vowed that the movement will not die but will instead become stronger and louder than ever before.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of seven prominent women's organizations in the UK has warned the government against weakening its flagship Employment Rights Bill. In a letter to the business secretary, the groups argued that proposed amendments from the House of Lords would undermine a 'once-in-a-generation' opportunity to tackle the gender pay gap. They highlighted that women are disproportionately affected by insecure work, such as zero-hours contracts, and would benefit most from the bill's original provisions. The organizations are urging ministers to deliver the legislation in full, without dilution, to advance gender equality and fulfill promises made to working people.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has become the new men's 100m world champion, ending a nine-year drought for Jamaica in the event since Usain Bolt's last global title. The 24-year-old sprinter ran a personal best of 9.77 seconds in Tokyo to claim the gold medal, leading a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. Seville's victory is seen as the dawn of a new era for Jamaican men's sprinting, fulfilling the long-held expectation that he would be the successor to the legendary Bolt. The win was particularly meaningful as Bolt, an inspiration and mentor to Seville, was in the crowd to witness the triumph.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. According to a recent report, his investments include stakes in AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Barkley adopted a strategy of living off his endorsement deals while investing his nearly $80 million in career salary and bonuses. This approach reflects his awareness of the limited lifespan of an NFL career and a desire to create long-term generational wealth for his family beyond his time on the football field.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign to become the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. In a speech in Sunderland, she urged the party to remain united to secure a second term in government and effectively counter the challenge from Reform UK. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue her active campaigning role if elected. The contest is viewed by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership, and Phillipson emphasized that internal division would only benefit political opponents like Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has started its Premier League title defense with four wins, all secured by goals scored in the final minutes of play, a trend now being dubbed 'Arne Time' after manager Arne Slot. This pattern of late-game heroics, reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, has become a defining characteristic of the team's early season performance. The team has already scored more goals in the 90th minute or later this season than in all of the previous one. While the need for last-minute winners suggests the team is not yet at its peak, it also demonstrates a powerful psychological edge and resilient winning mentality.</p>

          <p>The poem 'In the Beginning, There Was the Word,' by Ashley M. Jones, serves as a powerful meditation on the endurance of Black American identity and expression through history. It traces the journey from the holds of slave ships, where language was a form of spiritual power, to the Civil Rights Movement and the present day. The poem frames Black people as 'messengers' who carry a divine word of life and resilience, creating culture and prayer from 'the bones and scraps of america.' It celebrates the act of creation, whether through song, art, or protest, as a testament to an 'unstoppable' collective soul.</p>

          <p>The financial markets are keenly focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated. While a 25-basis-point reduction is expected, investors will be paying closest attention to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent statements for clues about the central bank's future plans. The decision comes after a period of mixed inflation data and slowing jobs growth, which Powell has previously indicated might warrant a policy adjustment. The Fed's forward guidance will be critical in shaping market sentiment and determining the direction of stocks for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by a recent wildfire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with a post-disaster drop in business. The group, founded by a resident who lost her own home, rotates weekly between different eateries, providing a vital economic boost and a space for community healing. For many members, who were strangers before the fire, the club has become a crucial support network where they can share experiences and forge new friendships. The initiative serves as a model for post-disaster recovery, demonstrating how grassroots efforts can help rebuild both a local economy and community bonds.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues for Eliminating U.S. Tipping Culture in Favor of a Living Wage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary critiques the pervasive tipping culture in the United States, arguing that the government's new 'no tax on tips' law only further enables a flawed system. The author contends that instead of creating complex tax deductions for tips, the focus should be on ensuring employers pay their workers a fair, living wage, as is common in many other countries. The article criticizes the temporary nature of the new tax benefit and questions the eligibility list, which includes professions like 'digital content creators' but excludes others like teachers and postal workers. The ultimate solution proposed is to ban tips altogether and force a shift toward higher base wages.</p>
