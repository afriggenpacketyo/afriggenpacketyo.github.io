          <p>Dollar General is upgrading its financial forecast for the year, standing out from other retailers amid tariffs and tightening consumer budgets. The company reported a 2.4% sales increase from February through April, attributing it to shoppers trading down from more expensive stores. While CEO Todd Vasos acknowledges potential price increases due to tariffs, the chain is attracting more lower and middle-income shoppers seeking deals. The company forecasts net sales to grow between 3.7% and 4.7% for the year, assuming current tariff rates remain in place through mid-August (not investment advice). The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>This article explores the possibility of debt forgiveness for personal loans, noting that it is less common than with student loans. Debt settlement, where lenders accept less than the full amount owed, is a potential option for borrowers facing financial hardship. To qualify, borrowers typically need to be behind on payments, demonstrate financial hardship, and be prepared to make a lump-sum offer. If debt forgiveness is not an option, borrowers can explore debt management plans, refinancing, or consolidation to make payments more manageable (not investment advice).

          <p>This article analyzes the debate within the Democratic Party regarding whether to prioritize fighting corporate power or reducing red tape. A recent poll suggests voters prefer a candidate focused on combating corporate influence, but the author argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these two approaches. The author suggests that focusing on material benefits, such as increased housing and infrastructure, may be more effective than relying on populist rhetoric. The article concludes that the debate is primarily about policy and governance, rather than politics. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>This article chronicles the life and political career of Lee Jae-myung, who is expected to become South Korea's next president. Lee's politics are rooted in his impoverished youth, which included working in factories as a teenager. He overcame these challenges to become a human rights lawyer and eventually the mayor of Seongnam, where he implemented welfare policies. His recent election victory is attributed to a desire to restore democratic norms and offer a "thick safety mat" to vulnerable citizens. The optimism score is 80.</p>
