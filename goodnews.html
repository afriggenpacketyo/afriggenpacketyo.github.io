          <p>Shares of China's electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price reductions on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models. Analysts from Citi anticipate that these price cuts will lead to a substantial increase in foot traffic at BYD's dealerships. However, the price cuts have sparked investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war within the electric vehicle sector, leading to declines in the shares of other Chinese automakers as well. Citi analysts remain optimistic about sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

          <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, is targeting Tesla's Model Y with its newly unveiled YU7 electric SUV, which was revealed in Beijing and slated for a July launch. The YU7 boasts a longer driving range than Tesla's Model Y, potentially attracting consumers concerned about frequent charging. Analysts predict the YU7 will be priced competitively and could significantly impact Tesla's market share in China, with projected monthly sales of around 30,000 units. Xiaomi's entry into the electric vehicle market signifies intensifying competition in China's automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to major retailers, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi seeks to lower prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June in an effort to alleviate pressure on household budgets amid rising inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through this new system, bypassing the auction system that previously limited government influence over prices. Koizumi's appointment and the new measures come after criticism of the government's handling of rising rice costs, and public opinion appears receptive to the changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. Companies must meet specific criteria, including having at least two sales involving independent parties and proving the item was destined for the U.S. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid increasing tariffs, offering potential cost savings for businesses willing to navigate the additional complexities.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, signaling a move to reduce reliance on imported seafood through offshore aquaculture. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, costing 600 million yuan, is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually and can quickly relocate to avoid adverse weather conditions. The ship also features an onboard processing facility, enabling rapid delivery of fresh salmon to domestic markets. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening the nation's food security amid global challenges.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep helps the brain enter repair mode to clean up free radicals. The research published in Cell Metabolism deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The team found that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease</p>
