        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a slower decline of 1.5% in July, marking the smallest contraction since May, according to official statistics. This improvement is attributed to government efforts to curb overcapacity and aggressive price competition among producers. While manufacturing sector profits rose, overall profit margins remain pressured by softened domestic demand and persistent deflationary trends. Policy measures are gradually driving a recovery in corporate profitability, but challenges persist in the broader economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Luxury parka maker Canada Goose is attracting take-private bids valued at approximately $1.35 billion, as its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, explores an exit. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, with other interested buyers including Bosideng International and a consortium of FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product. This potential privatization comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum in key markets and questions surrounding its brand positioning. Bain Capital's 12-year control has exceeded typical private equity investment cycles, making an exit a natural progression. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Tiangong space station has surpassed the International Space Station (ISS) in a key area of heated space research, specifically in container-free material processing. Scientists on Tiangong successfully conducted experiments using electrostatic levitation to heat tiny metal samples to around 3,000 degrees Celsius, eliminating contamination from physical containers. These findings, developed by Hu Liang's team, are crucial for designing advanced tungsten alloys and ultra-high-temperature materials for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles. This achievement underscores the reliability of Tiangong's laboratory cabinet and advances fundamental research in aerospace applications.</p>

          <p>The city of Anaheim is seeking to determine the long-term viability of Angel Stadium, known as the Big A, as its 60th anniversary approaches next year. With the Angels' lease extending through 2032, the city is awaiting a comprehensive assessment, expected in mid-2026, to estimate the hundreds of millions of dollars needed for future renovations or replacement. This comes after a 2022 deal for Angels owner Arte Moreno to buy the stadium and surrounding land was canceled due to a federal corruption investigation. Currently, no long-term discussions are taking place between the city and the team.</p>
