          <p>Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism at the 157th Belmont Stakes in Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Kentucky Derby's top finishers. Sovereignty, with jockey Junior Alvarado, secured the win on a fast track after earlier rain, while Journalism finished second and Baeza third, mirroring the Derby's results. This victory makes Sovereignty the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont; the last horse to win both the Derby and Belmont, while running all three legs of the Triple Crown, was Thunder Gulch in 1995. The Belmont was held at Saratoga due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is considering changes to airline baggage rules following numerous complaints about inconsistent and confusing hand luggage policies. EU transport ministers have proposed standardized sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines to add clarity to existing regulations. Consumer groups argue the proposals don't go far enough, as airlines could continue charging for overhead cabin bags. Budget airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low, but pressure is mounting for fairer and more consistent rules to reduce passenger confusion and unexpected fees.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria, aiming to replace antibiotic-resistant bugs in the gut. Early data suggests this approach can flush out superbugs and restore a healthy gut microbiome, and faecal transplants are already approved for treating severe diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile. Researchers are optimistic that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs and promote better gut health, highlighting the importance of gut bacteria in overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are scrambling to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity rules, as inspectors conduct checks on office modesty, meal receipts, and lavish gifts. The campaign, ongoing since 2012, aims to improve the Communist Party's image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the effort ensures resources are spent wisely in China's rivalry with the United States, and identifies politically loyal cadres for promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to media control and enforcement challenges.</p>
