          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white South Africans of Dutch descent, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. This marks the first group accepted under President Trump's executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination in South Africa. The move has sparked controversy, with critics noting the economic privilege of Afrikaners compared to other vulnerable groups. States including Colorado, Massachusetts, and New York have agreed to resettle the South Africans, who will now have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and government benefits.</p>

Said also addresses the lack of diverse body types in popular media, stating that he wanted to showcase more realistic representations in his film.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the start date be moved back to 1931, with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism, which they argue has been diminished by the "Western-centric" view. The proposal comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow to mark the surrender of Nazi Germany.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement maintains a 10% baseline tariff on most goods but is seen as setting the tone for reciprocal trade with other partners. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as boosting trade and protecting jobs, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected a $5 billion opportunity for new exports by American farmers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, up to a certain quantity. This signals a major shift in India's protectionist trade policies, possibly motivated by Trump's tariffs on Indian exports. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and experts believe that reducing trade barriers is essential for India's economic growth. Some analysts believe that the zero-tariff deal will not significantly harm domestic businesses.</p>

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary, "Pavements," explores the legacy of the 90s indie rock band Pavement through a blend of tour footage, a staged musical, an art gallery exhibition, and a faux-Hollywood biopic. The film seeks to capture the band's essence by presenting them as "the world‚Äôs most important and influential band," even though they never achieved mainstream success. By combining different angles and embracing the band's creative unruliness, Perry creates a whimsical and thought-provoking exploration of Pavement's impact on music and culture.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported weaker than expected first quarter earnings due to inclement weather, but positive sales momentum in April is giving investors some hope. The restaurant chain's comparable store sales increased 5% year over year through the first five weeks of the second quarter. Management reaffirmed most of its outlook for 2025, except for raising its commodity cost inflation outlook to approximately 4%. While maintaining a positive rating on the stock, analysts have reduced the price target to $195 per share from $205 due to margin pressure from higher commodity inflation.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association's enforcement of skort wearing in matches has ignited a debate about sexism and player comfort, with calls for players to have the option to wear shorts. County and club teams have pressured the association to relax the rule, with the issue gaining prominence after the Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before a match. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to choose shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue.</p>

They attribute their resurgence to a new generation discovering their music, the cyclical nature of trends, and the anthemic quality of their songs. The artists also reflect on the challenges facing new artists, including the shrinking live scene and the shift in music consumption from sales to streams. They recall the grind of early tours and the impact of music publications like the NME.</p>

Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews, but is now having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.</p>
