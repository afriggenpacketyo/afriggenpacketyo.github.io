          <p>China is constructing a massive 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, dubbed a "project of the century" due to extreme engineering challenges and cost. The line will traverse treacherous terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost, at an average altitude over 4,500 meters. With an estimated investment of up to 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), it is set to be one of China's most expensive rail projects, aiming to enhance connectivity and strategic presence in the remote regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues during the initial registration phase at ports, airports, and train terminals.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to secure a place in the upcoming men's World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's failure to qualify for the 2022 tournament. He specifically referenced the painful 3-1 play-off defeat to Ukraine, which ended their hopes for a spot in Qatar. Clarke, who has successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, is now focused on overcoming this lingering disappointment and ending a 28-year absence from the World Cup finals.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein has sparked a public debate over religious accommodations after it formalized the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays. While some media outlets misleadingly framed this as "extra holidays," the policy merely affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to allowances made for Christian denominations. The situation highlights Germany's ongoing national conversation about integration, equality, and its evolving religious demographics.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Genetic Switches Enabling a Single Plant Cell to Regenerate into a Full Plant</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of researchers from China and the Netherlands has identified the mechanism that allows a single differentiated plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. The study, published in the journal Cell, reveals that flipping two specific genetic switches can initiate a process known as somatic embryogenesis, where non-reproductive cells regain the ability to form an embryo. This discovery provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>

          <p>Following a summer transfer window dominated by high-profile striker acquisitions, this article assesses how nine new forwards have fared in the initial matches of the Premier League season. Players like Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike have made strong starts, contributing goals and integrating well into their top-tier clubs. In contrast, others, such as Alexander Isak at Liverpool and Thierno Barry at Everton, are having a slower start, still seeking to find their form and justify their significant transfer fees in the highly competitive league.</p>

          <p>Despite breaking scoring records for both England and his club teams, an analysis questions whether striker Harry Kane receives the appreciation his consistent brilliance deserves. Now at Bayern Munich, Kane continues to score at a prolific rate, recently becoming the fastest player to reach 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top leagues. While he holds England's all-time scoring record, some critics point to his lack of major tournament trophies, though pundits argue his all-around skill and goalscoring prowess place him among the world's elite players.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion in loans from China, originally denominated in US dollars, into Chinese yuan in a strategic move to reduce its debt-servicing costs. The conversion, primarily for loans used to finance the Standard Gauge Railway, is expected to save the country US$215 million annually. Analysts suggest this debt restructuring could serve as a model for other debt-distressed African nations and may strengthen their economic ties with Beijing, offering an alternative to Western-led financial systems.

          <p>University of Southern California's football team secured a significant 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, powered by an unexpected breakout performance from walk-on running back King Miller. After USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries, Miller, a redshirt freshman, stepped up and rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown. His performance was instrumental in the win, which boosts USC's season prospects and challenges the perception that the team lacks the physicality to compete with top Big Ten opponents.</p>

          <p>Alison Davis has been found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who was found with fatal head injuries at the bottom of their home's staircase in 2023. Prosecutors argued that the multiple skull fractures were consistent with a beating and that Alison's behavior was suspicious, but they never found a murder weapon. The defense successfully countered that Kevin, who was intoxicated, suffered a single, catastrophic impact by hitting his head on the banister post during an accidental fall. After 17 months in jail, Alison Davis was freed following the jury's verdict.</p>

The Brewers, despite a significantly smaller payroll, have built a formidable team based on a "small-ball" offensive approach, disciplined pitching, and strategic management. Key strengths include a deep pitching staff anchored by ace Freddy Peralta, a relentless offense that excels at getting on base and manufacturing runs, and the impactful relief work of rookie flamethrower Jacob Misiorowski, who previously dominated the Dodgers.</p>
