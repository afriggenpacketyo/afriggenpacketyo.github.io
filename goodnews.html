          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the age-related aspects of buying annuities as a retirement planning tool, noting that while there are no federal age limits, individual insurers often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85. It explains that the timing of a purchase significantly affects costs and returns, with different age ranges offering distinct advantages. The piece suggests that the best age depends on an individual's retirement strategy, health, and financial goals rather than a specific number, advising a balance between higher payouts for older buyers and the risk of reduced product availability.

          <p>President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy met at the White House, where Trump indicated a ceasefire is not essential for a peace deal and stated the U.S. would provide Ukraine with "very good protection" without offering specifics. This meeting, which included a delegation of European leaders, was more cordial than their previous encounter, with Trump pushing for a trilateral summit with Russian President Putin to negotiate an end to the war. Trump also mentioned he would call Putin following the meetings, signaling a continued diplomatic effort to broker a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Meta Platforms declined following a report that the company is restructuring its AI team for the fourth time in six months, raising concerns about its strategy despite heavy investment in AI talent. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's stock remained stable after its competitor, Novo Nordisk, reduced the cash price of its diabetes drug Ozempic. The market's muted reaction is attributed to the fact that the price cut targets the less significant cash-pay market for diabetes treatments, as most patients have insurance coverage, unlike obesity medications where direct-to-consumer platforms are more crucial.

Notable additions include "skibidi," a versatile term from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a playful version of delusional that has even been used in political discourse. Other new entries like "tradwife," "broligarchy," and "lewk" reflect current social trends and the significant influence of online communication on the evolution of the English language.

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflects on his journey to the show, which he says was never a direct goal despite being voted "Most Likely to be on SNL" in high school. He discusses how pop culture, including SNL, was a crucial tool for him to assimilate after moving from French-speaking Canada to Colorado as a child of Chinese immigrants. Yang also shares insights into his creative process, his Emmy-nominated performances, and his popular podcast "Las Culturistas," which celebrates culture in a maximalist and humorous way.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify report examines the extent of U.S. aid to Ukraine, finding that the total commitment is approximately $130.6 billion, according to the Kiel Institute, a figure significantly lower than some political claims. The analysis clarifies that while the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, Europe as a whole has contributed more, committing around $165.7 billion. The report also addresses the nature of the aid, noting that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has offered more in grants.</p>

This rate represents a historic low, declining from 42.8% in the year 2000, challenging the administration's stated reason for the dismissal, which cited concerns about conflicts. The research indicates that financial ties related to personal income on both the CDC and FDA vaccine panels have been below 1% since 2016, suggesting significant progress in managing such conflicts.</p>

          <p>The US Open mixed doubles tournament has been revamped this year, featuring a condensed schedule, a $1 million prize for the winners, and a star-studded lineup of top singles players like Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, and Carlos Alcaraz. This new format aims to generate more fan interest but has drawn criticism from doubles specialists, many of whom were unable to enter because entry was based on singles rankings. While some players express excitement for the high-profile matchups, others, including members of the WTA player council, have questioned the USTA's lack of consultation in making such a significant change.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people using the new over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception. The research, based on a survey of nearly 1,000 users, also showed a significant shift from less-effective methods like condoms. The findings suggest that removing the prescription requirement is successfully reducing barriers to access, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that includes an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of about half of the remaining Israeli hostages, followed by negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated a preference for a deal that releases all hostages at once. The development comes amid intense Israeli military operations in Gaza and growing domestic pressure in Israel.</p>
