          <p>During a visit to Shanghai, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reiterated his country's long-standing bipartisan policy of supporting the "status quo" regarding Taiwan. He emphasized that Australia opposes any unilateral actions that could disrupt peace and security in the region. This statement comes amid reports of U.S. officials pressing allies on their potential roles in a Taiwan conflict and is a key topic for discussion during Albanese's meetings with Chinese leaders this week. The visit also included efforts to promote Australian tourism to Chinese travelers.</p>

          <p>While the NFL has embraced the opportunity to grow its global brand by committing players to flag football in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Major League Baseball has yet to make a similar commitment. Top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have expressed a desire to compete, which could create a 'Dream Team' scenario and significantly boost the sport's international profile. However, MLB faces logistical challenges, including interrupting its season and navigating media contracts. The delay raises questions about whether baseball will miss a key marketing opportunity on the world's largest sporting stage.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has stated that the government is looking into further actions to enhance online safety for children, building on existing regulations. New age-verification rules, overseen by the media regulator Ofcom, are set to take effect this month, requiring internet companies to implement stricter checks and filter harmful content from children's feeds. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized that these rules are a foundation, not the end of the conversation. Ofcom's chief has vowed to rigorously enforce the new requirements but acknowledged that new legislation may be needed to address the rapid development of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crises, California is creating its first dedicated, cabinet-level housing agency. The new agency is the result of a government reorganization proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom, which splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two entities. Supporters believe this move will elevate housing issues to the highest level of state government and help streamline the state's complex network of affordable housing finance programs. While critics question if a bureaucratic reshuffle will be effective, advocates see it as a crucial first step toward more coordinated and efficient policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion column suggests that LeBron James, now playing on a one-year expiring contract for the first time in his career, could look to Kobe Bryant's 2015 retirement announcement as a model for his own career endgame. The author notes that with the Lakers seemingly building around Luka Doncic, James's future with the team is uncertain. By announcing his retirement ahead of his final season, Bryant controlled his own narrative and experienced a celebrated farewell tour, which allowed fans nationwide to show their appreciation. The piece argues that a similar approach could provide a graceful and celebrated exit for James.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" cyborgs by embedding microelectric controllers into moon jellyfish, enabling them to be remotely controlled for ocean data collection. These devices can trigger muscle contractions to guide the jellyfish's movement, allowing them to gather environmental data on temperature and pressure in specific locations. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane. The low-cost, scalable technology aims to make ocean research more accessible and could redefine how scientists monitor the vast and mysterious depths of the ocean.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the final fight of the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy, framing it as a transcendent moment for women's boxing that highlights the meaning of choice and equality in the sport. The author argues that the tactical, less chaotic nature of the third fight represents progress, as it shows women fighters have earned the right to be strategic and even 'boring' to secure a win, just like their male counterparts. The piece also explores the sport's contradictions, where female athletes fight for glory and autonomy in an environment that still often objectifies them and offers unequal pay.</p>

The rock is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The auction also features the skeleton of a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur.</p>
