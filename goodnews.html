        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to homes and businesses in the United Kingdom. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, Tesla could enter the UK energy market, leveraging its existing base of electric vehicle and home battery storage customers. The move comes as Tesla faces increased competition and a recent decline in its European electric vehicle sales. This strategic expansion into energy supply mirrors a similar model Tesla already operates in Texas, where it provides power and incentivizes customers to feed surplus electricity back into the grid.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks secured a dramatic 94-91 victory against the Seattle Storm, thanks to a game-winning layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining. The Sparks had to rally from a 16-point first-quarter deficit, with Kelsey Plum playing a crucial role in the comeback, finishing with 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. The hard-fought win marks the Sparks' ninth victory in their last 11 games, strengthening their position in the WNBA playoff race.

          <p>The government of England and Wales is planning a significant overhaul of road safety regulations, which includes making eye tests compulsory for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes are prompted by concerns that current safety messaging is ineffective and follow a coroner's report criticizing the UK's "lax" driver licensing system regarding eyesight. A government source indicated that these measures are necessary to reduce the high number of road fatalities and injuries.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones create a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. When a black hole is created from a star's collapse or the merger of other massive objects, the resulting distortion in spacetime quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. During this brief, violent formation process, the black hole "rings" like a bell, emitting gravitational waves that represent its fundamental properties. These vibrations, a prediction of general relativity, offer a way for scientists to study these enigmatic objects before they become silent and introverted.</p>

          <h2>China's New Childcare Subsidies May Disproportionately Benefit Less Affluent Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (approximately $501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant impact in poorer regions, where the subsidy represents a much larger percentage of the average resident's income. For example, the payment equates to over 13.5% of an average income in Gansu province, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai. Analysts suggest this could lead to a noticeable boost in consumption and potentially a modest increase in birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is making a monumental bet on the future of artificial intelligence, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI), or AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans, will arrive within a decade. Son is positioning SoftBank to be at the forefront of this revolution through massive investments in AI-related firms, including chip designer Arm and OpenAI. This aggressive strategy mirrors his historically successful early investment in Alibaba. Despite past setbacks with the Vision Fund, Son's long-held vision is to create a comprehensive AI ecosystem, from semiconductors and infrastructure to robotics and applications, to drive long-term value.

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship after a tense, three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, held his nerve to secure the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke short of the playoff, tied for third. For Rose, the victory was a gratifying return to form and his 12th career PGA Tour title.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at making it easier for newly qualified nurses and midwives in England to secure jobs within the National Health Service (NHS). The changes, which include cutting red tape and allowing trusts to hire proactively based on anticipated needs, address a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. This surplus is attributed to a surge in trainees during the pandemic combined with lower-than-expected attrition rates. While nursing unions welcomed the move, employer groups raised concerns about how the new hires would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' preseason game against the Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance that appears to be closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, using his legs to extend drives and scoring a touchdown on a designed run, finishing with 48 rushing yards. In contrast, his competitor Taylor Heinicke appeared rusty in his first preseason action. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Lance's decision-making and the value of his game-time experience, suggesting a real competition is emerging behind starter Justin Herbert.</p>
