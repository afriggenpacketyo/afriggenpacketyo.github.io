          <p>OpenAI has secured a $200 million contract with the U.S. Defense Department to provide artificial intelligence tools, marking its first contract with the department. This contract follows OpenAI's announcement of collaborating with defense technology startup Anduril to deploy advanced AI systems for national security missions. The Defense Department specified that the contract is with OpenAI Public Sector LLC, with work primarily occurring in the National Capital Region. OpenAI is also working to expand its computing power in the U.S., including the $500 billion Stargate project to build AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reduced the hours of the nightly curfew in downtown Los Angeles, allowing businesses to remain open later into the evening due to diminishing protests and reduced crime. The curfew, which previously began at 8 p.m., will now start at 10 p.m., continuing to lift at 6 a.m. Bass enacted the curfew in response to chaotic protests following President Trump's immigration crackdown in Southern California, as well as looting and vandalism. The LAPD has arrested 575 people since protests began on June 7, including 14 for looting, but arrests have dropped in recent days.</p>

          <h2>Judge Rules Trump Administration's NIH Grant Cuts 'Void and Illegal'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal," citing unlawful discrimination. Judge William Young stated that the cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), represented "racial discrimination and discrimination against America's LGBTQ community." The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration. The American Public Health Association and other health experts filed suit, arguing the cuts targeted research connected to race, gender identity, vaccines, or equity.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Proposes Misdemeanor for Officers Who Cover Their Faces on Duty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:50:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers are proposing a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while conducting official business. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name or other identifier. Exemptions would be made for the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal comes amid concerns about federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges, raising questions about accountability.</p>
