          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, urging member states to bolster artificial intelligence cooperation while denouncing a 'Cold War mentality.' The summit, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amid ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, aiming to foster a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc. The gathering is expected to conclude with a joint statement on strengthening security, economic, and cultural ties among its now ten member states.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5. This figure, which indicates expansion, surpassed Reuters' economist estimates and marked the fastest growth rate since March, partly attributed to a prolonged trade truce with the U.S. The improvement was driven by a recovery in new export orders, showcasing resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, muted gains in overall output and new orders suggest domestic demand remains weak, and rising raw material costs are prompting businesses to pass on expenses to consumers.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, signaling a potential warming of relations amidst U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian imports. The meeting, which saw promises to work through differences, reflects India's policy of 'strategic autonomy' as it balances ties with both the U.S. and China. Despite a brief border conflict in 2020 and a burgeoning trade deficit with China, India is seeking new opportunities after facing pressure from a trusted ally. The renewed synergy, however, could face geopolitical challenges, particularly with India hosting the Quad summit, a forum often seen as a counter to China's regional dominance.</p>

These plans, which would involve potentially tens of thousands of troops, are reportedly backed by the United States, with President Trump having reassured European leaders of an American presence. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also stated that Germany is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing that a quick end at Ukraine's expense is not an option. The arrangements were reportedly agreed upon during a meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and senior European leaders in August.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott shared his perspective on the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Prescott, the NFL's highest-paid player, stated he wasn't surprised by the move, attributing it to the personal nature of Parsons' contract negotiations with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The trade saw Parsons become the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL with a four-year, $188 million deal, while Dallas acquired two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Prescott expressed relief that the tension between Parsons and Jones had reached a resolution, avoiding ongoing distractions for the team.</p>

          <h2>Report Explores Feasibility and Risks of Australia's Under-16 Social Media Ban</h2>

          <p>A new report has found that while Australia's upcoming social media ban for under-16s is technically feasible using various technologies, all methods present risks and shortcomings. The ban, set to begin in December, aims to mitigate the harmful effects of social media on children, requiring platforms to take 'reasonable steps' for age verification. Identity document verification is deemed most accurate but raises privacy concerns regarding data retention and sharing. Facial assessment technology, while 92% accurate for adults, has a 'buffer zone' around age 16, leading to potential inaccuracies. The report recommends layered approaches, with the Communications Minister emphasizing industry responsibility to implement effective age checks.</p>

Despite missing revenue estimates, the Chinese tech giant reported a 78% increase in net income, largely due to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The cloud division's revenue grew 26% year-on-year, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Alibaba is heavily investing in AI and 'quick commerce,' aiming to maintain cloud growth above market average. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite current U.S.-China tensions, the legacy of these heroes, credited with destroying nearly 500 Japanese planes, remains strong in China. The bond is so significant that the daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder are among the few Americans invited to Beijing's military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of WWII's end.

This mission aims to prepare for future manned missions and demonstrate Canadian technology, building on the country's rich history in space. Engineers face significant challenges, including surviving extreme lunar temperatures ranging from -200C to 100C and navigating the abrasive regolith surface.

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion has begun, offering 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a 'landmark moment' for working families, providing significant financial relief. However, parents are encountering long waiting lists for places, with nurseries reporting staff shortages limiting availability despite a rise in available spaces. Research suggests the sector needs 35,000 more staff, and issues like low pay and retention remain persistent challenges. Confusion also exists around 'free' childcare, as providers often charge additional fees to cover shortfalls in government funding rates.</p>
