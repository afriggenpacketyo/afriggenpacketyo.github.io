          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition affecting blood flow in the leg veins. The diagnosis came after the president noticed swelling in his legs, prompting a comprehensive examination which ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. According to his physician, the condition is "benign and common," particularly for his age group, and does not impact his overall excellent health. The White House also clarified that separate bruising on his hand was due to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, not the vein condition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is set to sign winger Bryan Mbeumo after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid, which could rise to £70 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old Cameroon international is expected to be United's third major signing of the summer, following Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. Mbeumo is noted for his versatility, work rate, and goal-scoring threat, having contributed significantly to Brentford's attack. The transfer represents Brentford's largest-ever sale and is seen as a move by United's new manager, Ruben Amorim, to add a reliable and proven Premier League player to strengthen his forward line for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are heading into their Test series against the Wallabies as unprecedented favorites, a rare status for the touring side in Australia. Polls and bookmakers alike are predicting a Lions victory, with many even forecasting a 3-0 clean sweep. This sentiment is fueled by Australia's recent form and key injuries, including the absence of star players Rob Valetini and Will Skelton. While the Lions possess a powerful and creative squad, some commentators hope for a strong Australian challenge to create a memorable and hard-fought series, rather than a one-sided affair, to truly test the Lions' mettle.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a Pilates instructor recounts her journey from pandemic-induced isolation and depression to finding love in Los Angeles. Feeling trapped in her small studio with two incompatible dogs, she reluctantly reactivated her Bumble account and connected with a writer from Boston. After a successful first date that ended with a perfect beach kiss, disaster struck when her rescue dog, Valiente, bit her date's leg and drew blood. To her surprise, he brushed it off, leading to a second date and, eventually, a marriage proposal. The couple now jokes that their relationship was "love at first bite."</p>

          <p>Chevron has prevailed in its arbitration dispute with Exxon Mobil over Hess Corporation's valuable oil assets in Guyana. The ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce removes a major obstacle, allowing Chevron to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess. The dispute centered on Exxon's claim that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's 30% stake in the prolific Stabroek Block oil development. In a statement, Exxon said it disagreed with the panel's interpretation but would respect the decision and welcomed Chevron to the joint venture, which also includes China's CNOOC.</p>

          <p>China's government has committed to stimulating its service sector by cutting restrictive measures and encouraging foreign investment over the next five years. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao acknowledged a "shortage of high-quality service on the supply side" and stated that reforms would target sectors like healthcare and elderly care. This strategic shift aims to bolster domestic demand as a more reliable engine for economic growth, especially given the uncertainties in international trade. The initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to rebalance its economy and compensate for a complicated global trade environment, including ongoing tensions with the United States.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Policies Are Shifting Public Opinion to Be More Favorable Toward Immigrants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an analysis of recent polling data suggesting a significant reversal in American attitudes toward immigration, with public sentiment becoming more positive since Donald Trump took office. After years of growing restrictionist views, a majority of Americans now see immigration as a good thing for the country, and support for pro-immigrant policies like legalization has increased. The author posits this is a "thermostatic" reaction, where the public moves in the opposite direction of a president's policy agenda. While Americans may have supported Trump's ideas in theory, seeing the practical implementation of his harsh policies appears to be souring their views.</p>

          <p>Shares in Swedish defense manufacturer Saab jumped over 14% after the company reported second-quarter profits and sales that significantly beat analyst expectations. The company's operating income saw a 49% year-on-year increase, driven by what its CEO described as "really high" activity in the European defense market. Saab also raised its full-year sales growth forecast, reflecting the broader trend of increased defense spending across Europe and by NATO members. The stock's strong performance is part of a regional surge for defense companies as nations bolster their security budgets in response to geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American rap icon Snoop Dogg has officially become a co-owner of the Welsh football club Swansea City, joining an ownership group that took over the team last year.

In a statement, Snoop Dogg said the story of the "underdog" club and its working-class city resonated with him. The move is seen as an effort to boost the club's global profile and revenue, similar to the success rival Welsh team Wrexham has seen under its Hollywood ownership.</p>

Gentine also suggests creating a formal development and termination plan, potentially involving independent directors, to make difficult decisions less personal and ensure the enterprise remains competitive and professionally managed.

          <p>British boxer Daniel Dubois is preparing for a high-stakes rematch against unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk at Wembley Stadium. Two years after a defeat in Poland, Dubois aims to leverage his home advantage and recent victories to "seize the moment." A key point of contention from their first fight was a fifth-round punch from Dubois that floored Usyk but was ruled a low blow, a moment Dubois's team felt was mishandled. To win, analysts suggest Dubois must be more aggressive, effectively use body shots, and avoid letting the highly skilled Usyk control the fight's rhythm as he did in their initial encounter.</p>
