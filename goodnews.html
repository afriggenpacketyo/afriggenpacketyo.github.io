          <h2>UK Government Considers Expanding Ban on Destructive Bottom Trawling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 05:22:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the prohibition of bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, in English waters. The proposal aims to increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. This move follows warnings from environmental advocates like Sir David Attenborough, who highlighted the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where pressure is mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which seeks to protect 30% of international waters. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking input from the marine and fishing sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts discuss the importance of magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 bodily enzyme systems, including energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium deficiency, common in the U.S., can lead to health issues like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of deficiency include insomnia, muscle cramps, and fatigue, and while blood tests can help detect low levels, they aren't foolproof. While magnesium is best obtained through dietary sources like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, supplements may be recommended in certain cases, such as alcoholism or when taking certain medications, but it is important to consult with a physician before starting any supplementation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), initially designed for diabetes management, are now marketed to non-diabetics, raising questions about their actual health benefits. These devices track blood sugar levels continuously, providing data on how different foods impact glucose levels, however studies have yielded mixed results regarding their effectiveness in weight loss or blood sugar control for the general population. Some individuals may benefit from CGMs if they are highly sensitive to carbohydrates or need extra motivation to eat healthier, while others may find the data confusing or misleading. Experts emphasize that CGMs are just one metric and should be used in the context of overall health and awareness, and that continuous glucose monitoring is not necessarily for everyone.</p>

          <p>China appears to be easing export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets for U.S. and European auto giants, following warnings of potential production threats. China's Ministry of Commerce is willing to establish a "green channel" for eligible export license applications to expedite the approval process for European Union firms. The move comes after trade talks between Chinese and EU officials, with Beijing also granting rare earth licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis. These actions signal a potential de-escalation in trade tensions, though questions remain about the scope and impact of the measures.</p>
