          <p>Recent developments suggest a strong rebound in dealmaking activity, which is considered a bullish indicator for Goldman Sachs' investment banking division. The firm was selected as a financial advisor for the massive leveraged buyout of video game publisher Electronic Arts, which is set to be the largest in U.S. history. Additionally, strong quarterly results from competitor Jefferies, driven by record advisory fees, further signal a favorable environment for mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs that could significantly boost Goldman's revenue.

          <p>For the first time in four years, the federal government is proposing to resume processing initial applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The plan, submitted by the Justice Department in an ongoing court case, would reopen the program to new applicants in all states except Texas. Under the proposal, Texas residents with DACA could maintain their protection from deportation but would no longer be eligible for work permits, a distinction that has caused confusion and concern among immigrant advocacy groups.</p>

The 161-page decision condemned the actions as a "truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech" and a threat to American freedoms.</p>
