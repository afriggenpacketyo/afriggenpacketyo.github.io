          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is set to host its annual gala, showcasing the exhibition ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù a project five years in the making that focuses on the way Black men have used fashion as a tool of self-actualization, revolution and subversion throughout American history and the Black diaspora. The event takes place amidst increased scrutiny of race and diversity initiatives, particularly in cultural institutions, with some seeing the Met as a symbol of resistance against anti-D.E.I. policies. The gala is expected to feature more Black designers, stylists, and celebrities than ever before, marking a significant moment for Black representation in fashion. Anna Wintour emphasizes the show's focus on self-determination and creativity, while acknowledging its heightened meaning in the current political climate, as the show focuses on the history of Black Dandyism.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop following Warren Buffett's surprising announcement to step down as CEO, ending his 60-year tenure, with Greg Abel slated to take over on January 1, 2026. Class A shares fell nearly 5%, and Class B shares also declined after reaching record highs. Despite the drop, shareholders expressed confidence in the transition, noting Buffett's continued role as chairman, which means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs. Buffett's departure marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under his leadership.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced his plan to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the company's annual meeting, surprising investors, his board, and heir apparent Greg Abel. The move marks the end of an era for the 95-year-old business icon, who has been described as the conscience of capitalism, and the announcement triggered tears and a standing ovation from the audience. While Abel is expected to continue Berkshire's operations, the big question is what will happen to Buffett's masterpiece once it passes to Mr. Abel, as the company was built on the vision of one man, and the investment world won‚Äôt be quite the same.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005 following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, aimed to standardize state ID requirements and enhance security features for federal purposes, including air travel. However, the implementation deadline has been repeatedly extended due to various concerns, including privacy, civil liberties, and practical challenges. Critics, such as Shenna Bellows, initially opposed the act due to fears of a national ID card and potential for identity theft. Despite these concerns, the current deadline is May 7, 2025, with the possibility of phased enforcement, and many states have worked to address initial privacy and security issues.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is meeting this week to review monetary policy and interest rates, which could influence the borrowing and saving climate. While a rate cut in May is unlikely, any hints from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about a potential cut in June could lead to a slight decline in mortgage rates. Borrowers should monitor rates daily for opportunities, and buyers should ensure their credit profiles are strong and shop for the best rates. The article analyzes the potential impact of the Fed's decisions on mortgage rates, suggesting that a rate cut is more likely in June but emphasizing the importance of proactive monitoring.</p>
