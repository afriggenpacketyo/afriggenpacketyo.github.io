          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deploy National Guard troops to Oregon, stating that conditions in Portland did not warrant federal intervention. Judge Immergut found the President's claims about Portland to be unsupported by facts and prohibited the deployment of National Guard from any state. This decision came after the administration attempted to circumvent an earlier order by seeking National Guard support from Texas, which the judge deemed a direct contravention of the initial ruling. The ruling highlights tensions between the federal government and state authorities regarding the use of military force in response to civil unrest. This legal challenge underscores the debate over federal power and states' rights in managing domestic security.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a conservative ally of the late Shinzo Abe, is set to become Japan's first female prime minister after winning the Liberal Democratic Party presidency. Takaichi aims to address economic anxieties and boost hope, facing challenges such as a cost-of-living crisis and managing relations with the U.S. Her victory follows the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, leaving the LDP governing as a minority. Analysts anticipate Takaichi will continue Abenomics, focusing on loose monetary policy and fiscal spending, while also taking a hardline stance towards China and revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Her appointment reflects a potential shift in Japan's economic and foreign policies.</p>

          <p>Sarah Mullally has been named the new Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to lead the Church of England. Mullally, a former chief nursing officer, will succeed Justin Welby, who resigned after an abuse scandal, and will become the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide. While King Charles III is the head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior bishop. Mullally's appointment has been met with both support and criticism, particularly from conservative Anglican churches. She has been known to be progressive, championing causes such as allowing blessings for same-sex couples.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high following Sanae Takaichi's election as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. The yen weakened, briefly hitting 150 against the dollar, raising concerns from Japan's finance minister. Takaichi is expected to maintain accommodative monetary policy, potentially leading to a 25-basis-point rate hike by the Bank of Japan by January 2026. Analysts anticipate consumer, defense, and export-sensitive stocks to benefit under Takaichi's government, while finance and real estate stocks could face headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

More than half of the world's new robots were installed in Chinese factories in 2024, filling labor gaps and enhancing productivity. These robots perform tasks such as welding car frames and assembling electronic devices, ensuring China's manufacturing industry remains competitive. Despite the shrinking population, improvements in workforce education and the widespread use of robots are expected to maintain China's manufacturing edge.

          <p>This article discusses why COVID-19 vaccines are not currently included in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and the complexities surrounding compensation for vaccine-related injuries. The VICP, established in the 1980s, provides a no-fault system for compensating individuals injured by certain vaccines. Currently, COVID-19 vaccines fall under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which is more restrictive and has a shorter statute of limitations. Legal experts advocate for adding COVID vaccines to the VICP to ensure fair compensation for those injured, but concerns about backlog and infrastructure need to be addressed. The article sheds light on the challenges and potential solutions for compensating vaccine injuries.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the deployment as appalling and un-American, vowing to fight the move in court.

          <p>Approximately 30 million UK residents who purchased an Apple or Samsung smartphone between 2015 and 2024 may be entitled to a share of a £480 million payout. This is dependent on the success of a case brought by consumer group Which? against US tech giant Qualcomm. Which? accuses Qualcomm of anti-competitive practices, forcing Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential handset components. If successful, the payout would amount to around £17 per affected phone owner, marking a significant win for consumer rights.

          <p>This BBC article explores the concept of a 'swag gap' in relationships, where partners have differing styles or levels of effort in their appearance. While some believe a mismatch in aesthetics can indicate broader lifestyle differences or disrespect, others argue that style is a spectrum and should not dictate relationship success. Experts suggest that trying to change a partner's style can be harmful, and the key to a happy relationship lies in mutual support and acceptance. The article also touches on the broader implications of 'swag gaps' in success, fame, and confidence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is successfully pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to pursue a peace deal with Hamas, reversing Netanyahu's previous stance of negotiating only 'under fire.' Trump unveiled a 20-point plan for ending the war in Gaza, which Hamas has agreed to consider, and demanded Israel halt bombing. This has led to Israel halting offensive operations and dispatching negotiators to Cairo. Trump's leverage stems from Netanyahu's reliance on their alliance for political support, enabling Trump to dictate terms and influence Israeli policy. This is a significant shift in the dynamics between the two leaders.</p>
