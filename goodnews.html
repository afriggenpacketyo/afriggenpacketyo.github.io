          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and TV presenter Lauren Sanchez hosted a lavish, multi-day wedding celebration in Venice, attracting a host of A-list celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom. The extravagant event, estimated to cost between $20 million and $50 million, included a ceremony on the island of San Giorgio for approximately 200 guests. While the festivities were marked by high-profile attendance and opulent details, they also drew protests from various groups in Venice concerned about issues ranging from over-tourism to climate change. Sanchez wore a custom Dolce & Gabbana gown for the ceremony, which was followed by a large party.</p>

          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old mummy. The remains, believed to be of a woman from the pre-Incan Chancay culture, were found just 20 inches below the ground and notably still had a full head of dark brown hair. Archaeologists confirmed the burial is pre-Hispanic and highlighted that such discoveries are not uncommon in Lima, a city built on top of thousands of years of human settlement with over 400 archaeological sites. The find adds to the rich historical tapestry of the region, where the dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains.</p>

          <p>China has launched Yajiang-1, a state-of-the-art AI computing center located at an altitude of 3,600 meters in the Tibetan region. The facility is part of a broader strategy to leverage the area's natural cold, abundant solar power, and potential for waste heat recovery to create a frontier for sustainable supercomputing. Developed in partnership with the local government, the center aims to drive innovation in fields such as AI training, autonomous driving, and ecosystem monitoring. This initiative represents a significant step in developing high-altitude digital economies and advancing China's technological capabilities in challenging environments.</p>

          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights, including activists from over 30 countries and dozens of European Parliament members, are expected to participate in the Budapest Pride march despite a police ban. The prohibition was enacted under a controversial "child-protection" law from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which restricts exposing minors to non-heterosexual content. The event has evolved into a symbol of resistance against the broader repression of civil liberties in Hungary. Over 30 foreign embassies and the European Commission have voiced their support for the march, urging Hungarian authorities to allow the peaceful demonstration to proceed.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder marked his return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon in a subdued event in Kansas. This was Wilder's first win since October 2022, following a difficult period with three losses in his previous four fights. The 39-year-old, known as the "Bronze Bomber," displayed a more measured approach, using his jab effectively before securing the win, a contrast to his typically explosive, power-punching style. While the victory puts him back in the win column, Wilder acknowledged it was a "new beginning" as he aims to rebuild his career and potentially secure future high-profile fights.</p>

This generation is already a significant economic force, with their spending expected to reach trillions of dollars by 2029. Louise Hill, founder of GoHenry, suggests using tangible methods like giving physical pocket money to help children understand that money must be earned before it's spent. For older children, she recommends "pizza budgeting"‚Äîa visual exercise to show how household income is divided among necessities, which helps them grasp the concept of budgeting and responsible spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading economist from China International Capital Corporation, Peng Wensheng, has suggested that China's mature third-party payment systems, such as WeChat and Alipay, provide the nation with a "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. In a research note, Peng argued that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operate under a well-established regulatory framework. He highlighted that the stability of these platforms is secured by customer funds being backed by central bank money, suggesting China is well-positioned as stablecoins become more prominent in global finance.

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) that is implanted through blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique helped a 67-year-old paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. Unlike the surgical approach used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, this interventional method involves inserting a stent electrode into an intracranial blood vessel via a vein in the neck. The innovation promises to reduce surgical risks and shorten patient recovery times, marking a significant advancement in neurotechnology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed a 5-4 victory against the Kansas City Royals, extending their winning streak despite what their manager called an incomplete performance. The game featured a leadoff home run from Shohei Ohtani and a go-ahead RBI single from Mookie Betts, but was also marked by a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May and costly defensive errors. The Dodgers' bullpen held off a late rally, with the game ending on a bases-loaded double play in the ninth inning. While the team now holds the best record in the majors, the sloppy win highlights a recent trend of grinding out victories without playing their best baseball.</p>
