          <p>The Trump administration is promoting a series of recent successes, framing them as a major wave of momentum. Key achievements cited include the passage of a $3.3 trillion tax and domestic policy bill, which makes 2017 tax cuts permanent and institutes new spending on defense and immigration enforcement. Other highlighted victories are successful U.S. military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, and a $16 million legal settlement from Paramount Global. The White House has characterized this period as one of historic accomplishment for the American people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mortality rate from heart attacks has plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. between 1970 and 2022, marking a significant public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including successful anti-smoking campaigns, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and advancements in emergency medical care like CPR and portable defibrillators. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with rising rates of obesity and diabetes posing new challenges. The article suggests that wider adoption of new drugs like Ozempic and advanced screenings could further reduce its toll.</p>

          <h2>China and EU Reportedly Nearing Agreement on Electric Vehicle Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 08:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Chinese state-affiliated media, China and the European Union have nearly completed the technical negotiations required to resolve their dispute over electric vehicle (EV) tariffs. The report suggests that the main outstanding element is the political will from the EU to finalize the agreement. This development comes after a period of trade friction, with the EU launching multiple investigations into Chinese trade practices, including subsidies and alleged market-distorting actions. A resolution would mark a significant de-escalation in the ongoing economic tensions between the two global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against an understrength Waratahs side, though the performance was marked by numerous errors and a lack of accuracy. Huw Jones was a standout player, scoring two tries in the first half to give the tourists an early lead. Despite their struggles with handling errors and discipline, a third try from Alex Mitchell secured the win. The match highlighted areas for improvement for the Lions as they continue their tour in Australia, with the crucial Test series against the Wallabies just two weeks away.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Florida residents, environmental groups, and businesses has successfully lobbied for a new law banning oil and gas exploration near the Apalachicola River. The effort, known as "Kill the Drill," was spurred by a state-approved permit for exploratory drilling, which evoked memories of the economic devastation caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill threat. State lawmakers authored and passed House Bill 1143, which Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law, creating a permanent ban in the ecologically sensitive area. This victory is being hailed as a crucial step in protecting the region's environment and economy.</p>

These rewards systems have become essential tools for driving repeat business, as data shows that loyalty members visit restaurants more frequently than non-members. In response to slowing sales, brands are revamping their programs to offer more value and flexibility, aiming to build long-term customer habits that extend beyond simple discounts. The strategy is critical for navigating a challenging industry environment where diners are making more intentional spending choices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new Apple TV+ series "Murderbot" subverts typical AI narratives by featuring a security cyborg that achieves free will but has no interest in humanity. Based on a novella by Martha Wells, the show follows the titular character, played by Alexander Skarsgård, who hacks its own governing module and would rather spend its time watching soap operas than interacting with the humans it protects. This premise offers a refreshing departure from common sci-fi tropes where artificial beings seek to become more human. Instead, the series explores the idea that a truly independent AI might find human emotions and society unrelatable and undesirable.</p>

          <p>Eight key oil-producing nations within the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase their collective crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This move, which is larger than the initially anticipated 411,000 barrels, continues the group's strategy of gradually unwinding voluntary production cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories. This acceleration of production hikes by major players like Saudi Arabia and Russia signals a response to current market conditions, including recent price boosts from seasonal demand and geopolitical tensions.

The article follows a "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., highlighting Barber's fusion organizing strategy, which unites diverse groups to create a moral force for political change.

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may help fight cancer. The research indicates that the drug can strengthen a key group of anti-tumor immune cells known as dendritic cells. These cells, which act as intelligence agents for the immune system, can become depleted or impaired as a tumor progresses. According to the findings published in the journal Nature, sildenafil appears to reverse this process, potentially offering a new form of tumor immunotherapy strategy by restoring the function of these vital cells.</p>

An actor and community activist organized a social media campaign to buy out the boy's entire stock, drawing a large crowd and raising over $1,500 for the family.
