        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging over 40%. This growth is attributed to its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news like the Senate's GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the market may not have fully priced in Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining crypto trading volumes, the overall sentiment is bullish, with many seeing Coinbase as a key way to invest in the growing utility of the crypto sector.

          <p>A 23-year-old man was arrested in Huntington Park, California, on suspicion of impersonating a federal immigration agent. Police discovered the man's vehicle, a Dodge Durango, equipped with police lights and radios, and found a list of U.S. Customs and Border Protection radio codes inside. The suspect was also carrying an unlicensed handgun. This arrest highlights growing community concerns about the potential for criminal impersonation, especially as real federal agents have been seen conducting raids in unmarked clothing and masks, prompting calls for new legislation requiring clear identification for officers.</p>

          <p>Honduran experimental pop artist Isabella Lovestory is releasing her second album, "Vanity," which draws inspiration from folklore, mid-2000s club music, and Old Hollywood glamour. In an interview, the artist, born Isabella Rodr√≠guez Rivera, described her music as a post-genre blend of electroclash and reggaeton that explores themes of beauty, self-image, and vulnerability. As a self-sustaining artist who handles everything from her album art to video direction, she embraces a "scrappy as hell" punk ethos. She views her public persona as a form of performance art, projecting a complex inner world.</p>

          <p>Tensions and speculation are rising in the Formula 1 paddock following comments from Mercedes driver George Russell acknowledging that his team is in talks with Red Bull's Max Verstappen. With Russell's contract ending this season, a potential move by Verstappen to Mercedes in 2026 could reshape the driver market. Verstappen is reportedly weighing his options due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and questions about its new engine program for 2026. However, a Verstappen-Mercedes pairing would involve significant hurdles, including salary, brand image, and the volatile dynamic of pairing him with a driver like Russell.</p>

After the boy fell 24 feet and was knocked unconscious, the 8-year-old gorilla gently picked him up, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. The event garnered international praise, with many attributing her actions to maternal instinct, especially as she had her own baby on her back. Binti Jua, now 37, became a celebrated hero and still resides at the Chicago-area zoo today.</p>
