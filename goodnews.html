          <p>The UK government proposed expanding its ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, to a larger area of English waters.  This expansion aims to protect vulnerable marine habitats and species within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The proposal follows concerns raised by Sir David Attenborough and calls from MPs to protect the ocean floor.  A 12-week consultation with the fishing industry will precede the implementation of the expanded ban.</p>
