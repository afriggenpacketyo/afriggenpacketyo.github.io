          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the U.S. despite a federal court decision that overturned many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The UK aims to finalize deals covering sectors such as cars, metals, and airplane parts, with negotiators having spent the previous week in Washington discussing implementation. This decision comes even as a court ruling against Trump's tariffs is temporarily paused pending further review. The UK government believes the deals are crucial for protecting British businesses and jobs, and are striving for swift implementation. The optimism score reflects the potential economic benefits of the trade deals.</p>
