        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government is considering eliminating the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Phillipson acknowledged that while removing the cap would be costly, it has pushed many families into poverty and has scarred the life chances of children in the country. The government is expected to announce its decision on the cap in the autumn, following a review by the Child Poverty Taskforce, with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table" and a Labour government would never have introduced such a cap.</p>

He addresses concerns about antisemitism and political viewpoint diversity on campus, emphasizing the importance of free speech and civil discourse.
