        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2, largely due to a stellar performance by pitcher Garrett Crochet who effectively shut down the Dodgers' offense. While the Dodgers managed two early solo home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, Crochet consistently worked out of jams, striking out ten batters. In contrast, Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw struggled with his command, allowing four runs in less than five innings. The loss highlighted the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities against the Red Sox ace.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as a new profession, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This emerging sector, which includes activities up to 1,000 meters, is being treated as a strategic industry by Beijing to drive innovation and economic growth. The new role involves planning multi-drone flight paths, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. The designation is part of a broader effort to formalize jobs in new economic fields.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge is heading to the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The news comes as a relief to the team and its fans, as a more serious injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the majors in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. He first felt the pain after making a strong throw from the outfield in a game earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering him not just as a music legend, but as an early 2000s reality television icon. His family's MTV show, "The Osbournes," pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, offering an unfiltered look at their domestic life in Beverly Hills. The show's blend of mundane family frustrations with a rock-and-roll lifestyle made it a massive success, paving the way for future celebrity-driven reality TV. It portrayed the "Prince of Darkness" as a lovable, if often confused, father figure.</p>

          <p>For fans experiencing intense physical and emotional reactions during high-stakes football matches like the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the hormonal science behind the stress. The body's fight-or-flight response, driven by adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate and a buzzy feeling. Experts advise managing these effects by getting good rest, having a clear match day plan, and engaging in movement to release energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the anxiety as part of the enjoyable, communal experience of supporting a team.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of the state. Forecasters warn that summer isn't over, as the city's hottest days often occur in September.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to offer greater protection to pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly those from residents of new property developments. Under the proposed changes, developers would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings constructed near existing venues. The government hopes these reforms will bring vibrancy back to town centers, make it easier to open new bars in disused shops, and promote outdoor hospitality. The move comes after several beloved venues faced closure threats due to noise-related legal battles. (not investment advice)</p>
