          <p>A federal judge has issued an order preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook while her lawsuit is ongoing. The ruling emphasizes the public interest in maintaining the independence of the Federal Reserve. Trump had attempted to remove Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This event marks the first time a U.S. president has attempted to fire a member of the Fed Board, highlighting significant tensions between the administration and the central bank.</p>

In an interview, Sheen reflected on his firing from "Two and a Half Men" and his path to sobriety, which he has now maintained for nearly eight years. He explained that he chose to stop because the lifestyle had lost its appeal and he felt he was letting down himself and his family.</p>

          <p>Michael James Pratt, the owner of the notorious "GirlsDoPorn" website, has been sentenced to 27 years in federal prison for sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion. During the sentencing, forty women testified about how Pratt and his accomplices lured them with fake modeling ads and then coerced them into performing sex acts on camera. The victims, many of whom were between 18 and 21, shared stories of the long-lasting trauma caused by the non-consensual distribution of the videos. Pratt, once on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, admitted to his role in the scheme.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement that sets the stage for resuming cooperation and inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, is being called "a step in the right direction" by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. This development comes at a critical time, as European nations have threatened to reimpose UN sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran suspended cooperation with IAEA inspectors in July following attacks on its nuclear sites.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, should jointly host the 2036 Summer Olympics. The author contends that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would mitigate the high costs and economic burdens often associated with hosting the Games. By leveraging infrastructure already in place, the Greater Bay Area could present a cost-effective and sustainable model for the Olympics. The article highlights the area's unique position to meet and exceed logistical requirements for athletes and events.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered an impressive performance in a rehab start for Triple-A Oklahoma City, pitching four shutout innings and reaching speeds over 100 mph. This strong outing has put him back in consideration for a spot on the Dodgers' postseason roster, potentially as a bullpen arm. Sasaki had been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since mid-May and struggled in his initial rehab appearances. His potential return adds another valuable option for the team as they prepare for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide on the legality of President Donald Trump's extensive tariffs, which were implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Lower courts had ruled that the president exceeded his authority by using the emergency law to impose the duties, a decision the Justice Department appealed. The case, brought by small businesses and several states, represents a major test of presidential power and a core component of Trump's economic agenda. Arguments are scheduled for November, setting the stage for a significant showdown over executive authority in trade policy.</p>

          <p>A new blood test for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK in a study that researchers hope will revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test, which detects key protein biomarkers associated with the disease, is expected to improve diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90%. Previously, definitive diagnosis required invasive procedures like lumbar punctures or expensive PET scans, which are rarely used. If successful, this more accessible and affordable test could enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial for the effectiveness of emerging treatments.</p>

The expansion is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via a simple tap. The plan would allow individual banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing use of contactless technology, it has raised some consumer concerns about fraud. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value payments for low-risk transactions.</p>
