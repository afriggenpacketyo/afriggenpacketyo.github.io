          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom are set to sign a comprehensive trade deal, making the U.K. the first country to do so after the U.S. announced tariffs against various nations. President Trump announced the agreement on Truth Social, highlighting the long-standing relationship between the two countries. The U.K.'s central bank had previously cut interest rates, citing global growth concerns due to tariff uncertainty, but noted the impact on the U.K. would be smaller. The New York Times first reported the impending announcement, signaling a significant economic and diplomatic development.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that new trade agreements could be announced this week, as his administration faces pressure to finalize deals before a pause on tariffs ends in July. The U.S. is in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects to have most deals wrapped up by the end of the year. The U.S. has not yet entered active trade talks with China, although Bessent is set to meet with a Chinese delegation in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger role in American children's lives due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancy, and the rising cost of childcare. They provide various benefits, including better educational and mental health outcomes, and often step in to fill gaps in childcare. However, experts caution against solely relying on grandparents to solve childcare challenges, emphasizing the need for affordable and accessible childcare options. Grandparents can also offer a unique perspective and create a stronger intergenerational connection, enriching children's lives.</p>
