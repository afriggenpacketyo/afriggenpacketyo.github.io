          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the importance of regulating the exercise of power as a crucial step in combating corruption. Speaking at an education campaign for officials, he called for improved institutional mechanisms to make the use of power transparent and traceable, reminding cadres that all authority is granted by the people. The campaign focuses on implementing Xi's austerity rules to improve the party's conduct, which Beijing considers vital for its public image and legitimacy.</p>

However, critics, including the Tax Foundation and Morgan Stanley, express serious concerns about the bill's projected $3 trillion addition to the federal deficit and its potential impact on long-term fiscal sustainability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The question of how much to save for retirement lacks a single answer, as individual needs vary from modest living to extensive travel. A report by Hargreaves Lansdown examined different adequacy measures, including benchmarks from the Living Wage Foundation and the Pension and Lifetime Saving Association. The analysis found that fixed-income "pounds and pence" measures might not be suitable for higher earners, while relative measures based on pre-retirement income can be more effective. The UK government is expected to address this complexity in its upcoming Pension Review. (not investment advice)</p>

While largely symbolic, the presidency comes during a period of significant global geopolitical tension. Pakistan's UN Ambassador stated the country would work cooperatively to promote peaceful conflict resolution. The move is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over Kashmir, while India is reportedly preparing a counter-strategy focusing on its economic strength and cross-border terrorism.</p>

This trend is attributed to a more resilient-than-feared Chinese economy and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt, which is expected to weaken the dollar. The People's Bank of China has been setting a stronger daily reference rate for its currency. Goldman Sachs projects the yuan could break the 7 per dollar mark within six months and reach 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the report also highlighted challenges, including a third consecutive monthly decline in new export orders and cautious hiring among businesses.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed significant housing reform legislation through the California Legislature, aimed at speeding up construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. To ensure passage despite opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor groups, Newsom tied the legislation to the state budget with a "poison pill" provision.

The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 Guard members from their controversial deployment, which was ordered by the Trump administration to handle immigration-related protests. This potential shift comes after California officials warned that the federal deployment was straining resources needed for firefighting.
