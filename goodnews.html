          <p>A zoo on the Isle of Wight is celebrating the birth of two red panda cubs, a significant event for the endangered species. The twins were born on June 17 to parents Xiao and Flint, who were paired as part of a breeding program earlier in 2024. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the red panda population is in decline due to threats like poaching and habitat loss from forest clearance. The zoo is closely monitoring the cubs, which will remain in their nest box for about three months, expressing cautious optimism for their survival and the program's success.</p>

          <h2>Minnesota to Mandate Mental Health Warning Labels on Social Media Platforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota has become the first U.S. state to enact a law requiring social media platforms to display mental health warning labels to users. Starting in July 2026, users will see a pop-up message acknowledging that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health before they can access the sites. The law, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Zack Stephenson, aims to encourage more mindful online behavior, particularly among young people, and draws parallels to warnings on tobacco and alcohol. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the measure, arguing it compels private companies to spread the state's message, and has indicated it may pursue legal action to block its enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Suggest Tailored Approaches for Children with Strong Cravings for Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists and scientists are highlighting that some children possess a naturally stronger 'food reward drive,' making them more susceptible to overconsuming ultra-processed foods. These children often feel hungrier, eat faster, and struggle with satiety signals, which can lead to health issues in an environment where such foods are prevalent. Experts advise parents of these children to adopt specific strategies, such as limiting the variety of ultra-processed items in the home rather than trying to regulate portion sizes. They recommend creating a home environment based on whole or minimally processed foods while allowing for occasional consumption of ultra-processed items in social settings to foster a healthy, balanced relationship with food.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba has announced its entry into the smart glasses market with the upcoming launch of its Quark AI Glasses. Set to be released in China by the end of 2025, the device will be powered by the company's Qwen large language model and its Quark AI assistant. The move positions Alibaba as a direct competitor to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and offerings from other Chinese firms like Xiaomi. The glasses will feature capabilities such as hands-free calling, real-time translation, and integration with Alibaba's ecosystem, including its Taobao e-commerce platform and Alipay payment service, marking a significant step into wearable hardware for the company.</p>

          <p>England has called up all-rounder Jamie Overton to its cricket squad for the decisive fifth and final Test match against India at The Oval. The move is intended to provide cover and reinforce the pace attack, which was significantly taxed during the drawn fourth Test in Manchester. Key bowlers like Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse have played in all four matches of the series, prompting Captain Ben Stokes to mention the potential need for 'fresh legs.' With a tight turnaround before the final match begins on Thursday, Overton joins Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue as available pace options for an England side needing to avoid defeat to win the series.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact while preparing for an exhibition. The print was found on the underside of a 'soul house,' a clay model of a building placed in tombs for the deceased's spirit, dating from 2055 to 1650 BC. Curators believe the handprint was left by the maker who moved the object to dry before it was fired in a kiln. The Fitzwilliam Museum described the find as 'rare and exciting,' offering a direct, personal connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history, unlike the famous rulers they served.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework deal on trade, establishing a new 15% tariff on many European exports to the US, including cars. This agreement averts the previously threatened 30% rate but is a significant climbdown for the EU, as it is higher than historical levels and the UK's 10% rate. In return, the EU will reportedly open its markets to American exports at zero tariff and has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in US energy and arms. President Trump has hailed the deal as a major victory, with the US expecting to gain roughly $90 billion in annual tariff revenue. (not investment advice)</p>
