          <p>Five current or former Iowa State football coaching staff members have faced NCAA penalties for violating sports wagering rules, including placing bets on the school's basketball programs. The coaches made over 6,200 online bets totaling more than $100,000 on various sporting events. The violations are classified as Level II, and the coaches face show-cause orders and suspensions. The investigation stemmed from a state inquiry into sports wagering activities on campus, leading to charges against dozens of athletes for underage gambling and identity theft.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has largely recovered from the sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements in early April, with stocks buoyed by hopes for renewed trade talks with China. The S&P 500 has rebounded, erasing losses from the period following Trump's tariff implementation. However, the market remains sensitive to trade policy developments, and questions linger about the long-term impact of tariffs on economic growth. Despite recent gains, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and analysts caution that the damage to economic momentum may already be done. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment (NCA) report, two US scientific associations are soliciting research to fill the gap. The American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) aim to "sustain the momentum" of the next report, which is due in 2027. The NCA is a comprehensive report on the impacts of climate change in the United States, providing crucial information for decision-making and future projections. Experts emphasize the importance of the report for addressing climate change impacts and planning for the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu, the online retailer known for ultra-discounted goods shipped directly from China, has ceased direct shipments to the U.S. due to the expiration of the de minimis tariff loophole. President Trump signed an executive order to end the loophole, which allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free. Temu has shifted to displaying only products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses and is recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, though some customers were being charged import fees of up to 150% on goods shipped directly from China.</p>

          <p>The article examines the complex relationship between President Trump and Fox News, describing it as a "love-hate" dynamic driven by mutual need. Despite Trump's occasional criticism of the network, Fox News serves as a key platform for the administration to communicate its message and gain the president's attention. The relationship is described as a marriage of convenience, where emotions are secondary to the utility each party provides to the other. The White House's attempt to circumvent traditional media with its own platform still relies heavily on content from Fox News.</p>
