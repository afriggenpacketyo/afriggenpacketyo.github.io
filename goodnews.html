          <h2>Weight Loss Drugs Show Promise as Potential Treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:32:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women using these medications have reported significant improvements, including weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps regulate hormones, addressing a key metabolic issue linked to PCOS. While larger clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits and address issues like insurance coverage, the initial results offer hope for a new therapeutic approach to the common hormonal disorder.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has undergone a significant leadership change within its advanced technology research group, which focuses on emerging fields like quantum computing. Marco Pistoia, who led the group since 2020, has departed the bank along with his top deputy for quantum communications. To fill the role, JPMorgan has hired Rob Otter from State Street, where he served as the global head of digital technology and quantum computing. This executive overhaul signals a strategic shift for the financial giant as it continues to explore the potential applications of quantum technology in solving complex financial problems.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to attract budget-conscious consumers as the restaurant industry grapples with diners cutting back on spending. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, attributing the growth to successful promotions like its stuffed crust pizza and value-oriented deals. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while the industry faces headwinds, Domino's sees an opportunity to gain market share by offering deals on popular items, unlike competitors who may discount less desirable products. The strategy appears to be working, as the chain saw sales growth across all income levels, including lower-income households.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become a leading public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike other firms that simply hold cryptocurrency, this company will differentiate itself by actively staking its ether holdings to generate yield, a process analogous to earning dividends. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as the Ethereum network can support a wide range of tokenized assets beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions. The move reflects growing institutional interest in ether, especially following recent regulatory clarity in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing public health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Scientific research suggests that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Effective, evidence-based methods include reducing notifications, setting the screen to black-and-white, keeping the phone out of the bedroom, and using self-control apps. For severe cases, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction, which often stem from using the phone as an escape from stress or other mental health challenges.</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has purchased approximately $2 billion worth of bitcoin and related securities. The move is part of a new corporate strategy to build a cryptocurrency reserve, similar to the approach popularized by Michael Saylor's company, Strategy. CEO Devin Nunes stated the bitcoin treasury will help ensure the company's financial freedom and protect it from potential discrimination by traditional financial institutions. This investment aligns with former President Trump's increasing focus on digital assets, both in his private business and through his administration's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

In his first court appearance in Brooklyn, he pleaded not guilty to all seven counts. His extradition, the first of its kind directly from Ecuador to the U.S., marks a significant moment in the country's fight against the transnational crime syndicates that have fueled a surge in violence.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff who identify passengers with oversized baggage. Employees currently receive a small fee for intercepting non-compliant bags, a practice O'Leary says is aimed at eliminating boarding delays and ensuring fairness for the vast majority of passengers who follow the rules. The airline charges significant fees for oversized luggage, and O'Leary stated he is happy to incentivize staff with a share of those fees. This comes as the airline reported a substantial increase in profits for the first quarter of its fiscal year.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has recommended that YouTube should give more prominence to content from public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC and ITV. The watchdog warned that the future of public service media is at risk because young audiences spend significantly more time on YouTube and are not engaging with traditional PSB content. Ofcom's report suggests broadcasters must work with YouTube to make their material easier to find and is urging the government to consider legislation to enforce this. The goal is to ensure that trusted news and British cultural programming remain visible in a digital-first landscape.</p>

Gergiev has been largely barred from Western stages since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which he has refused to condemn. The cancellation was praised by Kremlin critics, including Yulia Navalnaya, and described as "common sense" by Italy's Culture Minister. A Russian ambassador to Italy, however, called the decision a "scandalous situation" and part of a policy of 'canceling' Russian culture, highlighting ongoing geopolitical tensions in the arts world.</p>
