          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Rachel Feintzeig explores her obsession with zombie shows like "The Last of Us," despite the anxiety and dread they induce. She argues that these fictional horrors serve as a distraction from real-world anxieties, providing a temporary escape from the kind-of-sort-of-possibly apocalyptic things happening in 2025. The author recounts how horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage, offering a sense of perspective by focusing on someone else's troubles. Ultimately, she acknowledges the relief of the season ending, while also wondering what new terrifying alternate reality she will escape to now that the show is over. The author finds that the only thing worse than suffering through a fantasy apocalypse is having to find a new one.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with some expressing a preference for a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are not allowed, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies show that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire a "digital curfew." Some countries are considering political measures to protect young people from the harmful effects of excessive smartphone use, such as mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media usage.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching is anticipated after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters in a simulated game for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers initially considered having him return to the mound early in the season, but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training, while slowing down his pitching rehab. Ohtani recently threw all his pitches in practice, including a slider, which he had previously avoided due to the burden on his elbow.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has reopened after being closed due to the Palisades Fire, just in time for Memorial Day weekend. The closure inadvertently isolated Malibu, but the reopening signals progress in the area's recovery from the fire that killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres. While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful that the reopening will bring much-needed customers and revitalize the community. The Army Corps of Engineers has cleared over 60% of lots of debris, but reminders of the devastation remain visible along PCH.</p>

During the trial, Michelle was attacked by the defense, who portrayed her as irresponsible and potentially complicit. Despite the overwhelming evidence against the actual perpetrators, the ordeal took a significant toll on Michelle and Breea, but they eventually found healing through sharing their story and advocating for victims of trauma.</p>

The study concludes that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of their canine companions.</p>

The footage released by China South Industries Group has garnered attention from military experts, as this firing capacity outstrips current weaponry. The breakthrough involves eliminating capacitors and powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This advancement overcomes the limitations of earlier prototypes and commercial models, which were hindered by the recharging lag time associated with capacitors.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with responsibility transferring to the Department for Transport Operator and integration into Great British Railways (GBR). The government is focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, while Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the nationalization of SWR as a "real watershed moment", although she could not promise lower fares.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. These commitments come as Prime Minister Starmer faces pressure from within the Labour party to address these issues. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioners, while the two-child benefit cap restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

          <h2>Japan to Increase Salaries for Chefs at Diplomatic Missions Amid Growing Culinary Popularity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 20:41:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to intensifying competition for talent as the nation's cuisine grows in popularity worldwide. The new scheme, slated to start in January, will increase annual salaries to over 6 million yen and allow chefs to opt for government-covered rented accommodation. The Foreign Minister hopes this will enable chefs to more proactively promote Japanese food as "food diplomats". The changes are expected to enable the chefs to draw their career paths more easily.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, with visitors cringing and expressing concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges do not bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights.</p>

          <h2>New York City Beaches Open with Lifeguard Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 20:23:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's public beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, falling short of the required staffing levels. However, this number is higher than last year's Memorial Day weekend. City officials are hopeful that staffing will increase as students finish classes and summer arrives, with 374 new lifeguards currently in training. The city has implemented incentives like increased wages and signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards, while also improving lifeguard stations. The article highlights the importance of beach safety and the need for vigilance, even with lifeguards present.</p>
