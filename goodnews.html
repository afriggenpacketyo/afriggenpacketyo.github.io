          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television host Matt Tebbutt will join the judging panel for the upcoming series of 'MasterChef: The Professionals,' replacing Gregg Wallace. Tebbutt, known for hosting 'Saturday Kitchen,' will work alongside established judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. His appointment follows Wallace's dismissal in July after an inquiry upheld 45 allegations regarding his behavior, including inappropriate conduct and offensive language. The controversy also led to the dismissal of co-host John Torode from the main series, with the BBC yet to announce their permanent replacements for that program.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese space researcher, Wu Weiren, has revealed that the country is planning a mission to test its planetary defense capabilities against potential asteroid threats. The mission aims to demonstrate a "kinetic impact" by sending an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters, with an observer craft monitoring the results. According to Wu, who is the chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, the nation is striving to carry out this ambitious test within the current year to advance its deep-space exploration and planetary defense technologies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural phenomenon 'Hamilton' is being re-examined as the filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. The article explores how the musical's perception has shifted from its initial alignment with the optimism of the Obama era to its current context in a more polarized America. Initially celebrated as a progressive retelling of the nation's founding, the show later faced criticism for glossing over the founders' connections to slavery. Experts now suggest that the musical, once seen as a celebration of the American dream, feels more like a tragedy about how quickly political ideals can fracture.</p>

          <p>The 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-Black National Guard unit known as the Harlem Hellfighters, has been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their distinguished service in World War I. Despite their battlefield heroism and spending 191 days in combat, the unit faced intense racism and was largely ignored by the U.S. military establishment of their time. The ceremony, attended by descendants of the soldiers, acknowledged the injustice of denying them full freedoms at home while they fought for them abroad. The medal will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution, highlighting a complex moment of historical recognition amid ongoing debates about American history.</p>

          <h2>Rise of Weight-Loss Drugs Poised to Reshape Consumer Habits and the Snack Food Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is beginning to alter consumer spending, posing a challenge to the snack and processed food industries. Recent studies show that within six months, users of these drugs reduce their grocery spending and shift away from ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks toward healthier options. While indulgence is unlikely to disappear, this trend is forcing retailers and food companies to adapt their strategies, such as by reformulating products with higher protein content. This consumer shift could become a significant battleground for food companies, particularly during events like football season, which are traditionally associated with high-calorie snacking.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has taken a roughly 10% stake in Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder in a strategic move to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This action, converting previous grants under the CHIPS Act into equity, aims to reduce reliance on foreign chipmakers like Taiwan's TSMC, especially amid geopolitical tensions with China. While government intervention in private companies is rare in the U.S., this step is seen as crucial for national security and maintaining a competitive edge in AI technology. The investment seeks to help Intel catch up with global competitors and secure the supply chain for critical technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status brings renewed focus to Japan's male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a demographic crisis. This has intensified debate over whether the law should be changed to allow women, such as the emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne, a move supported by much of the public but opposed by conservatives.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author recounts how they, a person with no prior interest in sports, became a devoted Buffalo Bills fan through their relationship with a Buffalonian. The article explores how the team embodies the spirit of the city of Buffalo itself: resilient, hardworking, and perpetually on the cusp of greatness but often falling short. This underdog narrative, from the four consecutive Super Bowl losses in the 90s to recent playoff heartbreaks, has forged an intensely loyal and positive community. The author reflects on how this shared allegiance creates a sense of home and connection that transcends geography.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new, long-term incentive package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The plan, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if he meets a series of extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The board stated the package is designed to retain Musk, who has reportedly threatened to leave, and to incentivize him to lead Tesla's transformation into an AI and robotics leader.

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita created one of football's most unforgettable moments with his "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. Known for his eccentric and high-risk style of play, "El Loco" chose to clear a misplaced shot by theatrically diving forward and kicking the ball away with his heels over his back. The article reflects on the audacity of the move and the unique career of Higuita, who was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, a prolific goalscorer, and a controversial figure off the pitch, forever cementing his legacy with that single, acrobatic save.</p>

          <p>A 14-year-old boy named Elias from Staffordshire is set to begin his studies in biomedical engineering at Imperial College London this fall after achieving four A*s and an A in his A-level exams. Elias, who has been homeschooled since the pandemic, was tutored by his older sisters, who are also students at Imperial. His 11-year-old sister, Ariel, is also excelling academically, having earned top grades in her GCSEs at an early age. The family attributes their success to a balanced and supportive home-learning environment, and the older siblings hope to inspire other talented students by offering tutoring services.</p>
