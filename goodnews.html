          <p>The U.S. Open semifinals will feature a compelling match between Naomi Osaka and Amanda Anisimova, both of whom have recently returned to top-tier tennis after taking breaks to focus on their mental health. Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, is competing in her first major semifinal since becoming a mother, while Anisimova has made a remarkable comeback after citing burnout. Their journeys back to the top of the sport have been challenging, and their success is seen as a significant moment for the ongoing conversation about mental wellness in professional athletics. The winner will advance to the U.S. Open final.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial choice for retirees, with significant implications for their monthly income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, doing so results in a permanently reduced payment. Waiting until the full retirement age, typically 66 or 67, provides the standard benefit amount. However, delaying claims until age 70 can increase monthly payments by approximately 8% for each year of deferral, maximizing the guaranteed income stream for life. The article suggests that the best age depends on individual circumstances, including health, financial need, and other retirement income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea has agreed to a club-record deal, valued at just under £1 million, to sign 20-year-old forward Alyssa Thompson from the NWSL club Angel City. The United States international is considered one of the world's most promising young talents and is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Women's Super League club. The transfer surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma but falls short of the WSL's overall record. Thompson's arrival is a timely boost for Chelsea's attack, which has recently been affected by injuries to key players.</p>

          <h2>Ford Reports Strong Sales Growth for Gas-Powered Expedition SUV Amid EV Rush</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:07:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford's redesigned, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant surge in sales, with an increase of 53.7% in August compared to the previous year, marking its best performance in 21 years. This growth stands out as many consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expires. While Ford's EV sales are also up, the strong performance of the large, internal combustion engine SUV indicates continued market demand for traditional vehicles. The trend supports Ford's strategy of prioritizing hybrid models alongside its EV development, a different approach from some competitors who are more fully committed to an all-electric transition.</p>

          <p>The launch of "Hollow Knight: Silksong," one of the year's most awaited video games, caused widespread technical issues for major digital storefronts like Steam, Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox. Thousands of gamers reported being unable to purchase the title due to overwhelming demand immediately following its release. The sequel to the critically acclaimed 2017 game "Hollow Knight" generated so much traffic that it led to error codes and temporary outages. Despite the purchasing difficulties, Steam data showed that over 100,000 people were playing the game within 30 minutes of its launch, highlighting the massive excitement surrounding its debut.</p>

          <p>After 24 years in charge, Daniel Levy is stepping down from his role as executive chairman of the Tottenham Hotspur football club. His tenure saw the club win the Europa League last season, ending a 17-year trophy drought, and oversee the construction of a state-of-the-art new stadium. However, his leadership also faced criticism from fans, particularly during last season's difficult Premier League campaign, with protests calling for his departure. Peter Charrington, a director of the club's ownership group ENIC, will take on the new role of non-executive chairman, marking a significant leadership change for the prominent English club.</p>

          <h2>New Book Explores the Pervasive Influence of Conjure, a Spiritual Tradition Forged in Slavery, on American Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 12:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep and often unacknowledged influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved Africans, on mainstream American culture. The book argues that traditions from cooking black-eyed peas for New Year's to the thematic elements of blues music have roots in conjure rituals. Stewart traces how Black women, as the primary practitioners of this domestic art, shaped American practices in medicine, food, and spirituality. Amid a recent wave of cultural depictions in films like "Sinners" and shows like "Lovecraft Country," the book highlights the resilience and enduring legacy of this hybrid spiritual system.</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old resident of Miami Gardens, has finally obtained her birth certificate for the first time in her life. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she was never officially registered and lived her entire life without this fundamental document. The lack of a birth certificate became a significant obstacle with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. After a lengthy legal process initiated by her son to prove her existence, and with help from local media coverage, she has now received her official birth certificate and a new Real ID, opening the door to future international travel.</p>
