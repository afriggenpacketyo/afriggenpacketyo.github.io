          <p>This article discusses how George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently embroiled himself in Ohio politics during John Boehner's first congressional race in 1990. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a sexual scandal on national television. Boehner's team responded, accusing Jolivette of cheap politics, and Boehner himself criticized Wendt for his remarks. Despite the gaffe, Boehner won the election and later became Speaker of the House. The article details the incident and Boehner's reaction, reflecting on the intersection of celebrity and politics. The article illustrates how a humorous incident became a memorable part of Boehner's early political career.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to save as many bees as possible and help them re-hive. The road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery operation. The situation was eventually brought under control, with most bees expected to return to their hives by morning.</p>

The author notes that this adaptability reassures swing voters, suggesting that anything extreme is provisional.
