          <h2>UK Saltmarshes Play a Crucial Role in Climate Change Mitigation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 02:10:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, act as natural carbon sinks by capturing carbon dioxide in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. By formally recognizing their importance, the WWF hopes to incentivize the restoration and protection of saltmarsh ecosystems, emphasizing their significance for climate mitigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated discussions on legislation that would allow married couples to maintain separate surnames, marking the first such debate in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three bills submitted by opposition parties remains uncertain due to resistance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The LDP expresses concerns that the change could undermine family cohesion and traditional values, while a Kyodo News poll indicates that 71% of respondents favor the dual family-name system, highlighting a significant divergence between public opinion and political action.</p>

          <p>This news digest reports that China has agreed to initiate procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Additionally, Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the U.S. in exchange for tariff easing. Core consumer prices in Tokyo have risen at the fastest pace in over two years, while Japan is lifting some sanctions against Syria to aid in rebuilding efforts following the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad.

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing deals with multinational corporations, driven by the need for cost savings. These deals often utilize a newco structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. The trend reflects a shift towards licensing intellectual property as an alternative to selling shares amidst depressed valuations, with both the number and value of deals exceeding the same period last year.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin the process of resuming imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban that was put in place following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The agreement, which follows technical talks between the two nations, includes provisions for third-party monitoring of the water release. While the move is seen as a positive step in easing tensions between the two countries, China will maintain restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This progress is a significant milestone, although some issues remain.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival has transformed from its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost ¬£1 and included free milk, to a world-renowned event. Key milestones include the introduction of the Pyramid stage in 1971, the partnership with CND in 1981, and the devastating fire that destroyed the Pyramid stage in 1994. The festival has also adapted to changing times, with the installation of a "super fence" in 2002 to combat gatecrashers and the inclusion of hip-hop headliners like Jay-Z in 2008, and Stormzy in 2019. This year's festival will be the last before a fallow year in 2026.</p>

The hawk, which was blamed for attacks on about 50 people, was captured in April. Falconer Wayne Housden has been training the bird and has built an aviary for it. He plans to take Bomber Harris to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August and eventually release him in the autumn, noting that the hawk's behavior was likely hormonal or territorial.</p>

The ministry wants to ensure that small gold loan borrowers are not negatively affected by the stricter rules.

The ministry also proposes delaying the implementation of the new rules until January 1, 2026, to allow lenders adequate preparation. (not investment advice)</p>
