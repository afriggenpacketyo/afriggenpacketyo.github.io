        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has officially signed 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club-record fee of up to £69 million. The deal, which surpasses the previous record set by Alexander Isak, commits Woltemade to a six-year contract. Described as a technically skilled forward despite his towering height, Woltemade had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals. The signing is seen as a crucial move for Newcastle, especially given the uncertainty surrounding Isak's future at the club.</p>

          <p>Following the high-profile trade of star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer addressed concerns about the team's future. Schottenheimer stated that the team's goals and standards have not changed, emphasizing that winning a championship is a collective effort and not dependent on a single player. He acknowledged Parsons' talent but stressed the importance of the team's overall depth and unity. Meanwhile, Parsons has arrived at the Packers' facility, with oddsmakers significantly increasing Green Bay's championship odds after the acquisition.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been responsible for over €1.1 million in parliamentary administrative fines since 2017, constituting more than half of the total penalties issued to all political parties combined. The fines were levied for violations including illegal campaign donations, misuse of funds, and false financial reporting. The most significant transgression involved accepting illegal donations from a Swiss company for election advertising. An AfD spokesperson attributed the issues to the party's relative inexperience in its early years and stated that stricter internal controls are now in place.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its security partnership with Somalia by providing military training to Somali security officials as part of its Global Security Initiative (GSI). This program aims to help Somalia develop a self-reliant defense force to combat the extremist group al-Shabab, particularly as the African Union mission prepares to withdraw. This military scholarship follows recent law enforcement and border security training for other Somali officials in China. The cooperation also extends to anti-piracy efforts, aligning with China's naval and fishing interests in the strategically important Gulf of Aden region.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration effectively shut down the widely used climate.gov website and fired its production team, many of the original members are working to resurrect its content through a new non-profit organization. The new effort, climate.us, aims not only to restore public access to accessible climate science information but also to expand its mission to offer climate-related services to local governments. Led by the former managing editor, the volunteer team is seeking funding to continue their work, driven by a sense that the administration is attempting to hide taxpayer-funded scientific information from the public.</p>

          <p>The Ndlovu Youth Choir from South Africa has released a Zulu-language version of Queen's iconic song "Bohemian Rhapsody," marking the first time the band has ever authorized a translation of the anthem. The project received the blessing of Queen's surviving members and the Mercury Phoenix Trust, coinciding with the song's 50th anniversary. The choir's artistic director noted the connection to Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar. The translation process was meticulous, aiming to preserve the original's meaning while weaving in African musical traditions, creating a unique cultural tribute to the rock classic.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has completed two significant transfers, with striker Christopher Nkunku joining AC Milan in a permanent £36 million deal and Nicolas Jackson moving to Bayern Munich on loan. The loan for Jackson includes a substantial £13 million fee and a £56.2 million option to buy for the German club. These departures are part of a broader strategy to balance the club's finances, having raised over £300 million from player sales this summer. Both players, who signed in 2023, had limited opportunities following the arrival of new signings at the club.</p>

          <p>Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a significant and sustained drop in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S., reaching their lowest point since March 2020. Despite this positive trend, which shows deaths falling by roughly a third from their 2023 peak, President Donald Trump continues to frame the fentanyl crisis as a growing threat to justify policies like mandatory minimum sentences.

          <p>A 31-year-old tradition of setting off fireworks at Pace High School's home football games was saved after the Santa Rosa County Board of Commissioners intervened. The school district had recently banned fireworks on its property due to liability concerns, a decision that disappointed many in the community. To preserve the tradition, county commissioners approved the use of nearby county-owned land for the fireworks display. The solution allowed fans at the game to still enjoy the show, which was met with loud cheers, ensuring the long-standing community ritual could continue safely.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has recently purchased and continues to add to its stake in Pool Corp., a leading distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment. The company's business model has two distinct sides: a cyclical pool construction segment, and a more stable, recurring revenue stream from essential maintenance products. After a pandemic-fueled surge in construction led to a stock price correction, Buffett's team likely identified an opportunity based on the long-term, steady growth inherent in the maintenance side of the business. This investment aligns with Buffett's strategy of buying well-run companies for long-term holds. (not investment advice)</p>

The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, hoping they will gain valuable experience and maintain connections to their homeland. Previously, the draft age started at 25, but the travel ban led many teenage boys to leave before turning 18. While officials hope this will prevent a "lost generation," some demographers fear the move will simply accelerate youth emigration.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb argued that the government's "skimpy process" for those living in the interior of the country could violate their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.
