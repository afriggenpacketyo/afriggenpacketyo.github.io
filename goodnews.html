          <p>Chinese geologists are establishing a dominant position in the global competition for critical minerals by utilizing the world's largest electromagnetic antenna and a suite of related cutting-edge technologies. A recent China Geological Survey study reveals this advanced arsenal enables the detection of vital ore and energy resources buried several kilometers deep, significantly outpacing international rivals. This technological superiority provides China with a crucial strategic advantage in securing essential materials such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earths, which are indispensable for the development of green technologies and future industrial leadership. This advancement underscores China's rapid progress in geological exploration.</p>

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs clinched their inaugural victory of the season, overcoming an initial sloppy performance to defeat the New York Giants 22-9. Despite early offensive stagnation and dropped passes, quarterback Patrick Mahomes ignited the team in the second half, orchestrating key drives that included a touchdown pass to Tyquan Thornton. The Chiefs' formidable defense was instrumental, effectively neutralizing Giants quarterback Russell Wilson. While New York's rookie Cam Skattebo showed promise with 60 rushing yards and a touchdown, the Chiefs ultimately prevailed. This win improves Kansas City's record to 1-2, as the Giants remain winless at 0-3.</p>

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" UAV, an advanced uncrewed stealth combat drone, is reportedly being strategically adapted for pivotal roles in intelligent naval warfare. Recent evidence, including the observation of visible folding hinges on its wings and its prominent display on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, strongly suggests its intended deployment on aircraft carriers. This significant development could position the GJ-11 as the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, thereby substantially bolstering the People's Liberation Army's naval capabilities and marking a formidable leap forward in military technology and strategic power projection.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed that media moguls Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, alongside Michael Dell, are potentially involved in a deal for the United States to acquire control of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle founder Larry Ellison's participation in the group is already confirmed, with the proposed structure granting Americans control over six of the seven seats on TikTok's planned board. This initiative seeks to alleviate US national security concerns regarding the app's algorithm and its Chinese ownership, thereby averting a ban that President Trump had previously delayed multiple times. Trump, who initially opposed TikTok, now admits to being a "fan."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research highlights that children who develop exceptional social skills are typically raised by parents who consistently employ nine crucial practices from an early age. These foundational strategies involve openly discussing and normalizing emotions, actively modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering genuine confidence by allowing children to try and sometimes fail. Additionally, these parents teach effective conflict resolution, validate their children's feelings, and guide them in recognizing subtle social cues. They also refrain from immediately solving every conflict, frame mistakes as valuable learning opportunities, and prioritize active listening over lecturing. Such an upbringing cultivates emotional safety and authentic connection, equipping children for resilient, healthy relationships.</p>

          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has unequivocally stated that comprehensive welfare reform "must happen," pledging to advance changes despite the government's recent reversal on a major policy aimed at cutting disability and health-related benefits.

He contends that the existing system is "unhealthy" and contributes to rising benefit expenditures, advocating for the deployment of specialized work coaches to provide voluntary assistance.</p>
