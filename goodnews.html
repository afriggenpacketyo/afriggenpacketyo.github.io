          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of approximately $15 billion in bitcoin, marking the largest forfeiture in its history. The funds were linked to a massive "pig butchering" investment fraud scheme allegedly orchestrated by Chen Zhi, who remains at large. Prosecutors state that Zhi's Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group operated forced-labor compounds where trafficked individuals were compelled to scam victims worldwide. The scheme involved building trust with victims online before convincing them to transfer cryptocurrency for fraudulent investments.</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is enjoying a remarkable start to the season at Napoli after leaving Manchester City on a free transfer, prompting questions about whether City let him go prematurely. Despite a decorated career at City, the 34-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements but has since demonstrated his continued high-level performance with a strong record of goals and assists. His recent form, including for the Belgian national team, suggests he could still have been a key asset for his former club. De Bruyne continues to show little sign of slowing down ahead of the next World Cup.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common question among seniors considering a reverse mortgage is who retains ownership of the house. With this type of loan, the homeowner keeps the legal title and ownership of the property, while the lender places a lien on it to secure the loan balance. The loan, plus interest, typically becomes due when the homeowner sells the home, moves out, or passes away. At that point, the homeowner's heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the house or sell it to settle the debt, keeping any remaining equity. This financial tool allows older homeowners to access their home equity without making monthly payments.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump conducted a high-profile, day-long trip through the Middle East to mark a new ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The deal, brokered with significant U.S. pressure, involves the release of remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a cessation of major combat operations in Gaza. Trump hailed the agreement as a historic achievement, suggesting it could lead to "everlasting peace" in the region. However, the trip was more of a victory lap than a detailed negotiation, leaving critical questions about the long-term governance and stability of Gaza unanswered.</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 55 aircraft in September, bringing its total for the first nine months of 2025 to 440, positioning the company for its most productive year since before the 737 Max groundings. The majority of the recent deliveries were 737 Max planes, with major customers including Ryanair and Southwest Airlines receiving new aircraft. The company is reportedly stabilizing its production and aims to increase the 737 Max output rate to 42 per month by the end of the year. Boeing also secured 48 net new orders in September, including a significant purchase of 787 Dreamliners by Turkish Airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, upholding the $1.4 billion in damages he was ordered to pay to the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones was found liable for defamation after repeatedly claiming the 2012 massacre was a hoax. His attorneys had argued the massive judgment amounted to a "financial death penalty" that could never be paid, but the high court declined to hear the case without comment. The decision effectively finalizes the landmark verdict against Jones for the suffering he caused the victims' families.</p>

          <p>The explosive growth of artificial intelligence is creating a new and valuable asset class in commercial real estate known as "powered land." This refers to land that has been prepared with the necessary permits, utility commitments, and infrastructure to support large-scale data centers, with a primary focus on securing massive amounts of electricity. Real estate investment firms like Hines are now pivoting to acquire and develop these AI-ready sites, as securing power has become a greater challenge than constructing the buildings themselves.

          <p>Meta is rolling out new content restrictions for teen users on Instagram, aligning the platform's standards with the PG-13 movie rating. Under the new policy, accounts for users under 18 will automatically be placed in a more restrictive setting, which will block search results for sensitive topics like "alcohol" and "gore." The feature will also prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Parents will have the option to choose an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting, as Meta aims to reassure them that it is working to provide a safer, age-appropriate experience by default.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with every business division achieving record revenue. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 34% surge in banking revenues and strong performance in its services and markets segments. CEO Jane Fraser credited the positive results to the execution of the company's strategy and investments in new products, digital assets, and AI. Despite the strong performance, expenses rose by 9%, partly due to costs associated with the sale of its Mexico business, Banamex. The bank's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year. (not investment advice)</p>
