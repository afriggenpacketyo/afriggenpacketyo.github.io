        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There is no universal rule for how much screen time is safe for children, but a consensus among experts suggests a cautious approach based on developmental stages. For toddlers, real-world interaction is crucial for cognitive and motor skill development, with recommendations ranging from "screen-free until three" to a maximum of one hour daily for two-year-olds. As children grow, the focus shifts from time limits to content quality and supervised use, ensuring screens don't replace essential activities like imaginative play and social interaction. For adolescents, open communication is key to navigating online risks, while parents are encouraged to model healthy media habits for the entire family.</p>

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish is experiencing a significant career resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where he had limited playing time. His recent man-of-the-match performances, marked by multiple assists in consecutive games, have made him a central figure for his new club. Despite his excellent form, Grealish was notably left out of the latest England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel, raising questions about his chances of making the World Cup team. Everton's manager and pundits have praised his renewed energy and creativity, suggesting the consistent playing time is allowing him to showcase his talent once again.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay, the renowned celebrity chef, announced that he was recently diagnosed with Basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. In a social media post, he shared a photo of his face bandaged after having a cancerous growth removed and thanked his medical team for their prompt action. The 58-year-old chef attributed the cancer to prolonged sun exposure and used the opportunity to urge his followers to be vigilant about using sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is typically not life-threatening but requires medical intervention to prevent it from spreading or causing disfigurement.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly submitted an improved £35 million bid for Crystal Palace's captain and defender, Marc Guehi, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Negotiations between the two Premier League clubs are ongoing as the transfer deadline approaches, with Palace seeking an additional £5 million in bonuses. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, prompting Palace to consider a sale rather than lose him on a free transfer next summer. The South London club is actively looking to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's potential move to Anfield.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich and instructed him to return to London. The decision was made after fellow striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during Chelsea's match against Fulham, leaving the team with only one fit senior striker. Jackson was already in Germany to complete his medical when the club revoked permission for the move. The sudden collapse of the deal has reportedly angered the 24-year-old player, but Chelsea's unexpected shortage of attacking options forced the club to make the dramatic reversal.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and tragically, seven deaths. Investigators traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing of cooling tower systems to prevent future clusters of the severe pneumonia-like illness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. The device analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable to the human ear and compares them against a vast database of patient data. A large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries in London found that the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions. This innovation could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive crucial treatment sooner and potentially improving long-term health outcomes.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic 'The Toxic Avenger' updates the schlocky original with a higher-quality production and a cast including Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon. Directed by Macon Blair, the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of its Troma predecessor but anchors the story with a more sincere emotional core and a pointed environmental message. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being thrown into toxic waste, becomes a disfigured mutant hero fighting a corrupt pharmaceutical corporation. While the film's polished look may feel disconnected from the original's low-budget charm, it delivers a diverting and gruesome homage to the anti-hero.</p>
