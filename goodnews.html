          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated he is confident that courts will support President Trump's tariff agenda, despite a recent federal court setback. An appeals court issued a temporary stay protecting the tariffs during litigation, pausing a decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade that blocked the tariffs. Hassett argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president the authority to impose tariffs. He added that the White House has studied every possible way to pursue Trump's tariff agenda and is confident in its legal soundness.</p>

The Ministry of Justice stated that some prison officers will use Tasers on a trial basis this summer, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.

          <p>At the Shangri-La Dialogue, ASEAN defence chiefs emphasized individual agency, asserting that they are not mere pawns in the rivalry between the US and China. Philippine Secretary of National Defence Gilberto Teodoro Jnr stated that smaller states' legitimate actions should not be portrayed as being carried out at the behest of major powers. This came after US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Indo-Pacific allies to boost military spending and cooperation to counter the threat from China. The observer noted that those views were unlikely to be fully endorsed by ASEAN due to economic uncertainties from US tariffs and the desire to diversify trade ties.</p>

          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist shares six things parents can do to build trust with their children. These include normalizing talking about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling instead of interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies. Trust is built in small moments and by showing children how to navigate emotions and difficult situations, and this can be done by modeling it in an open and honest manner.</p>
