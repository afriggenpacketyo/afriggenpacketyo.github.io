          <p>Donald Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey governor, calling him a 'terrific America First Candidate.' Trump stated that Ciattarelli has gone 'ALL IN' and would work closely with the Trump administration to grow the economy, cut taxes, secure the border, and stop migrant crime. Ciattarelli responded on X, expressing his honor at receiving the endorsement and promising to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The endorsement comes after Ciattarelli was once a harsh Trump critic, but seems to have changed his stance since those comments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York proved anticlimactic, signaling caution in the art market amid economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The sale, featuring works by modern masters like Mondrian and Picasso, fell short of pre-sale expectations, with many objects presold to guaranteed bids. While the collection totaled $272 million, the auction lacked the enthusiastic bidding seen in 2022. The article notes that the weakness of the Warhol market and uncertainty in financial markets contributed to the subdued atmosphere.</p>
