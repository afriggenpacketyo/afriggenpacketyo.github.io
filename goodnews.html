          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, highlighting his administration's efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Trump's speech followed the disbanding of several student clubs and the removal of books related to diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions undermine the values and education of the academies. Trump also referenced his previous appearance in 2020, addressing questions about his health after a slow walk down a ramp, dismissing concerns as related to a slippery surface.</p>

          <p>England defeated Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs in a one-off Test match, thanks to Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul. Bashir's performance helped dismiss Zimbabwe for 255 in their second innings at Trent Bridge. Despite the victory, England's seam bowling lacked penetration on a lifeless surface, allowing Sean Williams to score 88 runs. Harry Brook took a spectacular catch, and Bashir became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets, marking his third five-wicket haul before age 22.</p>

While shootings have decreased, violent crime rates in Minneapolis have not significantly improved since 2020. The police department continues to face an officer shortage, but O'Hara is committed to restoring pride in the profession and changing the department's culture, while the Justice Department ended investigations into six police agencies, reform efforts will continue.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reported a record number of Americans seeking residency in the UK, with over 6,000 applications in the year leading up to March. The surge in applications is attributed to the polarized political climate in the United States, with many pointing to Donald Trump's second presidency.

          <p>ValueAct Capital has acquired a significant stake in Rocket Companies (RKT), a financial technology firm specializing in mortgage, real estate, and personal finance. Rocket's technological advancements have made it the leading mortgage originator in the U.S., processing loans at a fraction of the cost compared to its competitors. However, the company's share price has not reflected its competitive advantage due to a small float, controlled ownership, and complex share class structure. ValueAct's investment could potentially lift the share price by addressing these issues and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance Rocket's operational efficiency.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, his first since returning to office, amid controversy over the administration's ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military. West Point has disbanded several cadet clubs formed around race and gender in compliance with Trump's executive order. Some at West Point have protested the measures, with one professor resigning in response. Trump's address comes after Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized a shift in foreign policy against open-ended conflicts at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decrease, mirroring the sharp increase seen during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report indicates a nearly 12% drop in murders year over year, with 2024 showing further declines. Early data for 2025 suggests the potential for the lowest murder rate in US history. This decline is attributed to the easing of pandemic-related stressors, government interventions, and community violence interruption programs. Despite these positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality due to bad news bias.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Public</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:15:01 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, ending 17 years of federal control. This move is supported by Trump ally Bill Ackman, who has invested in the firms. The firms guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages. Elizabeth Warren warned against the move, suggesting it could benefit investors at the expense of homebuyers. A Trump administration proposed ending the conservatorship in his first term, but ultimately did not. The change may push up mortgage rates.</p>
