          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled six upcoming concerts in June due to an ongoing battle with the flu, expressing devastation and sincere apologies to his fans on Instagram. The 80-year-old singer reassured fans that he would return to the stage soon, signing his message as "Sir Rod." The canceled shows raised concerns about his performance at Glastonbury later this month, where he is scheduled to perform for the first time in over two decades. Stewart also canceled a performance at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace earlier this week due to doctor's orders, citing a lingering sickness. </p>

          <p>Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers for $13.65 million, ending his free agency. The deal is pending a physical, and Rodgers will hold a press conference on Tuesday after minicamp practice.

UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while preserving Olympic sports programs and staff. The school will also maintain current scholarship limits for at least a year to provide more revenue sharing money to each player. Jarmond emphasized the importance of investing in the athletics program to compete at the highest level, while also acknowledging the need for creative revenue generation.</p>

The series win raises questions about whether the "new" England team can perform under pressure when it matters most.
