          <p>The Singapore Grand Prix is proving to be a major economic catalyst, significantly boosting tourism not only for the island nation but also across the wider Asia-Pacific region. Data from marketing platform Sojern indicates that a substantial number of F1 attendees, particularly from North America, Europe, and Australia, are combining their race trips with visits to other countries like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia, often through bundled travel packages. This trend highlights a broader consumer shift towards prioritizing experiential travel over acquiring physical goods. The event has also evolved into a week-long affair, attracting global leaders and business travelers to concurrent forums, creating a substantial economic windfall and fostering regional integration.</p>

Humpton expressed support for the administration's strategy, emphasizing the collaborative effort needed to build out this marketplace.

          <p>The Detroit Tigers secured their spot in the American League Division Series by defeating the Cleveland Guardians 6-3 on the road. Key performances included Dillon Dingler's sixth-inning home run and Wenceel Pérez's two-run single in a decisive four-run seventh inning. This marks the second consecutive season the Tigers have won a Wild Card Series away from home. Detroit will now face the AL West champion Seattle Mariners in the Division Series, with Game 1 scheduled for Saturday. The Guardians, despite a remarkable comeback to win the AL Central, ultimately ran out of momentum in the best-of-three series.</p>

          <p>California has introduced a newly redesigned driver's license and identification card featuring enhanced security measures, including a first-in-the-nation digital signature. The new cards also showcase updated visuals, replacing previous motifs with images of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, so there is no immediate need for motorists to update them. These periodic updates by the Department of Motor Vehicles aim to improve security and combat counterfeiting, building on previous changes like the 2018 implementation of REAL ID standards following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic is taking a "slower" approach to the Lakers' training camp to prevent injuries after a demanding offseason playing with Slovenia's national team in the EuroBasket. Coach JJ Redick emphasized the importance of being in championship shape, leading to more intense drills. Doncic, who has slimmed down, feels his national team experience prepared him for the season, and teammates praise his court vision and creativity. The team is focusing on integrating his style of play and ensuring both physical and mental readiness for the upcoming season, with some key players like LeBron James sidelined for the first preseason game.</p>

          <p>After years of attempts, President Trump has secured a significant deal with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower U.S. drug prices to match those in other developed countries. Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering certain drugs at steep discounts. While new drugs will launch at international parity, existing drug price reductions primarily apply to Medicaid patients. The administration utilized a threat of 100% tariffs on companies not manufacturing products in the U.S., with a three-year exemption as incentive. This marks a major shift in the drug industry's stance against Trump's pricing demands. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. college rankings, now a cultural staple, originated as controversial experiments, as detailed in an article. Early attempts, like Edwin Embree's 1934 list and Kendric Babcock's 1911 federal study, faced immense backlash and suppression due to their perceived recklessness and social biases. The modern era of rankings, spearheaded by U.S. News & World Report in the 1980s, emerged as higher education became a mass-consumer good, providing a "map of the American meritocracy." While methods have evolved, rankings continue to shape public perception, influence admissions, and prompt institutions to adapt their strategies, despite ongoing debate about their validity and impact.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's economy is undergoing a profound restructuring, driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs rather than collapsing. Unlike their predecessors, this cohort, largely born after the famine era, is technically trained, innovation-driven, and focused on co-creation with government and other partners. Many hail from business-centric provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong, blending past scarcity experiences with market opportunities and technological advancements. Their increasing integration into global systems and focus on competitiveness at scale are identified as key factors in China's economic resilience and ongoing transformation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, emphasizing its role as a practice of survival and healing. Originating with enslaved Africans in Cuba, Lucumí adapted and persisted despite forced conversion attempts by colonizers, focusing on health, well-being, and connection to divine orishas. Scholars are working to destigmatize the religion, which is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black beliefs and its resistance to white supremacy. The practice centers on "iwa pele," or good character, honoring nature and ancestors, and fostering community balance.</p>
