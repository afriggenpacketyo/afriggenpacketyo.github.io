          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 22:54:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines why Boeing aircraft are a recurring feature in trade agreements under the Trump administration, suggesting it is due to their high profile, which serves as a visible symbol of efforts to reduce trade surpluses. The high value of these deals allows partner countries to demonstrate commitment, while aircraft purchases are less politically contentious domestically compared to commodities like steel. Additionally, the long delivery timelines for these planes mean countries can make purchase announcements without immediate financial strain, although there is also a genuine need for new aircraft in the growing international tourism market.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index reached a new record high, climbing past the 44,000 mark after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The market rally, led by technology stocks, is fueled by investor speculation that the next leader from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may introduce new fiscal stimulus measures to boost the economy. Analysts suggest that while short-term political uncertainty may cause volatility, the leadership change could lead to greater long-term policy stability and a pro-growth environment for equities.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was activated from the injured list and immediately returned to the lineup, a welcome boost for the team which has been struggling offensively. Muncy had been sidelined with an oblique injury, his second stint on the injured list this season, during which the team posted a losing record. Manager Dave Roberts expressed that Muncy's presence adds significant length and power to their batting order. His return is the first of several key players expected back soon to help the team in its final push toward the playoffs.</p>

          <h2>New 'Durian Express' Shipping Service Aims to Deliver Fresher Fruit to Northeast China</h2>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is launching a "durian express" shipping service and building a new fruit transit center to meet the growing demand for the popular Southeast Asian fruit in the country's northeast. This initiative aims to significantly reduce shipping times from countries like Malaysia and Thailand from nearly two weeks to as little as six days. The goal is to ensure the freshness of the perishable fruit upon arrival in a market of roughly 100 million consumers. Analysts note that northeastern China is a relatively untapped market for durians, and overcoming logistical challenges is key to its growth.</p>

          <h2>California Legislature Passes Bill to Ban Deceptive Online Puppy Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 19:53:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill aimed at shutting down the "puppy mill pipeline" by banning online pet brokers and dealers who misrepresent the origin of the animals they sell. The legislation targets websites and middlemen who source dogs from out-of-state commercial breeders but market them as being from small, local operations. This move closes a loophole in a 2019 law that banned pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs but did not cover the growing online market. If signed into law, the bill will provide greater transparency for consumers and help prevent the sale of sick or poorly bred pets.</p>
