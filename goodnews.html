          <p>A history enthusiast using a metal detector discovered the site of a medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, after spotting a peculiar symbol on an 18th-century map. The hobbyist, G√∂ran Bengtsson, noticed a rectangular mark labeled "Klosterkullen" (monastery hill) on a 1760 map. Archaeologists then used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the existence of the monastery ruins, revealing walls approximately 6.5 feet thick. The monastery is believed to be the original location of √Ös Abbey, dating back to the late 1100s, before it was moved in the 13th century, marking a significant find for Swedish history.</p>

The initiative, effective through June 30, provides dedicated entry lanes for eligible travelers at Haneda, Fukuoka, Gimpo, and Gimhae airports. This is the first time a Japanese airport has designated a lane for a specific nation, aiming to enhance convenience and expedite immigration for registered visitors who have previously traveled to either country within the past year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing data from over 43,000 respondents across 30 European countries indicates that parents, compared to childfree individuals, report a greater sense of meaning in their lives but lower overall life satisfaction. The study, conducted by sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde, found that this trend is especially pronounced for mothers, and that the level of life satisfaction is significantly influenced by family policies and societal attitudes toward children in different countries. Scandinavian countries, with their robust childcare support and gender equality, show less disparity in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents, suggesting that societal support plays a crucial role in parental well-being.</p>
