          <p>Honeywell International's shares experienced a significant 7% rally after the company announced a robust quarterly earnings beat, surpassing expectations for organic revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and margins. This strong financial performance is generating considerable investor optimism as the company prepares for next week's spin-off of its advanced materials business, Solstice. Industry analysts suggest that this strategic move will enhance clarity regarding Honeywell's core aerospace operations, thereby unlocking greater shareholder value. The CNBC Investing Club, led by Jim Cramer, has recommended holding the stock, anticipating further appreciation as the spin-off event draws nearer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, known for his critical stance on the Dallas Cowboys, has offered rare praise for owner Jerry Jones's strategic decision to prioritize quarterback Dak Prescott over trading star pass rusher Micah Parsons. Smith emphasized the Cowboys' impressive offensive performance this season, noting Prescott's high rankings in passing yards and touchdowns, which have contributed to the team's competitive 3-3-1 record. He posited that if the Cowboys maintain their offensive momentum and achieve a playoff victory, Jones's controversial strategy will be unequivocally justified. This article captures a significant shift in Smith's typical assessment of the team's management and prospects.</p>

          <p>Kering, the French luxury group owning brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced an 8.7% surge in its shares after announcing a narrowed sales decline and exceeding quarterly earnings estimates. While Gucci, its largest brand, still saw a 14% year-on-year sales drop, this represented a "sharp sequential improvement" from the previous quarter's 25% plunge. CEO Luca de Meo acknowledged that the group's performance lags the broader market but affirmed a strong commitment to a business turnaround, evidenced by recent actions such as selling its beauty unit. Analysts view these results and management's initiatives as initial successes in revitalizing the company's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Strong, acclaimed for his profound transformations in roles such as Roy Cohn and soon Mark Zuckerberg, describes his intense, immersive acting process as "witchy." This method involves extensive research, pouring over public footage, and remaining in character on set, aiming for the role to "take possession" of him. For his latest film, "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," portraying Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau, Strong benefited from direct access to both Landau and Springsteen, enabling "organic discovery" in his performance. He reflected on the emotional demands of playing dark characters and found working on the Springsteen biopic a contrasting, therapeutic experience.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have formally endorsed "Readiness 2030," a comprehensive plan designed to significantly enhance Europe's defense capabilities against external threats by the end of the decade. This strategic initiative is largely prompted by heightened concerns over Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine and its wider implications for European security. A primary focus of the plan is the development of robust drone defenses through a new European Drone Defense Initiative, forming a key component of the "Eastern Flank Watch" to fortify the continent's eastern borders. The strategy mandates that member states launch concrete defense projects by mid-2026, aiming for 40% of military procurements to be conducted jointly by late 2027.</p>

Kelce, expressing his lifelong fandom, stated his desire to help revitalize the parks for future generations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 1.5% in September compared to August, reaching their highest pace in seven months, primarily influenced by a decline in mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased to 6.17%, contributing to a slight improvement in housing affordability. Despite this positive trend in sales, home prices continue to be stubbornly high, with the median price hitting $415,200, reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year increase and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. While housing inventory has increased by 14% from a year ago, it still remains historically constrained, affecting overall market balance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. government shutdown is anticipated to have a relatively minor impact on most mortgage applications, given that the majority of the market is managed by private lenders. Nevertheless, borrowers applying for government-backed loans through agencies such as the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), or Department of Agriculture (USDA) may encounter slight processing delays due to potential federal employee furloughs. The National Association of Realtors advises veterans to consult their lenders regarding timelines for VA loans, while the USDA will temporarily suspend the issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans. Furthermore, homebuyers in flood zones could face delays in obtaining federally mandated flood insurance, as the FEMA-administered program cannot process new or renewal policies during a shutdown.
