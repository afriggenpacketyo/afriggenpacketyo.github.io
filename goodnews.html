          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested by London police on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, following a fire at a house in north London previously occupied by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The arrest is also connected to two other nearby fires, including a vehicle fire and another at a property also linked to Starmer. Counterterrorism police are leading the investigation due to the property's prior association with a high-profile public figure, though Starmer no longer resides there, having moved to Downing Street after becoming Prime Minister. The fires are being treated as suspicious, and investigations are ongoing to determine their cause and any potential links.</p>

          <p>Fintech companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, which previously benefited from rising interest rates that boosted their net interest income, now face a challenge as interest rates decline. Lower rates raise questions about the sustainability of their business models, particularly for those heavily reliant on net interest income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams by offering services like crypto trading and mobile plans to mitigate the impact of falling rates. ClearBank, a payments infrastructure startup, experienced a pre-tax loss due to the shift from interest income to fee-based income, highlighting the potential impact of lower rates on the sector.</p>

The location was moved to Windsor Castle due to ongoing construction at Buckingham Palace, which affects the traditional elements of a state visit, such as the state banquet. Such visits are considered opportunities to build relationships and focus on trade, cultural, and defense links.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls declining in the first few months of the year. Job vacancies have also fallen, suggesting a cooling labor market. While wage growth remains relatively strong, analysts believe that the recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to the slowdown in hiring. The Bank of England is expected to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts due to concerns about inflationary pressures from sticky wage growth.</p>
