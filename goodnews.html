          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by strong results in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue was $45.68 billion against an estimated $44.06 billion, although net income fell compared to the previous year, which had included a significant one-time gain. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also pointed to persistent risks from trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and high fiscal deficits. The report sets a positive tone as other major banks prepare to release their quarterly results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a £650 million scheme to offer drivers grants of up to £3,750 to purchase new electric cars, aiming to accelerate the shift from petrol and diesel vehicles. The discounts will apply to eligible models costing up to £37,000 and will be managed by car manufacturers, who will reduce the price at the dealership. This initiative is part of the government's commitment to ban new fossil fuel car sales by 2030. However, critics and industry leaders note that consumer demand and the insufficient number of public charging points remain significant hurdles to widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Beijing by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that relations between the two countries have "turned around" after years of diplomatic tension. Xi emphasized a commitment to mutual respect and cooperation, a sentiment echoed by Albanese, who welcomed the opportunity to advance Australia's interests. The meeting marks a significant thaw in a relationship previously strained by trade disputes and political disagreements. This diplomatic reset comes as China seeks to strengthen ties with key trading partners amid ongoing economic and political pressures from the United States.</p>

          <p>A four-person international crew, led by veteran NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, has successfully completed a 20-day commercial mission to the International Space Station, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The flight was the fourth private astronaut mission organized by Axiom Space, a company working to build a commercial successor to the ISS. During their time in orbit, the crew conducted a variety of scientific experiments and educational outreach events. The mission's safe conclusion marks another key step in the development of a commercial economy in low-Earth orbit, independent of government-led programs.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Teruzuki, a Japanese destroyer sunk by U.S. torpedoes during the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. The warship was found over 2,600 feet below the surface in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound, a region famous for its many sunken WWII vessels. The remotely operated vehicle found the ship's hull severed, but remarkably, it was still armed with unused depth charges. The discovery provides the first visual record of the Teruzuki since it sank over 80 years ago, offering new insights into a pivotal moment in naval history.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to encourage people with cash savings to invest in the stock market, as part of a broader strategy to boost the nation's financial services sector. Under the proposals, banks will be prompted to send their customers information about investment opportunities, supported by a government advertising campaign. The Treasury also intends to review the risk warnings on investment products to ensure they are not overly cautious. This initiative aims to help savers achieve better returns while stimulating economic growth, though it may raise concerns about exposing inexperienced individuals to market risks.

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, maintaining a pace consistent with the government's annual target of around 5%. This growth was supported by government stimulus measures and a temporary lull in trade escalations with the United States, which allowed for a surge in exports. However, analysts warn that this momentum may not be sustainable due to persistent challenges, including weak consumer confidence and a deepening crisis in the property sector. The data reflects an economy navigating significant domestic headwinds while facing an uncertain global trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The high price is largely due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. The company has opened its first showroom in Mumbai and plans another in New Delhi. Analysts believe this initial launch is a strategic move to "test the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market, rather than a push for immediate high-volume sales.</p>

          <p>In an effort to encourage marriage and address declining birth rates, the central Chinese province of Hubei has increased its paid marriage leave from the national minimum of three days to fifteen. This policy is the latest among various local government initiatives aimed at creating a more "family-friendly society." The move comes as China faces a steep decline in marriage registrations, which hit a record low in the last year, and a slight increase in divorces. Despite such incentives, many young people in China still view the high cost of weddings and living as a significant barrier to marriage.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will require that children be taught how to recognize and counter misogyny as part of their relationships and sex education. The updated curriculum, which will be fully implemented by 2026, aims to help pupils identify positive role models and resist harmful online influences. It will also require schools to engage proactively with parents and allow them to view all curriculum materials. The guidance avoids imposing strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school, a move criticized by some as weakening safeguards.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy from Minnesota has made a full recovery after a freak accident in which an arrow penetrated his brain, nearly exiting the back of his skull. The boy, Gus Deterding, was carrying a youth bow and arrow when he slipped on ice and fell face-first onto the arrow. Scans revealed the arrow had passed through the middle of his brain, an injury that doctors considered would almost certainly be fatal. In what medical staff and his family are calling a miracle, Gus showed no ill effects and has survived the ordeal without any apparent long-term damage.</p>
