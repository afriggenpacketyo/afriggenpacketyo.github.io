          <p>The 78th Cannes Film Festival began with a dress code emphasizing modesty, reportedly surprising jury member Halle Berry, who had to alter her planned outfit. The festival also addresses concerns about President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on foreign films, with Cannes president Iris Knobloch expressing hope for global film industry cooperation. Robert De Niro received the Palme d'Or, presented by Leonardo DiCaprio, and used his acceptance speech to criticize President Trump as an "enemy of the arts." The festival opened with a salute to Ukraine and the premiere of Am√©lie Bonnin's French romance, 'Leave One Day'.</p>

          <p>The American Museum of Natural History employs a colony of flesh-eating dermestid beetles to clean animal skeletons for research and display. These beetles, housed in special containers, consume the remaining flesh on carcasses, leaving behind meticulously cleaned bones. The beetles are essential for cleaning delicate skeletons that are too fragile for human hands to handle. The colony, which originated in Africa in the 1930s, processes thousands of specimens, including birds and other small animals, with a soft, crackling sound permeating the room where they work.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. Manfred announced a change in league policy, stating that permanent ineligibility would end upon death, leading to the reinstatement of 17 players. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can now be considered for induction. The Hall of Fame's board will consider their eligibility, though voters are also instructed to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

He was known for his modest lifestyle, giving away most of his salary to help build housing for Uruguay's neglected towns and living on a farm rather than in a presidential estate.

He also considers Christopher Scalia's effort to educate conservatives on literary culture, urging readers to appreciate philosophical and ideological perspectives in literature. Douthat argues that successful politically themed art, whether right-wing or left-wing, captures aspects of reality that resonate even with those holding differing worldviews. He uses examples like V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" to illustrate how art can unsettle viewers and convey unexpected truths.</p>
