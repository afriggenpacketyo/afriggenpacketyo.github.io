          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation not posing a significant economic threat. Waller emphasized the importance of moving proactively to avoid potential labor market slowdowns, suggesting an inclination towards early easing. He noted that recent data has been fine, with no big tariff shock to inflation, and that the Fed has been on pause for six months, thinking that there was going to be a big tariff shock to inflation. Stock market futures saw gains after Waller's remarks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This news digest reports on several key events, including the evacuation of 87 Japanese nationals from Iran and Israel due to ongoing conflict. Japan plans to cut super-long-term bond issuances amid rising yields, but the total amount of bonds scheduled for issuance in the current fiscal year through March 2026 is projected to remain unchanged from the initial plan at 176.9 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion), as the Finance Ministry seeks to increase sales of short-term bonds. A former leader of Komeito will retire from politics, and the Japanese imperial couple are scheduled to visit Mongolia in July. Other items include apologies to two men over an illicit probe and the removal of a Tokio pop group member from a TV show over past misconduct.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent commemoration of Chen Yun, a foundational economic planner, signals a shift towards stressing resilient governance over ideology. Xi's remarks emphasized development planning and political resilience, deviating from the strong communist conviction references in his 2015 address. Chen was portrayed as a model of disciplined governance and a technocrat embracing policy logic in uncertain times. Xi's emphasis on Chen's 15-character maxim underscores the need for cadres to navigate a volatile world by following facts and embracing strategic thinking.</p>

          <p>An investment of $5,000 in Alphabet stock at its IPO in 2004 would be worth approximately $412,300 today, including dividends. Alphabet's growth has been driven primarily by digital advertising through Google searches and YouTube. While advertising still makes up a significant portion of the company's revenue, businesses like Google Cloud and Waymo hold potential for future growth. The analysis underscores the significant potential for long-term growth in this stock. (not investment advice)</p>
