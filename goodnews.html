          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a detained Tufts Ph.D. student, from a Louisiana detention facility to Vermont. The court rejected the administration's request to pause a lower court's order, citing the need for Ozturk to have access to legal and medical services. Ozturk was arrested after her student visa was revoked, with the Department of Homeland Security claiming she was involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy.' The ACLU, representing Ozturk, expressed gratitude for the decision, asserting that no one should be detained for their political views. This decision allows her challenge to her confinement to proceed more effectively.</p>

Bowman, a GOP-backed candidate and co-pastor of an evangelical church, will face incumbent Mayor Aftab Pureval in November. Inspired by Vance's inauguration, Bowman's campaign focuses on money management, public safety, infrastructure, lower taxes, and protecting children. While acknowledging Vance as a role model, Bowman emphasizes his focus on Cincinnati's specific needs, highlighting that his job isn't to copy and paste what's going on in the nation, but rather determine what's best for the city.</p>

          <p>Data storage firm Seagate plans to develop a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030, driven by surging demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence. The company's chief commercial officer, BS Teh, highlighted the necessity of such high-capacity drives to meet the industry's growing storage needs. The target capacity is approximately three times that of Seagate's current top-of-the-line 36-terabyte Exos M model. Seagate has been positioning itself as an AI player, benefiting from the increasing demand for storage solutions alongside companies like Nvidia that produce GPUs for AI models.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to unveil further details of its proposed countermeasures to U.S. tariffs. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that the EU is preparing for any scenario if trade talks with the U.S. fail. The EU has currently paused its initial set of retaliatory measures targeting around 21 billion euros worth of U.S. goods. Trump initially imposed a 20% 'reciprocal' tariff on all goods coming from the EU but on April 9 paused the measures for 90 days for negotiations, lowering the duty to 10% until that time.</p>

          <p>The Picasso Museum in Paris is hosting an exhibition titled "Degenerate Art: Modern Art on Trial Under the Nazis," showcasing works that were condemned by Hitler and the Third Reich. These artworks, created by artists like Van Gogh, Klee, and Picasso, were labeled as too modern or un-German. The exhibit highlights the persecution faced by these artists, some of whom were murdered or driven to suicide. The show serves as a reminder of the dangers of political interference in art and the suppression of creative expression, drawing parallels to contemporary debates about "woke" art.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has re-emerged into the public sphere with a sharp critique of President Trump's foreign policy, marking his first broadcast interview since leaving office. Biden attacked Trump's handling of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies, calling some actions 'beneath America.' He also defended his decision to seek re-election despite polling showing many Democrats preferred a new leader. The interview is part of a broader public re-emergence for Biden, who has kept a relatively low profile since leaving the White House, and may be raising his profile for financial gain.</p>

          <p>A higher education expert estimates that federal student loan interest rates are likely to drop for the 2025-2026 academic year. The interest rate on federal direct undergraduate loans could be 6.39% in the 2025-2026 academic year, estimates Kantrowitz. At those new undergraduate rates, every $10,000 a family borrowed would lead to a $113 monthly student loan payment after graduation, assuming the student enrolled in a standard 10-year repayment plan. The rates, which run from July 1 to June 30 of the following year, are based in part on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note.</p>

          <p>A closely watched barometer for used vehicle pricing jumped last month to its highest level since October 2023 as consumers rushed purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index increased 4.9% last month compared with a year earlier to a level of 208.2. Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years. While the tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market.</p>
