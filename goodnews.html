          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the author, emotionally safe parenting prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, viewing misbehavior as a stress signal, and taking responsibility after conflicts by apologizing. To practice this, parents should reflect on their own childhood triggers, see behavior as communication, set boundaries with empathy, and model healthy conflict resolution. By creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves, parents can foster emotional resilience and connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed readiness to swiftly negotiate a trade deal with the United States but indicated the EU needs until July 9 to finalize an agreement. This follows President Trump's threat to impose a 20% tariff on most EU goods, later halved to 10% until July 8 to allow for negotiations. Trump has long criticized the trade relationship with the EU, despite the bloc being a major trading partner. European leaders are advocating for a diplomatic solution, warning that tariffs would harm both economies.</p>
