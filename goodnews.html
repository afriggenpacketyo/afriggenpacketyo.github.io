          <h2>Scientific Study Confirms 'Selective Hearing' as a Genuine Neurological Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists and audiologists have affirmed that "selective hearing" is a real neurological process, not a conscious choice to ignore someone. Known as auditory selective attention, it is the brain's innate ability to filter and prioritize specific sounds, like a single voice in a crowded room, while tuning out background noise. This cognitive function involves the auditory and prefrontal cortices working together to manage focus. While generally normal, a noticeable decline in this ability could indicate underlying hearing loss, as the brain works harder to process sounds, leading to listening fatigue and potential cognitive strain over time.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty is re-recording his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a new album, "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)." After a contentious band breakup in 1972, Fogerty lost control of his own compositions, leading to decades of legal battles and personal frustration where he even stopped performing his hits. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he recently regained the rights to his catalog and has recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band. This project represents a personal and professional victory, allowing him to reclaim his musical heritage.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This partnership is seen as a significant strategic move to strengthen NATO's northern flank, creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates. The collaboration aims to enhance joint operations and security in the North Atlantic, bolstering both nations' defense capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Comedian Jim Gaffigan Laments the Overwhelming Bounty of His Summer Cucumber Harvest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 10:22:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of amateur gardening, specifically his struggle with an overabundant cucumber harvest. He recounts his annual cycle of springtime optimism, which leads him to employ techniques like "succession planting" to ensure a steady supply. However, this strategy inevitably results in a deluge of cucumbers that overwhelms his family's capacity to eat them fresh, in salads, or even as pickles. Gaffigan humorously concludes that his gardening enthusiasm consistently outpaces his planning, leaving him with a comical and relatable problem of having far too much of a good thing.</p>

          <p>In his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of chronic pain, arguing that its source often lies within the brain rather than just the site of an injury. The article highlights the case of a musician with a rare condition causing debilitating, full-body pain, which was successfully treated through an experimental deep brain stimulation procedure. This innovative treatment mapped the unique neural signature of his pain, allowing a device to predict and interrupt the pain signals before they were consciously felt. This research suggests that pain is a malleable brain process that can be targeted and treated directly.</p>

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran correspondent Mark Knoller, who is being remembered as a Washington legend and the unofficial historian of the White House. For over three decades, Knoller meticulously documented the daily activities of eight presidential administrations, earning respect from both sides of the political aisle for his accuracy and dedication. Colleagues recall him as the savant of presidential statistics, an invaluable resource who could instantly recall obscure facts, from the number of speeches a president gave to how many games of basketball were played. His passing marks the end of an era in White House journalism.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, is shifting his focus from his own work to championing other artists through a new exhibition at Maine's Portland Museum of Art. Titled "Painting Energy," the show features over 100 paintings from his foundation's collection, which he gifted to the museum. Katz, celebrated for his distinctive figurative art, says he wants to support emerging and established artists who faced the same difficulties he did early in his career. The collection is curated based on what Katz describes as a painting's "pow" or energy, rather than a specific style, reflecting his appreciation for artists who take creative chances.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building long-term cooperation is more effective than demanding immediate obedience. The key is creating emotional safety, where children feel respected and heard. The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage listening, such as "I believe you" to defuse shame and "Let's figure this out together" to promote problem-solving. These phrases shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, validating a child's feelings and making them more receptive to parental guidance without resorting to power struggles.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibit in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States, tracing it back to three teenage Hawaiian princes in 1885. Princes David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were studying at a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their exhibition of "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the practice. This historical event predates the more widely known popularization of surfing by Duke Kahanamoku in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>As part of its ongoing effort to combat plastic pollution, the state of South Australia will ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers starting Monday. The single-use plastic containers, a staple of sushi takeaways, are being targeted because their small size makes them difficult to process in recycling facilities, causing them to end up in the environment. Environment Minister Susan Close noted that the containers are used for mere seconds but can persist for centuries. This move expands on previous legislation that has already banned items like plastic straws, stirrers, and supermarket bags.</p>
