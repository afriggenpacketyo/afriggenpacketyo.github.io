          <p>Iowa Hawkeyes coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant milestone, tying legendary Ohio State coach Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach with his 205th victory at Iowa. This historic win came as the Hawkeyes defeated Albany 34-7 on Saturday night, marking Ferentz's 23rd season-opening triumph. Despite a sluggish offensive start and a challenging debut for new quarterback Mark Gronowski, who transferred from South Dakota State, the team secured the victory. Running back Xavier Williams delivered a standout performance with 122 yards and a touchdown, stepping up when the starting running back was injured. Ferentz, the longest-tenured active head coach in college football, humbly downplayed the personal achievement, prioritizing the team's success.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a resounding 73-13 victory against Missouri State in their season opener, marking the most points scored by USC since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava had a seamless debut, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before halftime, while the defense recorded five sacks and a pick-six, showcasing significant improvement. This game, originally slated as a marquee matchup but later changed due to USC's move to the Big Ten, served as a dominant, albeit unchallenged, start to the season. The offensive prowess, including three plays of over 60 yards and no punts, indicated the team's readiness despite the lower-tier opponent.</p>

          <p>Florida State delivered a stunning 31-17 upset victory over No. 8 Alabama, abruptly ending the Crimson Tide’s impressive 23-game season-opener winning streak. New quarterback Tommy Castellanos spearheaded Florida State's punishing rushing attack, gaining 78 yards and scoring a touchdown, contributing significantly to the unranked Seminoles' unexpected win. This early-season loss immediately casts doubt on Alabama's College Football Playoff aspirations and intensifies pressure on first-year coach Kalen DeBoer, who took over from legendary Nick Saban. The Seminoles' physical play under new offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn was evident, accumulating 230 rushing yards. Fans celebrated the monumental underdog triumph by swarming the field in Tallahassee.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party is grappling with internal anxiety over who will succeed current chairman Eric Chu Li-luan in October, despite a recent surge in their public favorability. A poll indicated the KMT's favorability rose to 36.3%, surpassing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), whose approval rating fell significantly. This shift presents a crucial opportunity for the KMT to capitalize on growing discontent with the DPP, but the lack of a clear successor for the party leadership is seen by some as a "poisoned chalice," highlighting internal divisions at a volatile time in Taiwanese politics.</p>

          <p>German beer sales are experiencing a significant decline, reaching their lowest point in over 30 years, with a 6.3% slump in the first half of 2025. Conversely, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013, indicating a major shift in German drinking habits. This trend is largely attributed to increasing health awareness, particularly among younger generations, who are opting for alcohol-free alternatives. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting their alcohol-free products at sporting events, recognizing the need to make beer attractive to a more health-conscious youth. While full-strength beer retains its cultural significance in regions like Bavaria, the market is undeniably shifting towards more mindful consumption.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched a new reality dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," presented by Davina McCall, which blends elements of "Love Island" and "Survivor." The premise involves couples meeting briefly, having a fake wedding, and then being isolated on a remote tropical island to test if love can thrive amidst challenging conditions. Contestants face discomforts like mosquitoes, extreme heat, limited clothing, and basic sanitation, which are intended to strip away superficiality and foster deeper connections. The show aims to offer a more authentic dating experience with slightly older contestants, reflecting a trend of people settling down later and seeking genuine relationships.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs, drones, and nuclear atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating threat to British forests. This hairy beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be spreading to the UK via winds across the English Channel, not just imported wood. While the UK claims to have eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and southeast, climate change poses an increasing risk by stressing trees and boosting beetle populations in Europe. The innovative methods aim to protect the UK's 725,000 hectares of spruce, valued at £2.9 billion annually.</p>

          <p>New government data in England reveals that pupils who were partially absent during the first week of school in September 2024 were significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" later in the year, missing at least 10% of school. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize full attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that "every day of school missed is a day stolen from a child's future." While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a greater challenge than pre-Covid levels.

Indonesia's extensive international relationships and status as an economic powerhouse, coupled with the growing influence of middle powers, enable Prabowo to advocate for a philosophy of "constructive pragmatism."
