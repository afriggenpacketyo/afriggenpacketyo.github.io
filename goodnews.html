          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 17:02:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robinhood has finalized its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, marking a strategic shift beyond retail trading into institutional cryptocurrency markets. The all-cash deal provides Robinhood with an immediate international presence, including over 50 active crypto licenses across Europe, the UK, and Asia, as well as an established institutional client base. This move allows Robinhood to offer institutional crypto flows, lending and staking infrastructure, and white-label "crypto-as-a-service" products. Robinhood aims to rebrand itself as a serious player in digital asset finance, focusing on regulation, institutional capital, and cross-border competition. The acquisition of Bitstamp signals Robinhood's intent to compete in the institutional crypto space, potentially boosting its long-term growth and market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber's head of delivery and one of its longest-tenured top executives, is leaving the company after nearly 13 years. Gore-Coty joined Uber in 2012 and played a significant role in its global expansion, particularly in the mobility and delivery sectors. Andrew Macdonald, the company's senior vice president of mobility and business operations, will become chief operating officer, overseeing mobility, delivery, and autonomous businesses. The leadership change comes as Uber reported first-quarter results that beat on earnings but missed on revenue, with the FTC suing Uber over deceptive billing practices. The departure of a long-serving executive signals a transition within Uber, but the appointment of Macdonald ensures continuity in key operational areas. </p>
