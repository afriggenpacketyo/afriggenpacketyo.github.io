          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:04:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, financial experts are analyzing the shifting landscape for savers. The reduction is expected to cause rates on high-yield savings and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts to continue their gradual decline. Consequently, the article suggests that opening a long-term CD now could be an advantageous move to lock in current, higher rates. This strategy would protect savings from potential future rate cuts and provide a guaranteed return in an otherwise unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new range to between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024 and is a response to a stalling labor market and slowing economic growth. The decision highlights the central bank's challenge of simultaneously curbing inflation while supporting employment. The move also occurs amid significant political pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for more aggressive rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut is set to have a mixed but tangible impact on household finances across the United States. Borrowers with variable-rate products like credit cards will likely see their interest rates decrease almost immediately, providing some relief from high costs. However, the effect on fixed-rate loans such as mortgages and auto loans will be more gradual, while savers will likely see diminished returns on high-yield savings accounts and CDs. The change offers benefits for borrowers but presents challenges for those relying on interest income.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts project the storm will remain over open waters for several days and does not pose an immediate threat to any land areas. However, meteorologists predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves north of the Caribbean. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been less active than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day by eating fermented fruit. The study provides direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits chimps eat, supporting the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary origins. Scientists clarified that the chimpanzees are exposed to a steady, low dose of alcohol rather than experiencing actual intoxication, which would require binging on large quantities of the fruit.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly refuted claims from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby that the ultra-low-cost carrier business model is dead. Biffle asserted that the U.S. airline industry is currently facing an oversupply issue, not a failing model for discount carriers, and pointed to Frontier's lower unit costs as a key advantage. The public disagreement highlights the intense competition in the domestic market, where legacy airlines have adopted their own no-frills 'basic economy' fares to compete with budget airlines for value-focused travelers.</p>

This approach aims to lure India away from Russia's sphere of influence through deeper trade, defense, and strategic cooperation, contrasting with U.S. pressure for punitive tariffs over India's Russian oil purchases. The strategy highlights India's importance as a counterweight to China and a partner in diversifying global supply chains.

Additionally, persistent inflation and broader market uncertainty are driving investors toward the precious metal as a traditional safe-haven asset, which could push its price to new record highs.
