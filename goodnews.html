        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CNBC article reports on the impact of the temporary tariff cuts between the U.S. and China, particularly on the retail sector. The pause is expected to alleviate potential product shortages for the upcoming Christmas season, as Chinese factories can resume production for U.S. clients. However, some previously imposed tariffs remain in place, and businesses still face added costs for logistics, potentially leading to overall price increases. The article also mentions that while this provides short-term relief, businesses are hopeful for a permanent agreement between the two countries.</p>

          <p>This South China Morning Post article reports on a study that suggests liquid water may be present just a few kilometers beneath the surface of Mars. Using data from NASA's InSight lander, researchers analyzed seismic waves from marsquakes to identify a zone in the planet's crust that could be water-saturated rock. This finding could change our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

The acceleration was driven mainly by a continued oil and gas sector recovery and strong growth in the tech and finance industries. The World Bank expects the rate of growth of Nigeria's economy to slightly increase in 2025 to 3.7%. However, poverty remains high and inflation is expected to remain over 20% through the year.

While gold is seen as a safe haven asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. Central banks have been net buyers of gold, adding to their official reserves, and there has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from Exchange Traded Funds. While some experts believe the upward trend will continue, others are concerned that a market bubble is forming. (not investment advice)</p>
