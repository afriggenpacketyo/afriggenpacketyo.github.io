          <p>Markus S√∂der, a prominent Bavarian political leader, has called for Germany to significantly bolster its national defenses by acquiring a protective shield similar to Israel's 'Iron Dome' system. His proposal includes purchasing 2,000 Patriot missiles, 100,000 drones, and hundreds of new tanks and fighter jets to create a modern, deterrent-capable military. S√∂der emphasized the need to cooperate with nations like Ukraine and Israel to leverage their recent combat experience, reflecting a growing sense of urgency within Germany to adapt its security posture to new geopolitical realities.</p>

          <h2>Partial Lifting of Seafood Ban Raises Questions for China-Japan Relations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's decision to conditionally resume imports of Japanese seafood, excluding ten prefectures like Fukushima, marks a potential shift in the diplomatic standoff over the Fukushima nuclear plant's treated water release. Beijing had implemented a full ban in August 2023, citing safety concerns and escalating tensions with Tokyo. This partial reversal is seen as a cautious step, but its ability to facilitate a broader diplomatic reset remains uncertain. The move comes amid ongoing disputes and strong opposition from Chinese authorities, leaving the future of the trade relationship dependent on further negotiations and trust-building measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has partially lifted its nearly two-year ban on Japanese seafood, which was originally imposed due to concerns over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The ban was a significant economic blow to Japan's fishing industry, as China was its largest export market. While imports from most of Japan can now resume, the prohibition remains for ten prefectures, including Fukushima. Japanese exporters must re-register and provide health and origin certificates, as all shipments will be subject to rigorous testing and compliance checks by Chinese customs authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax just one day before it was set to take effect, following a declaration from U.S. President Donald Trump that he was terminating all trade negotiations. The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to large tech companies like Google and Amazon, drawing strong opposition from the United States. In announcing the reversal, Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade deal and would allow for the resumption of vital economic and security negotiations between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, researchers are examining why they are more prone to inducing motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a key factor. This system, which recovers kinetic energy to charge the battery, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Scientists are now exploring solutions, including auditory cues, to mitigate these effects and improve the passenger experience in the growing EV market.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion and player fatigue. While acknowledging the financial benefits and prestige of the tournament, Guardiola admitted he tries not to think about the demanding schedule to avoid anxiety. His comments echo those of other top managers who have criticized the relentless calendar, highlighting the ongoing tension between football's governing bodies and clubs over player welfare and the integrity of domestic competitions.</p>

In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events. The events highlighted the community's resilience and joy as a form of resistance, while also commemorating the legacy of the Stonewall Riots and the ongoing fight for equality and inclusion worldwide.</p>
