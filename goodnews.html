          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed public reaction to her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which played on the double meaning of "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having racial undertones, while others defended it against "woke" criticism. Sweeney, who has not publicly commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. The article notes that despite the backlash, some PR experts believe the controversy could ultimately boost her career by generating significant publicity.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method for making biological tissues, including the brain, transparent, allowing for the clearest view yet of their internal structures. The technique produces highly accurate and vivid 3D images by preserving the integrity of the organ's morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. According to the scientists, the process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that forms a stable, solid state at low temperatures. This breakthrough could enable more detailed study of complex biological systems and allows for long-term storage of the prepared samples.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive mistakes and poor pitching from their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' struggles began in the first inning when two runners were caught stealing, and their starting pitcher walked the first three batters. A costly dropped fly ball in the second inning allowed two more runs to score, giving the Dodgers an insurmountable early lead. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, which would serve as a tiebreaker if needed.</p>

          <p>This "48 Hours" report provides a detailed account of the investigation that led to the conviction of Bryan Patrick Miller, known as the "Zombie Hunter," for the 1990s Phoenix canal murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. The case went cold for over two decades until genetic genealogy pointed to Miller as a suspect, leading detectives to obtain his DNA through an undercover sting at a restaurant. The trial revealed Miller's violent past, including a juvenile stabbing and other allegations, while his defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to childhood abuse. Miller was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to death.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Propose Hypersonic Drone Carrier with Novel Rotating 'Scissor Wing'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have proposed a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives NASA's "scissor wing" concept from the 1970s. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high efficiency. This innovative approach aims to solve the long-standing aerodynamic challenge of creating an aircraft that performs well at both subsonic and hypersonic speeds.</p>

          <p>This "48 Hours" report details the case against Colorado dentist James Craig, who was accused and later convicted of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, with poison. The investigation began after a suspicious package containing potassium cyanide was delivered to his dental office, prompting his business partner to alert authorities. Prosecutors argued that Craig researched undetectable poisons online and laced his wife's daily protein shakes with arsenic and cyanide, motivated by an affair and significant financial debt. The defense suggested Craig was suicidal, not homicidal, but he was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <h2>A Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Reasons People Have Affairs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, written by a couples' therapist, explores the complex psychological motivations that can lead individuals in committed relationships to have an affair. The author identifies five common triggers, including the pressure of always being "good" and following societal expectations, the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor personal boundaries often developed in childhood. Other significant catalysts include being in an abusive or emotionally neglectful marriage, or experiencing a recent major loss, such as the death of a parent. The piece suggests these factors can create an emotional void or breaking point, making an affair seem like a form of release or self-discovery.</p>

          <p>A small, single-engine plane made a successful emergency landing on the I-805 highway in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon. The pilot was forced to land on the freeway due to apparent mechanical issues shortly after taking off from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The California Highway Patrol reported that no injuries occurred to the pilot or any motorists on the ground. The incident caused a significant traffic disruption, with southbound lanes of the highway closed for several hours while authorities investigated and removed the aircraft. The FAA is investigating the cause of the emergency.</p>
