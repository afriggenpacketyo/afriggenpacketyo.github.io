          <p>President Trump has changed his position on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a 'success' after a meeting, just days after demanding his immediate resignation over alleged conflicts of interest related to China. The meeting, which included the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury, resulted in an agreement for Tan to provide suggestions to the administration. This reversal follows a pattern of the administration's direct involvement in the semiconductor industry, including a recent deal where Nvidia agreed to pay the government a 15% cut of its China sales in exchange for export licenses. Intel's stock rose following the news of the constructive discussion between Trump and its CEO.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, director Martin Scorsese revealed the extreme lengths he considered to protect his 1976 film 'Taxi Driver' from studio-mandated cuts. Concerned that Columbia Pictures would remove the movie's notoriously bloody content, Scorsese contemplated getting a gun to threaten executives and planned to physically steal the film's rough cut to prevent its destruction. Fellow director Steven Spielberg recalled receiving a distressed call from Scorsese about the situation. Ultimately, a compromise was reached where Scorsese desaturated the color in the violent scenes, reducing the vividness of the red blood and allowing the film to be released without cutting the controversial sequences.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu lost a tightly contested match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open, falling in a three-set battle that lasted over three hours. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is being hailed as further proof of her resurgence and ability to challenge top-tier opponents, following a similar strong showing at Wimbledon. The display of resilience and skill suggests a positive trajectory for Raducanu as she heads into the US Open, a tournament she famously won in 2021. Sabalenka praised Raducanu after the match, acknowledging her improvement and return to form after previous struggles with fitness.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue their partnership with Netflix through a new multi-year, first-look deal for their Archewell Productions company. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their projects and covered overhead costs. Under the previous agreement, the couple produced several successful series, including the highly-viewed documentary 'Harry & Meghan.' The new deal will also incorporate Meghan's lifestyle brand, As ever, and continue their work on projects like a second season of her cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood, a few blocks from the Crypto.com Arena. The project, proposed by New York-based Mack Real Estate Development, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 580 vehicles. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for when construction might begin. Urban development experts note that high interest rates, rising material costs due to tariffs, and labor uncertainties are creating a challenging financial climate for new large-scale housing projects, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance, helping the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory over the London Spirit in The Hundred cricket tournament. Baker's opening spell was remarkably economical, conceding only four runs from his first ten deliveries and effectively neutralizing international stars David Warner and Kane Williamson. His efforts, which included the key dismissal of Ashton Turner, earned him player of the match honors and high praise from team captain Phil Salt and England legend James Anderson. Baker's performance highlights his rising talent and why he is considered a promising prospect for English cricket.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced via a Truth Social post that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent ruling by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Following Trump's declaration that 'Gold will not be Tariffed!', gold futures experienced a notable drop, closing 2.48% lower. The initial ruling would have impacted gold bar imports from any country, not just Switzerland, potentially disrupting the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck. The company aims to launch the vehicle within 18 months at a price point around $30,000, which would make it competitive with both existing EVs and traditional gas-powered trucks. This strategy marks a pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, after facing profitability challenges with its larger F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E models. The move is seen as an essential step to compete with Chinese automakers who are already successful in the affordable EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lithium-related stocks experienced a surge on Monday following reports that Chinese battery giant CATL has suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was caused by an expired permit, and the company is working to renew it to resume operations as quickly as possible. This single mine accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecasted for 2025. The unexpected halt in production has led investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to a tighter supply, causing shares of miners like U.S.-based Albemarle to jump significantly.

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, a Certificate of Deposit (CD) can offer a predictable and safe return on savings. This article calculates the potential interest earnings for a $50,000 deposit across various CD terms available today, from short-term to long-term options. For example, a one-year CD at a top rate of 4.40% could earn $2,200, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could yield over $11,000 in interest. The analysis highlights that while CDs lack the high growth potential of the stock market, their fixed rates and FDIC insurance provide a reliable alternative for risk-averse savers.
