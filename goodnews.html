          <p>Members of Parliament are debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, facing scrutiny and amendments. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647. The bill has undergone significant changes, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off on each request, replacing it with a panel of experts. The debate includes amendments to ensure no obligation for medical staff to participate and to prevent doctors from discussing assisted death with under 18s unless the patient initiates the conversation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill, aiming to provide relief to retirees. This "bonus" is designed as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept previously supported by President Trump. The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025-2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. A median income retiree might see their taxes cut by a little less than $500 per year with this change (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Shares of Cartier owner Richemont jumped 7% after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division.

Full-year sales also rose 4%, with Japan leading annual sales growth due to strong domestic and tourist spending and a weak Yen.

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have agreed on a path for Abu Dhabi to purchase advanced American-made semiconductors for its AI development, according to President Trump. The agreement may involve the UAE importing 500,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips per year, accelerating its ability to build data centers for AI models. The Trump administration plans to rescind a Biden-era 'AI diffusion rule,' which imposed strict export controls, though concerns exist that this could allow sensitive technology to reach rivals like China. The White House also announced a partnership with the UAE to build a massive artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article reflects on the Democratic Party's delayed acknowledgment of President Biden's declining condition, suggesting a failure of groupthink and risk aversion. While Biden's inner circle may have obscured the extent of his infirmity, it was evident to many voters, raising questions about why party insiders overlooked it. The author posits that gerontocracy in American politics and a focus on policy achievements within the White House bubble may have contributed to the denial. The article also criticizes the party's lack of decisive action even after Biden's poor debate performance, highlighting a need for more courage and less deference within the Democratic Party.</p>

However, both sides remain reserved, offering few details on forthcoming meetings between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The first round of negotiations in Geneva was seen positively in Beijing, as both sides agreed to temporarily lower duties and establish a 'communication mechanism' on economic and trade issues.

By holding discussions in Geneva, China signaled to the U.S. that resolving global trade concerns requires a multilateral effort involving the World Trade Organization (WTO). The presence of Li Chenggang, China's WTO ambassador, further underscored this message. Although tariffs were slashed, the article suggests that no bilateral deal was truly struck in Geneva, as the cuts were merely an attempt to rectify non-compliant measures with WTO rules.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has declared victory in its recent military clash with India, leading to a resurgence of public confidence in state institutions, particularly the military. Despite analysts viewing the conflict as more of a draw, Pakistan's ability to hold its own against India has temporarily overshadowed its political, economic, and security crises. The military's image has been bolstered, with General Syed Asim Munir portrayed as a 'national savior.' However, this renewed support could diminish if the military is perceived as overreaching in politics or failing to address internal security challenges.</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment. The treatment, delivered via an infusion, corrected a single mutation in his DNA, preventing severe mental and developmental delays. This method offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases, making them more accessible and affordable.
