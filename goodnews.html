          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which encompasses President Trump's legislative agenda, but the Senate is expected to make significant changes. Senate Republicans, while aiming to pass Trump's agenda swiftly, intend to modify the bill, particularly concerning its addition of trillions to the national debt. Some senators are calling for steeper spending cuts, while others express conditional support, acknowledging the need for further work. The Senate's modifications risk complications when the bill returns to the House, with a Fourth of July deadline set for both chambers to pass it.</p>

          <p>Despite a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel, dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi presented his latest feature, "It Was Just an Accident," at the Cannes Film Festival, receiving an eight-minute standing ovation.

Panahi, who was arrested in 2022 and later released, insists on continuing to make films as an act of resistance against censorship, refusing to submit his scripts to the Islamic Guidance Ministry for approval.

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner for top investors in the $TRUMP meme coin, sparking accusations of corruption from protestors and Democrat opponents. The event, advertised as an exclusive invitation, took place as Bitcoin reached a new high. Critics argue that Trump is using his presidency to enrich himself through crypto, while the White House denies any conflicts of interest. Trump's views on cryptocurrency have evolved, now embracing the industry, and his family holds a majority stake in a crypto exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a precedent from a 1970s court case involving a Japanese zipper company. However, the judge transferred the lawsuit challenging Trump's tariffs to the Court of International Trade in New York. This decision marks the first instance of a federal judge indicating that Trump's tariff imposition falls within his presidential authority, potentially signaling a favorable reception at the Court of International Trade.</p>

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues against the extreme criticism aimed at Harvard University, which he terms "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." While acknowledging the university's serious ailments, including erosion of academic freedom and political narrowness, Pinker contends that the invective and punitive measures from the Trump administration are disproportionate. He emphasizes that Harvard, despite its flaws, contributes significantly to knowledge and innovation, and that the appropriate response is to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than dismantle the institution. He also notes that the university has implemented reforms to address concerns about antisemitism and viewpoint diversity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will implement its new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, featuring updated scoring standards emphasizing readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT consists of five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, particularly for soldiers in combat roles, with sex-neutral combat standards. Experts note the AFT is challenging but achievable for individuals with a basic fitness foundation, testing full-body strength, muscular endurance, speed, agility, and cardiovascular stamina.</p>

          <p>A Cooper's hawk in West Orange, New Jersey, has been observed using a pedestrian crosswalk signal to ambush prey. The hawk exploits the rhythmic clicking sound of the signal to anticipate traffic congestion, using the line of cars as cover to approach a residential yard where small birds gather. This ingenious hunting strategy demonstrates the hawk's cognitive abilities, including creating a mental map of the neighborhood and understanding the relationship between the traffic signal and the pileup of cars. This behavior highlights the flexibility and adaptability of animals in human environments.</p>
