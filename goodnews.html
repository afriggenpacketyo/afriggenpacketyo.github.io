          <p>US President Donald Trump and Pakistan have announced a new trade agreement, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's substantial oil reserves. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the US. This development follows the US imposing a 25% tariff on India, Pakistan's rival, for its trade with Russia, which Trump publicly criticized. The agreement suggests a potential shift in regional trade dynamics, with Trump even suggesting Pakistan could someday sell oil to India, highlighting a complex interplay of international relations and economic strategy.</p>

The project, a joint venture with Nscale and Aker, aims to deploy 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by late 2026 and will operate entirely on renewable hydropower. This initiative is part of OpenAI's broader $500 billion global infrastructure expansion, extending its Stargate project from the US and UAE. The move also aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," emphasizing data processing within European borders and leveraging abundant, low-cost renewable energy sources in the region.</p>

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke revealed that Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new Air Borneo, are interested in purchasing China's C919 passenger jet. This interest is driven by growing air travel demand in Southeast Asia and significant delivery backlogs from traditional manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. Airlines are seeking to diversify their aircraft procurement and explore cheaper, faster options offered by Shanghai-based Comac. The minister emphasized that while interest exists, no commercial negotiations have been confirmed yet, indicating a potential shift in the regional aviation market dynamics and a challenge to the established duopoly.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly in September. This move follows similar announcements from France and the United Kingdom, intensifying international pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the recognition is contingent on Palestinian Authority reforms, including elections without Hamas. While Israel and its closest ally, the United States, oppose such recognition, proponents argue it is a crucial step towards achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and promoting self-determination for the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Australia has enacted a pioneering national ban on social media for youth, a measure pitched as a solution to a growing mental health crisis among teenagers. The law, which takes effect in December, imposes substantial fines on platforms like TikTok and Facebook for failing to block underage users, though individuals will not be penalized. While the ban aims to protect young people from cyberbullying and harmful content, some experts question its effectiveness, citing a lack of clear causal links between social media and mental health. Critics also warn it might push young users to less regulated online spaces and emphasize the need for broader mental health system reforms.</p>

Following negotiations, the Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, which will now be permanently displayed in India. This repatriation, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is hailed as a victory for India's cultural heritage and a resolution to the debate over the proper custodianship of such artifacts, ensuring their veneration.</p>

While a deal is preferred, India aims for a "good agreement" by late 2025, signaling its readiness to negotiate on its own terms and diversify its trade relationships, rather than succumbing to pressure.
