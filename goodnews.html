          <p>Japan's Finance Ministry reported a record current account surplus of 30.38 trillion yen ($208 billion) for fiscal year 2024, marking the second consecutive year of record highs. The surplus was driven by substantial returns on foreign investments, with the balance growing 16.1 percent from the previous year. This represents the highest level since comparable data became available in fiscal 1985, highlighting Japan's strong performance in international trade and investment. The surplus indicates Japan's robust financial position and its ability to generate income from overseas assets.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections amidst a growing feud between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte. These elections are viewed as a proxy battle between the two leaders, with results influencing the 2028 presidential election. Voters are casting ballots for over 18,000 positions, including key Senate seats that will determine the fate of Duterte's impeachment trial. Security measures have been heightened due to the country's history of election-related violence, and voters are heading to the polls to shape the nation's political landscape.</p>

          <h2>UK Immigration Trends and Labour's Aim to Buck Them</h2>

          <p>Immigration into the UK has been a significant demographic change of the 21st century, with net migration consistently exceeding emigration since the mid-1990s. Past governments have struggled to meet their immigration targets, despite promises to reduce numbers. Brexit was expected to grant more control over immigration, but net migration figures have remained high. The latest data is anticipated to show a decline in 2024, and Labour is aiming to buck the trend of rising legal migration, addressing what is considered a political failing.</p>
