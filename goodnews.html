          <p>Hilaria Baldwin, a contestant on "Dancing with the Stars," has openly discussed the challenges of living in the public eye with her husband, Alec Baldwin. She admitted that despite the many privileges, the constant scrutiny and diverse public opinions are often difficult to endure, sometimes leading her to moments of private emotional distress. Baldwin, who has previously faced significant public backlash, emphasized that she never fully adjusts to negative commentary but strives to distance herself from it. She expressed deep appreciation for her family's unwavering support, with Alec and their seven children attending her performances and cheering her on, highlighting their commitment amidst a demanding schedule.</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a 2-2 draw against Monaco in the Champions League, despite twice holding a lead, with the final equalizer arriving in the 90th minute via an Eric Dier penalty. Prolific striker Erling Haaland, who netted both of City's goals, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the team's performance, asserting they lacked the energy and quality required for a victory. This outcome highlights a concerning pattern for Manchester City, as they have consistently conceded late goals in recent competitions, costing them valuable points in both the Premier League and the Champions League. While the team remains unbeaten in its last six outings, these defensive vulnerabilities are raising questions about their ability to maintain leads.</p>

          <p>A surprising incident occurred at the grand opening of a new In-N-Out restaurant in Monrovia, California, when a 3- to 4-foot python was discovered in the drive-thru. An employee promptly alerted Pasadena Humane, which dispatched a specialist to safely wrangle the serpent. The non-profit animal welfare group noted the snake appeared well-cared for, weighing 3.6 pounds, and is currently classified as a stray, not available for adoption. Pasadena Humane encourages the public to maintain a safe distance from pythons and to contact them for assistance, as safely taking a photo can help in determining if the snake is domestic or wild.</p>

          <h2>Investors Remain Calm Amid Government Shutdown, Historical Data Shows Modest Market Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors remained largely unfazed by the U.S. government shutdown, with stocks closing at record highs on Wednesday. Analysis of 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 reveals that these closures typically have only a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, particularly if they are brief. Historically, the S&P 500 index has shown an average gain of 0.3% during shutdowns and a significant 13% increase in the 12 months following their conclusion. However, experts caution that a prolonged shutdown could heighten market uncertainty and disrupt the flow of critical economic reports, potentially leading investors to feel "flying blind." This article highlights that while historical trends suggest resilience, current political dynamics introduce an element of unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, in his initial comments on U.S. politics since his election, critically assessed the "pro-life" label, stating that those who oppose abortion but support the death penalty are "not really pro-life." He extended this argument to include the "inhuman treatment of immigrants," reinforcing Catholic Church teachings against capital punishment and advocating for humane migration policies. The Pope's remarks coincided with a debate over Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, who declined an award from Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich due to conservative bishops' objections over Durbin's abortion rights stance. Pope Leo emphasized the importance of mutual respect and a holistic approach to ethical issues within the Church, urging a deeper examination of all life-related concerns.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion in the boiler room of a New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx caused a partial collapse of a 20-story high-rise, with extensive damage visible along Alexander Avenue. Initial assessments indicate the blast traveled up the chimney, leading to the structural failure. Remarkably, Mayor Eric Adams and other officials confirmed that no injuries or fatalities were reported, averting a major disaster. Residents from affected apartments were evacuated, and gas services for the entire complex were shut off as authorities initiated comprehensive inspections to assess the building's structural integrity. This incident occurred despite the building having active violations for unsafe facades dating back to 2020.</p>

This revival is notably spurred by recent events, such as Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension following comments made after Charlie Kirk's assassination, and subsequent criticism from President Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr.

This direction, described as a "nudge toward the future" rather than a complete overhaul, aims to appeal to younger audiences. The article notes the inclusion of performers like Jeremy Culhane and Veronika Slowikowska, known for short-form online comedy, and also Kam Patterson, whose rise through the Austin comedy scene has been linked to polarizing right-wing personalities, marking a potential change in Michaels' recruitment approach.</p>

Through education and intervention, without vaccines or medication, the Carter Center's program dramatically reduced cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to a provisional count of four by September 2025.

          <p>Major automakers, including General Motors, Ford, and Hyundai, experienced robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely propelled by record electric vehicle (EV) sales. Consumers accelerated their EV purchases to capitalize on $7,500 federal incentives before their expiration. GM and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in overall sales year-over-year, with GM's EV sales more than doubling and Ford's rising by 30%. Hyundai also saw a 13% sales increase, driven by a doubling of its all-electric vehicle sales. Despite the cessation of these federal tax credits, some manufacturers, such as Hyundai, are proactively implementing price reductions and offering new cash incentives to sustain EV sales momentum, noting the incentives ended as part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."
