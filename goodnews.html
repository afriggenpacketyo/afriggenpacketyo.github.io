          <p>A distinct group of individuals known as "SuperAgers" are providing new insights into healthy aging and dementia prevention. These individuals, aged 80 and older, possess the memory capabilities of people decades younger, and their brains shrink at a slower rate than their peers. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been studying this group for over two decades to uncover the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to their remarkable cognitive resilience. The findings aim to help develop strategies to protect against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss Smartphone Addiction and the Trend of 'Dumbphones'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 03:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pervasive nature of smartphones is prompting a re-evaluation of our relationship with technology, as many users feel they spend too much time on their devices. Studies show that the mere proximity of a smartphone can diminish cognitive capacity, even when it is silent. This has led to a growing interest in less-addictive "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys, particularly among younger, digitally native generations. Experts suggest that managing phone use is less about willpower and more about intentionally creating moments of real-world connection to interrupt addictive habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The space sector is experiencing a renewed interest in traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), moving away from the SPAC merger trend that was popular in recent years. Companies like Firefly Aerospace have recently gone public, achieving high valuations and signaling strong investor confidence in the sector's long-term strategic potential. Analysts note that while geopolitical volatility presents risks, space companies often benefit from government contracts, insulating them from some market pressures. This trend is supported by a surge in private investment in space startups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide injunction blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship. This is the fourth court decision to halt the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration argues the amendment's citizenship clause does not apply in these cases.</p>
