          <p>In an exclusive interview, Backstreet Boys member AJ McLean opened up about his long struggle with drug and alcohol addiction and his journey toward sobriety. Nearing four years sober, McLean describes himself as a former "chronic relapser" but now feels he doesn't have another relapse in him, crediting his recovery to continuous work and staying present. He emphasizes the importance of being brutally honest with his daughters about his past to control the narrative and explains how he learned to separate his identity from his stage persona, finding a new, empowering confidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is intensifying its "de-risking" strategy from China by developing plans to regain control over key industrial sectors and reduce dependency on Chinese supply chains. These efforts include implementing tighter trade defenses, encouraging the reshoring of industries, and diversifying supply sources for critical materials where China currently holds a near-monopoly. This reflects a broader geopolitical agenda within the EU to enhance its economic resilience and treat industrial policy as a crucial tool for maintaining strategic autonomy in a challenging global environment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following years of patient testimonials on social media about the severe pain of IUD insertions, the medical establishment is updating its guidelines for pain management. Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommend offering local anesthetics, a significant shift from previously suggesting only over-the-counter painkillers. This change reflects a broader movement toward patient-centered care and taking women's pain more seriously, addressing historical biases in gynecology. The article explores various pain relief options, from nitrous oxide to paracervical blocks, and emphasizes the importance of open doctor-patient communication.</p>

          <p>In a significant rescue operation, 31 workers trapped underground following a tunnel collapse in Los Angeles were all brought to safety without any injuries. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter tunnel being constructed for a municipal wastewater project, with the collapse happening several miles from the access point. The workers managed to climb over a large pile of debris to meet rescuers before being shuttled out. Los Angeles Fire Department officials and Mayor Karen Bass expressed immense relief, calling the successful outcome a great blessing for the city.</p>

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a "zonal pricing" system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographical location. Instead, it will pursue reforms to the existing national pricing system, where everyone pays the same rate. Proponents of zonal pricing, like Octopus Energy, argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland and encourage industry relocation. However, some major energy firms warned the change could deter investment, and the industry has largely welcomed the government's decision to maintain a stable, national framework.</p>

          <p>To encourage exploration of lesser-known areas, the Faroe Islands' tourism board has launched 30 self-guided driving tours with a unique twist: the destinations are kept secret. Travelers access the itineraries on their phones, but each stop is only revealed as they progress, ensuring a sense of unpredictability and preventing overcrowding at popular sites. The goal of the "Auto Odyssey" initiative is to guide visitors to small villages, unique restaurants, and scenic lookouts, offering an authentic experience of the archipelago's dramatic landscapes while managing tourist flow and preserving the sense of solitude.</p>

          <p>The UK and French governments are reportedly close to finalizing a new deal aimed at deterring small boat crossings of the English Channel. The agreement would see France take back a certain number of migrants who have crossed, while the UK would accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers from France with legitimate claims. While the initial pilot scheme is expected to be limited in scale, it marks a significant diplomatic shift with France's willingness to accept returns. The ultimate test of the deal's success will be whether it serves as an effective deterrent and leads to a fall in crossing numbers.</p>

          <p>In what researchers are calling a major leap for autonomous surgery, a robot has successfully performed a realistic gallbladder removal with 100% accuracy. The system, developed by Johns Hopkins University, was trained on surgical videos and demonstrated the ability to operate with the skill of a human surgeon, even adapting to unexpected events and voice commands. Unlike previous tests that required controlled environments, this new system uses machine learning to understand surgical procedures and adapt to a patient's anatomy in real-time, bringing autonomous robotic surgery closer to clinical viability.</p>

The analysis points to China's low inflation, large foreign reserves, and the government's commitment to stability as key advantages for the currency. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan, especially as confidence in the US dollar is challenged by American debt and protectionist trade policies.

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a benchmark for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which accounts for 43% of all units in the city. This system, which includes both municipally owned and limited-profit housing, caters to a wide range of incomes and keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market. Financed in part by a levy on employee salaries, Vienna's long-term political commitment to non-market housing has prevented the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities, ensuring greater affordability and stability for its residents.</p>
