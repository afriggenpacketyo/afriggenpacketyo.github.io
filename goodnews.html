          <p>Pfizer has raised its adjusted profit guidance for the full year, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by sales of its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. Consequently, the company now projects a full-year adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This updated outlook also considers potential impacts from the Trump administration's efforts to lower drug prices and impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, demonstrating the company's confidence amidst regulatory pressures.</p>

The company's quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time, a 48% increase year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence platforms. CEO Alex Karp described the results as a "once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter," highlighting substantial growth in both its U.S. commercial and government sectors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup report reveals that Gen Z workers are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work, with only 23% preferring it. Instead, a significant 71% of Gen Z employees favor a hybrid model, expressing a desire for in-person connection, mentorship, and a clearer understanding of their role within their organization. The findings suggest that younger employees feel their career development is compromised in a completely virtual setting. Experts attribute this preference to the importance of spontaneous interactions for learning and a need to combat loneliness, which is more prevalent among younger workers.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant offer for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, with the total package valued at a potential €85 million (£73.8m). The bid includes a guaranteed payment of €75 million for the 22-year-old Slovenian international. United is said to believe this is a fair valuation and that the player is interested in a move to the Premier League club. The club is reportedly willing to part with Rasmus Hojlund to accommodate the new striker, though they face competition from Newcastle for Sesko's signature.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs present a relatively affordable borrowing method in the current high-interest-rate environment. As of early August 2025, average rates for these products are in the low-to-mid 8% range, substantially lower than typical personal loan or credit card rates. A home equity loan provides a lump sum at a fixed rate, while a HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit. While these loans offer potential tax benefits if used for home improvements, homeowners must be cautious as their property serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a challenging market with high rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still find viable options. As of early August 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are just under 7%, while 15-year loans are closer to 6%. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers. To secure the best possible rates, individuals should focus on strengthening their credit profile, as top-tier scores often lead to more favorable loan terms. It is also crucial to compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most suitable and affordable loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular investment, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during times of economic uncertainty. As of early August 2025, the price of gold stood at approximately $3,376 per ounce. The value of this precious metal is subject to constant change, influenced by a variety of factors including global supply and demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical instability.

          <p>Amid shifting global power dynamics, the trilateral forum of Russia, India, and China (RIC) is experiencing a revival of diplomatic interest as a potential stabilizing force in Asia. For Russia, isolated by the West, reviving the RIC offers a platform to counter its isolation and balance its growing dependency on China. Beijing sees the forum as a way to stabilize its continental flank with India, with which relations remain tense. While New Delhi remains cautious, the renewed focus on the RIC reflects a pragmatic approach by all three nations to navigate a multipolar world and manage regional stability.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in public health over the past decades, significantly improving life expectancy and child health despite being a lower-middle-income country. However, with the recent resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the formation of an interim government, there are concerns that this progress could be at risk. Health experts are calling on global organizations like the WHO and World Bank to provide urgent support to ensure the country's health system remains stable during this critical political transition.

The deal, aimed at creating a comprehensive cybersecurity platform, has been met with analyst downgrades and a 16% drop in the company's stock price. Arora defends the move as a strategic bet on emerging AI-related security trends, particularly in identity and access management. Despite the market's hesitation, the acquisition positions Palo Alto to compete more directly with giants like Microsoft and other major players in the rapidly consolidating cybersecurity industry.</p>
