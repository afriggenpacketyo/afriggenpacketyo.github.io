          <h2>UK Government Overhauls Compensation Scheme for Infected Blood Scandal Victims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 23:43:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant changes to the compensation program for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people in the 1970s-90s. The move follows a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the scheme's previous pace as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before their claim is settled, a policy shift costing an additional £1 billion. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the changes, they noted that some key issues still require further consultation.</p>

          <p>The UK government has signed a memorandum of understanding with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to explore the use of artificial intelligence in public services like education, defence, and the justice system. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stated that AI will be fundamental to driving change and economic growth in the UK. The agreement includes plans for an information-sharing program and the development of safeguards to protect public interest and democratic values. The deal has faced some criticism from campaigners concerned about the unlicensed use of data and potential for misinformation.</p>

          <p>"South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have reached a major new deal with Paramount, valuing the global streaming rights for the animated series at $1.5 billion over five years. This agreement will bring the show's full catalog to the Paramount+ streaming service in the United States for the first time. The deal, valued at $300 million annually, solidifies the show's status as one of television's most valuable franchises. The negotiations were reportedly motivated by the desire to secure an agreement before the start of the show's 27th season and a major fan event.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, had to perform a sudden "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar at that airport, had not warned them of the bomber. The B-52, which was participating in a local flyover, was on a converging course at a much higher speed. The Air Force and the FAA are now investigating the incident to determine why the commercial flight was not advised of the military aircraft's presence.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Push Nations to Dismantle Their Own Trade Barriers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they have a potential silver lining. The author suggests the tariffs expose the hypocrisy of countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the EU, which have their own self-defeating internal trade barriers that hinder their economies. The pressure from US tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movement toward removing these domestic barriers, particularly in Canada and China. The article posits that this push for internal economic liberalization could ultimately be a positive, albeit unintentional, consequence of the administration's protectionist policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's largest music conglomerate, has filed for a secondary listing of its shares on a U.S. stock market. The company, which represents top artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, and Billie Eilish, is already listed in the Netherlands with a market valuation of nearly €50 billion. The move to list in the U.S. follows a push from major investors, like Bill Ackman's hedge fund, who believe a U.S. listing will increase the company's value and improve trading liquidity. UMG filed confidentially with the SEC, so the size and timing of the offering are not yet public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas officials have accounted for the vast majority of over 160 people who were initially reported missing after the deadly July Fourth floods along the Guadalupe River. The Kerr County Judge stated that most of the missing were tourists who had returned home without checking in, and only three individuals remain unaccounted for. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, a popular tourist area. The sharp revision in the number of missing persons is a common occurrence in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters as authorities work to verify initial reports.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel has provided an update on his health two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer said he feels "good" but is still working on his balance, which is a common symptom of the condition. NPH, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, forced Joel to cancel a series of concerts in May after doctors advised his condition was exacerbated by performing. He is currently undergoing physical therapy and remains committed to prioritizing his health.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—which he has dubbed "PARC." He suggests these companies are being relentlessly pushed higher by enthusiastic retail investors and are emblematic of a two-track market that operates separately from the S&P 500. Cramer notes that while these trendy stocks can be volatile, they have solid earnings and analyst attention, suggesting their run may continue. He advises investors to be disciplined and take profits when they achieve significant gains in these popular but risky names. (not investment advice)</p>
