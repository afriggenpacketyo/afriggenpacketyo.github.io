        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of people reported missing in Kerr County, Texas, after severe flooding has been drastically reduced from nearly 100 to only three. Officials credit the significant drop to intensive follow-up investigations by state and local agencies, which successfully located and confirmed the safety of most individuals who were previously unaccounted for. The devastating July 4 floods resulted in a statewide death toll of 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals who plan mass attacks but do not have a clear ideological motive that would classify them as terrorists. This legislative change, inspired by recent attacks like the one in Southport, aims to close a legal loophole. It will grant police powers to arrest and charge suspects for preparatory acts, such as researching a target, mirroring the powers that currently exist for counter-terrorism investigations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing debate in the United Kingdom is exploring the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break, with holidays redistributed throughout the year, could help mitigate student learning loss, alleviate holiday hunger, and reduce the financial strain of childcare and travel for parents. However, the proposal remains divisive, facing opposition from many teachers and raising questions about its potential impact on holiday prices and family schedules.</p>

These venues provide a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere compared to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which are often inaccessible due to long waiting lists and a focus on old-money lineage. While still highly exclusive, these new clubs prioritize personal achievement over pedigree, reflecting India's changing economic and social dynamics.</p>

The pledge is part of a broader plan to reform the water sector, which will also include a ban on plastic-containing wet wipes and measures to reduce phosphorus pollution. (not investment advice)</p>
