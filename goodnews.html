          <p>Intel's stock value has surged over 50% in the last month, significantly increasing the value of the U.S. government's stake in the company to approximately $16 billion. This investment was part of a Trump administration deal funded by grants from the CHIPS and Science Act. The chipmaker's recovery is also supported by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and early talks to add AMD as a customer, restoring investor confidence after a difficult fiscal year. These developments have pushed Intel's shares to their highest level in 18 months, signaling a strong rebound for the vital U.S. manufacturer. (not investment advice)</p>

The positive outlook comes ahead of a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in South Korea. Bessent's comments suggest significant progress is being made to resolve ongoing tariff disputes as an extended trade war ceasefire approaches its November deadline. The discussions aim to de-escalate the economic tensions that have seen both nations impose substantial levies on each other's goods. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments on a $90,000 home equity loan have become more affordable for homeowners. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $1,108 per month, while a 15-year term at 8.21% would be around $871 monthly. These figures represent a modest decrease compared to costs earlier in the year and one year ago, reflecting the cooling interest rate environment. The article advises homeowners to weigh these costs against options like a HELOC, which may offer even lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock is on track for its sixth consecutive day of gains, reaching a new record high and trading above $190 per share for the first time. This surge contributes to broader strength in the semiconductor sector. Meanwhile, asset management giant BlackRock also saw its shares rise after Bank of America reiterated a buy rating and significantly raised its price target, citing expectations of a substantial increase in net flows for the third quarter. The positive outlook for BlackRock is driven by growth in fixed income, equity, and alternative asset businesses, positioning it well within the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge and identify the object, which could provide definitive proof for the theory that Earhart landed and was marooned on the island. A successful identification would be a monumental discovery in one of history's most enduring aviation mysteries.</p>

Bowden, 29, was one of over 100 crew members who died aboard the USS California. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. Using modern DNA analysis, dental records, and anthropological evidence, the DPAA successfully made the identification and notified Bowden's surviving family, bringing long-awaited closure more than eight decades after his death.</p>

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates since the beginning of the year has made large home loans more affordable, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.34%. For a $700,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month than it would have been at January's average rate of 6.93%. Over the full 30-year term, this difference could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. The article also explores refinancing options for current homeowners with higher rates, highlighting the potential for substantial savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, surged over 20% after it announced a new pricing model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could let lenders bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, potentially eliminating mark-ups and reducing costs. The move is seen as a significant shake-up in the credit score industry, giving lenders more choice and control over pricing. Consequently, shares of the major credit bureaus fell as investors anticipated a potential disruption to their business models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. The sales boost was partially driven by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. Despite the year-over-year growth, the company's production numbers saw a slight decline, and its stock dipped following the report. The results reflect a mixed quarter for Tesla, which has faced a sales slump in Europe but benefited from short-term incentives in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>
