          <h2>Art World Mourns the Loss of Visionary Curator Koyo Kouoh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:40:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the slated curator of the 2026 Venice Biennale, has died at age 57 in Switzerland, just before announcing the event's theme. As the executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, she championed artists of color from Africa and beyond, revitalizing the museum and changing its relationship with the local community. Kouoh curated acclaimed shows, including a Tracey Rose retrospective and 'When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting,' and she was known for her sophisticated curatorial approach that blended aesthetic, art historical, painterly, and political elements. Kouoh's career was marked by a commitment to bringing African artists to the forefront, and her passing leaves a significant void in the contemporary art landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The new rules will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country, aiming to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers coming to the UK over the next year. The government will also increase the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and introduce stricter requirements for training commitments to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the UK labor market, and the government plans to introduce a fair pay agreement for care workers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness for adverse events, ranging from assembling bug-out bags to storing potable water. This behavior is deeply rooted in American identity, stemming from a historical emphasis on self-sufficiency and frontier survival. The article discusses how this trend has been fueled by extreme weather events and a perceived inadequacy of government response, leading individuals to take responsibility for their own safety through consumption choices. The ultra-wealthy's elaborate preparation plans, such as building private islands and bunkers, are also examined as a form of conspicuous consumption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with the challenges of parenthood and a lack of structural support for families in America, some parents are choosing to build family life around friends, creating a village of their own for support. This involves co-housing, living near friends, or sharing homes to create extended family-like networks. These arrangements offer benefits such as shared child care, emotional support, and deeper friendships, but also come with challenges like differing parenting styles and a need for clear communication and coordination. While not seamless, these relationships can transform family life, offering much-needed support and a sense of community.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with Donald Trump's administration. While not explicitly mentioned in the initial announcement, the UK businesses secretary indicated that the wider aerospace industry would have a specific guarantee of zero tariffs. This deal would provide certainty to a ¬£40 billion sector supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK and would also benefit US companies like Boeing that import Rolls-Royce engines.</p>
