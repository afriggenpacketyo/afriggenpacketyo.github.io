          <h2>Japan Considers Doubling Rice Stockpile Release to Curb Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 03:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating releasing roughly double its stockpiled rice, totaling about 600,000 tons, to address soaring rice prices. This action follows previous auctions earlier in the year, and the government intends to release 300,000 tons over three months through July. This significant release could reduce the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests. The government is also considering relaxing the buyback requirement for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions, as the current rule discourages participation due to fears of potential rice shortages.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the strength of the UK economy compared to other major economies, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized rising employer taxes. Analysts cautioned that the strong growth rate may not be sustainable, especially considering upcoming import tariffs and increased employer taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that spending time in nature can help with recovery from physical injury, citing the experience of Sarah Allely, who found relief from brain injury symptoms through walks in nature. Research indicates that nature can give the brain a break from fast-paced life, reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Holli-Anne Passmore explains that softer attention in nature requires fewer mental resources, allowing the brain to restore, and emotions have an incredible impact on physical wellbeing. The article emphasizes the benefits of deliberate observation of nature in everyday life for improving overall wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to be a significant factor. The IMF noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, thanks to a merchanting and processing system. Danish drugmakers rely on intellectual property, contracting manufacturers in other countries, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. The IMF projects medium-term growth around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>
