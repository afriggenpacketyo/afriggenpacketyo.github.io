          <p>As China imposes rare earth export restrictions, the US and its allies are increasingly focused on building an industrial chain outside of China. USA Rare Earth is working to establish magnet-making and separation technology plants in the US. The company anticipates generating up to $800 million in annual revenue from clients eager for components used in electronics, electric vehicles, and robotics. This effort aims to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals. This push highlights the ongoing trade tensions and the strategic importance of rare earth elements.</p>

          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, including shifting production of two Mexican-produced vehicles to the U.S. This move comes amid President Trump's implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts from Mexico. The investment will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox to U.S. plants and convert an idled Michigan plant to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks in 2027. The changes are seen as a potential win for Trump's policies. The investment will enable GM to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Drug deaths among young people in the U.S. are declining at an unprecedented rate, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. Over the past decade, fentanyl and other street drugs have claimed the lives of more than 230,000 individuals under the age of 35. New federal data indicates a significant decrease in these deaths. The article explores the factors driving this positive trend and the potential impact of federal funding cuts on its continuation. The development offers a glimmer of hope in the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Stock Rallies on Robotaxi Hopes Despite Musk-Trump Feud</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 18:14:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock has recovered significantly after a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump. The rebound is attributed to Musk's announcement of Tesla testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas. The eight-second clip showed the latest version of the Model Y SUV, painted black with a white "Robotaxi" graffiti-style logo painted on it, navigating an intersection and pausing to allow pedestrians to traverse a crosswalk. Tesla is expected to launch a driverless ride-hailing service pilot in Austin in June, using a small fleet of Model Y vehicles with remote monitoring. The article discusses the potential of Tesla's autonomous driving technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nintendo Switch 2: A Refinement, Not Reinvention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 17:52:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, is a worthy successor to the original, focusing on refinement rather than reinvention. It features improved graphics, enhanced controllers with mouse capabilities, and optional chat features with a camera. The screen is 1080p with support for 4K TVs, making older games look brighter and crisper. While battery life may be a challenge, the console's magnetic Joy-Cons and overall feel are significant upgrades. One of the main launch titles is "Mario Kart World," and there's also "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour," a collection of mini-games to show off the console's features.</p>
