          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports. President Trump stated the agreement includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. The deal, which lowers auto tariffs from 25% to 15%, has been met with relief by economists and caused a surge in Japanese auto stocks. This agreement could also provide a political boost to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:26:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement lowers the U.S. tariff on imported Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, providing much-needed relief to Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy. The market's strong positive reaction reflects the easing of concerns over the steep tariffs that had negatively impacted Japanese auto exports in recent months. This development is seen as a major short-term boost for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list due to elbow inflammation, though the team is hopeful he can return this season. Scott exited a recent game after feeling a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, prompting an MRI. While the loss of Scott is a blow to the team's bullpen, which has already faced numerous injuries, initial reports suggest the issue may not be season-ending. His injury underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>Much like the impactful substitutes in their Euro 2022 victory, England's journey to the 2025 final has been significantly boosted by a new "super sub" duo: Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang.

Kelly, who provided a key assist in the quarter-final, scored the dramatic extra-time winner against Italy to secure their place in the final.

          <p>A 250-year-old shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied history. Originally the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology and archival research, driven by a strong community effort from the island's residents. The discovery provides a tangible link to the island's rich maritime past and the history of 18th-century global conflict and commerce.</p>
