          <p>A video circulating online shows French First Lady Brigitte Macron seemingly pushing President Emmanuel Macron as they were about to disembark their plane in Hanoi, Vietnam. The incident sparked various reactions, with Macron clarifying that it was merely a playful moment between him and his wife. Macron told reporters that the couple were simply joking around, adding that the incident was being overblown into "a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe." His office downplayed the interaction as a moment of complicity and playful teasing after a long trip.</p>

Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 helped England set a competitive total, though she later suffered a hamstring injury. The teams will now compete in a three-match one-day international series.</p>
