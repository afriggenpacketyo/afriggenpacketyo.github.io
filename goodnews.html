          <p>A new US-led peace plan for Gaza proposes an international "Board of Peace" to oversee the territory's transitional governance, chaired by President Donald Trump. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is the first named member of this board, which would supervise a technocratic Palestinian committee responsible for daily administration. The 20-point plan aims to end the conflict by demilitarizing Gaza and securing the return of all hostages. Blair has endorsed the proposal as the best opportunity to end the war while ensuring Israel's security.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his cabinet are meeting for a two-day retreat in Berlin to reset their agenda after a challenging first five months in office. The talks will focus on improving Germany's economic competitiveness by cutting bureaucracy costs by 25% and reducing federal staff levels by 8%. This meeting comes as public satisfaction with the ruling conservative-Social Democrat coalition has fallen to a record low. The government aims to adopt a modernization agenda to address pressing economic concerns and rebuild team spirit within the coalition.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has definitively ruled out imposing a Value Added Tax (VAT) on private healthcare services in the upcoming budget. His statement comes amid speculation that Chancellor Rachel Reeves might consider tax increases to manage public finances, as she has warned of difficult economic choices ahead. While Labour's manifesto pledged not to raise VAT, income tax, or National Insurance, pressure from weak economic growth and high borrowing costs has fueled debate. Proponents of the tax suggested it could raise over £2 billion for the NHS.</p>

The case involves the seizure of 61,000 bitcoins, valued at over £5 billion, believed to be the world's largest crypto seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian defrauded over 128,000 victims in China and laundered the proceeds by fleeing to the UK and attempting to buy property. The conviction follows a seven-year investigation by London's Metropolitan Police into the global money laundering operation.</p>

          <p>The US has unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which includes a pathway to a potential Palestinian state. Key provisions demand the release of all hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the complete disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of a transitional government. This new governing body would operate under an international authority, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly involved. The plan, presented to Hamas by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, has been publicly supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Tuesday, influenced by key economic data from China and Australia. China's official manufacturing PMI came in at 49.8, indicating a sixth consecutive month of contraction, though this was better than market forecasts. Meanwhile, Australia's central bank held its benchmark interest rate steady at 3.6% as inflation remains a concern. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose, buoyed by the strong debut of Zijin Gold, while markets in Japan and South Korea saw modest losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister is set to announce the launch of an online NHS hospital service in England, scheduled to be phased in from 2027. The digital service, accessible via the NHS app, will feature its own dedicated doctors to conduct online assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments. The initiative aims to modernize the health service and is projected to deliver up to 8.5 million appointments in its first three years. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the service will focus on conditions that may not require inpatient treatment, freeing up capacity for face-to-face care.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, citing ongoing concerns about inflation, which is at its highest level in over a year. The decision was widely expected by economists and follows a report showing the headline inflation rate reached 3% in August. In its statement, the RBA noted that inflation in the September quarter might be higher than previously forecast and signaled that private demand was recovering. The bank has cut rates by 75 basis points this year to combat rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.8 in September, marking the sixth straight month of contraction but exceeding economists' expectations. The reading, the strongest since March, suggests that Beijing's efforts to curb industrial overcapacity may be having an effect amid weak domestic and global demand. A separate private survey from RatingDog painted a more optimistic picture, showing expansion at 51.2, driven by a rise in new orders. Despite the slight improvement, the data underscores ongoing economic challenges for the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the discount models of European chains like Aldi and Lidl. Amid an economic slowdown, these companies are streamlining their hypermarkets and heavily promoting their own private-label brands to appeal to frugal shoppers. This strategy involves offering products of comparable quality to name brands at lower prices by cutting out intermediaries and reducing marketing costs. The shift comes as sales at top Chinese grocery operators have stagnated and consumer behavior becomes more value-driven.</p>
