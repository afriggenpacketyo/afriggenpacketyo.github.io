          <h2>Guide to Federal Student Loan Borrowing Limits for Higher Education</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 14:32:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college costs continue to rise, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have specific borrowing caps. This article details the annual and lifetime limits for federal student loans, which vary based on factors like dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. These limits often do not cover the full cost of attendance, particularly at private universities, creating a funding gap that students may need to fill with other options like private loans. The article advises exhausting federal options first due to their favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share amid economic headwinds by focusing on value, according to CEO Russell Weiner. The company reported strong U.S. same-store sales growth, attributing its success to popular deals and new products like stuffed crust pizza, which have resonated with customers across all income levels. While competitors struggle with sluggish traffic, Domino's believes its strategy of offering value on desired items gives it a competitive edge in luring diners away from both rivals and eating at home. The company's earnings, however, were impacted by a charge related to its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Senator Omar Fateh, a Democratic socialist, has secured the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party's endorsement for Minneapolis mayor, defeating incumbent Jacob Frey. This victory signals growing momentum for the progressive left in the city's politics. Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the state senate, campaigned on a platform of affordability and building a more inclusive city. Mayor Frey's campaign is contesting the endorsement, alleging a flawed electronic voting process, and plans to appeal while continuing his campaign for the November election.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's loan move from Manchester United to Barcelona marks the end of a long and complex chapter for the 27-year-old forward at his boyhood club. The article explores the reasons behind the exit, citing a decline in form and a breakdown in his relationship with the club and new manager Ruben Amorim. While the deal is seen as a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for Barcelona, it leaves many unanswered questions about how the situation at United deteriorated so significantly for a once-celebrated academy graduate. The move is viewed by many as a necessary change for Rashford to reignite his career.</p>

The author highlights their unequivocal agreement that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination constitutes antisemitism. The article contends that this recognition helps protect Jewish students from discrimination and shifts campus debates from Israel's right to exist to its specific policies.

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder affecting women. Patients and researchers report that the drugs, known for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity, also help alleviate PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and hormonal imbalances. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, the metabolic improvements from GLP-1s appear to indirectly address its root causes. However, more extensive research and challenges with insurance coverage remain significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike strategies that simply buy and hold the asset, this company plans to focus on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's operations. The company's chairman, Andrew Keys, argues that this makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin and that existing ether ETFs do not offer this yield-generating capability. The move reflects growing institutional interest in ether and tokenization. (not investment advice)</p>
