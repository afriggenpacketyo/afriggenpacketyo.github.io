          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination lawsuit, rejecting a lower court's requirement for members of majority groups to meet a higher standard in such cases. The justices overturned an appeals court ruling that had imposed a stricter burden of proof on plaintiffs who are not members of a minority group. This decision clarifies the legal standards for employment discrimination claims and ensures that all individuals, regardless of their background, have equal protection under the law. The ruling emphasizes the importance of fair treatment and equal opportunity in the workplace. </p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban affecting nationals from 19 countries, which experts say addresses legal pitfalls that plagued his previous attempt. The new ban, which is set to take effect on June 9, is wider in scope and has clearly defined exemptions, making it more legally robust. Unlike the original ban, the new restrictions do not explicitly target Muslim-majority states. Legal experts suggest that the changes make the new ban more likely to withstand legal challenges and gain approval from the Supreme Court. </p>
