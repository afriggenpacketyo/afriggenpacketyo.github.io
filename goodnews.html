          <p>The Science and Technology Secretary has called on the police to "do their bit" and embrace change amidst ongoing negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury regarding the upcoming Spending Review. Peter Kyle emphasized that all sectors of society are facing financial pressures, with the Chancellor receiving requests for increased funding from various areas, including schools and scientific research. While Kyle assured increased spending for education and research, he stopped short of guaranteeing policing would be spared from budget constraints. The shadow home secretary expressed concerns over potential police force reductions, urging the government to safeguard their budget, highlighting the tension between financial realities and public safety concerns. The article reflects the government's push for modernization and efficiency within public services while managing budgetary constraints. Optimism score is based on the fact that it reflects a call for adaptation rather than outright crisis.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how China's perception of the threat of American subversion through "peaceful evolution" has diminished under the Trump administration. The author, reflecting on their education in China during the 1960s, recalls being taught to be wary of American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party by promoting Western values and inciting dissent. Mao Zedong's warnings about this threat were a constant theme in classrooms and propaganda. However, the author notes that the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts, leading China to view the threat of peaceful evolution as less potent. The article provides insight into the historical context of US-China relations and how changing US policies have altered China's threat perception.</p>
