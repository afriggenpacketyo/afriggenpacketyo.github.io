          <p>Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold has been dropped from the latest England squad selected by manager Thomas Tuchel for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. The decision follows his recent move from Liverpool and being left out of Real Madrid's starting lineup. In his place, the squad includes first-time call-ups for Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Tottenham's Djed Spence. Marcus Rashford and Adam Wharton have been recalled, while key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka are unavailable due to injury.</p>

          <p>Starting in January, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children, a move that brings the country in line with others like the U.S. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work. The decision follows a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and aims to boost overall public health by drastically reducing chickenpox cases.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning his initial investment in Twitter (now X). The SEC alleges that Musk failed to disclose his growing stake in the company within the required 10-day timeframe, allowing him to purchase additional shares at artificially low prices. Musk's lawyers argue the lawsuit is a "waste of taxpayer resources," claiming the late filing was an error that was immediately corrected and caused no investor harm. They also accused the agency of selectively targeting Musk due to his criticism of government overreach.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its first fiscal quarter, driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division and growth in its e-commerce business. The company's profit was significantly boosted by gains from equity investments and the sale of its Turkish unit, Trendyol. The cloud division's growth was fueled by strong demand for AI-related products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. Despite intense competition and heavy investment in "instant commerce," which impacted e-commerce profitability, the overall results have been positively received by investors.

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%. The strong performance was driven by robust activity in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. This GDP figure represents an acceleration from the 7.4% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The result supports projections from the World Bank and IMF, which estimate India's economy will grow between 6.3% and 6.4% for the full fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a conference in Hong Kong, Eric Trump expressed his strong belief in cryptocurrency, predicting that Bitcoin's value could reach $1 million in the coming years. This appearance is part of a broader push by him and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., to expand their crypto-related business ventures, such as American Bitcoin, into Asia. The tour comes as President Trump has increasingly embraced the digital asset industry, branding himself the "crypto president." However, the visit has also faced political headwinds, with a Hong Kong official and lawmaker reportedly withdrawing from the event. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Why You May Be Waking Up Too Early and How to Address It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consistently waking up much earlier than desired and being unable to fall back asleep is a form of insomnia known as early morning awakening. This condition becomes more common with age due to natural shifts in circadian rhythms, declining melatonin production, and hormonal changes associated with menopause. Other significant factors include mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, as well as evening alcohol consumption, which disrupts sleep in the later part of the night. Sleep specialists recommend addressing the root cause, improving sleep hygiene with consistent schedules, and consulting a doctor or therapist if the problem persists.</p>

          <p>Dorothy Virginia Driggers Taquino, an 81-year-old woman who died during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has finally been identified nearly two decades after the storm. Her identification was made possible after a local New Orleans news outlet investigated the cases of the remaining unidentified victims. Taquino was found in her flooded home but could not be positively identified in the storm's chaotic aftermath and was buried in an unmarked grave. Her family can now move her remains to a family plot, providing a long-awaited sense of closure on the 20th anniversary of the disaster.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from Peking University and City University of Hong Kong has unveiled a prototype for what they describe as a "universal" 6G chip. The new technology is designed to operate across a wide spectrum of frequencies, potentially unifying the currently fragmented landscape of wireless communication devices, from mobile phones to satellites. The article suggests this chip could be thousands of times faster than current rural U.S. internet speeds, enabling rapid data transmission for applications like high-definition streaming and advanced remote services. This development could represent a significant step forward in next-generation wireless technology.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois has launched IL Pride Connect, a first-of-its-kind legal hotline and digital resource hub designed to support the LGBTQ+ community. The initiative provides free, affirming legal advice and referrals on issues such as healthcare access and changing official documents. Governor JB Pritzker stated the hotline aims to combat discrimination by providing information and resources. This state-level action contrasts with federal moves under the Trump administration, which has cut funding for LGBTQ+ health initiatives and youth suicide prevention services, highlighting a growing divergence in policy between different levels of government.</p>

          <p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has announced a 90-day extension for tariff exclusions on 178 specific products imported from China. These items, which include chemical materials, medical supplies, and electronic components, will continue to be exempt from the Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25%. The tariffs were originally imposed during President Trump's first term to address what the U.S. deemed unfair trade practices by China. The USTR stated the decision to extend the exclusions was based on public comments and advice from interagency committees, and that further modifications may be considered in the future.</p>
