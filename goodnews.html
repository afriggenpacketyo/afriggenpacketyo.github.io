          <p>European stock markets began the week with gains, as investors monitored a critical confidence vote in France that Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected to lose. The vote was called by Bayrou himself amid political gridlock over proposed budget cuts aimed at reducing the national deficit. Major indices like France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX saw notable increases, with retail stocks leading the gains. The market's positive performance also comes as investors anticipate key U.S. inflation data later in the week, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.</p>

They are replacing long-time hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were dismissed in July following a report that upheld unspecified claims against them. Dent has been a frequent guest judge, while Haugh has appeared on the spin-off series, MasterChef: The Professionals. The change marks a significant new era for the show, which has been a fixture of British television for two decades under its previous hosts.</p>

          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is back on stage after a life-altering tongue cancer diagnosis in 2022 required the removal and reconstruction of most of his tongue.

          <p>A moose, believed to have traveled from Poland through the Czech Republic, has become a local celebrity in northeastern Austria after weeks of roaming the area. The animal, nicknamed Emil, has garnered a significant online following and even inspired an oil painting.
