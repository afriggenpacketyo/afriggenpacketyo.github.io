          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam to circumvent other duties. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a move the administration hopes will open new opportunities for American products. The agreement alters a previous tariff structure and comes ahead of a deadline for the expiration of a temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs with multiple countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration directive aimed at severely limiting access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president lacks the unilateral authority to supplant immigration laws enacted by Congress. The decision is a significant setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda, reaffirming that established legal processes for asylum claims must be followed, though the administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

The move is intended to make California more competitive and lure back productions that have moved to other states and countries offering more lucrative incentives. Industry leaders and unions have praised the legislation as a vital step to stimulate production and create jobs, especially after a period of slowdowns caused by strikes and other factors.</p>

Financial experts recommend shopping around with multiple lenders, asking about fee waivers, and carefully reading the fine print to ensure a HELOC remains an affordable financial tool.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling blocks a plan to end the protections in September, stating the administration does not have the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its legally scheduled expiration in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal, arguing the program was never meant to be permanent, while advocates for the migrants cite ongoing gang violence and instability in Haiti.</p>
