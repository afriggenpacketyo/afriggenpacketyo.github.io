          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprising pole position for the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 0.182 seconds. This marks Russell's first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix and a significant result for Mercedes at the Marina Bay circuit. Championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren will start in third, ahead of his teammate and title rival Lando Norris in fifth. Verstappen expressed frustration after his final qualifying lap, suggesting he was impeded by a slow-moving Norris, an incident Norris later dismissed.</p>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members for approximately $499 for a four-week supply. This price is roughly half the typical out-of-pocket cost and is available to members with a valid prescription who are not covered by insurance. The move aims to provide access to authentic, brand-name versions of these high-demand drugs, countering the trend of consumers seeking cheaper, unregulated compounded alternatives. This partnership could significantly increase accessibility and affordability for these treatments.</p>

          <p>After two decades of meticulous restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. The 3,000-year-old site is one of the largest in the valley and had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led conservation project began. The restoration involved over 260 specialists and was praised for its high international standards. The tomb, first discovered in 1799, features exquisite wall paintings and contains burial chambers for the king and two of his queens, Tiye and Sitamun.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to several key components of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Donald Trump, notably the release of all hostages. In response, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe return of hostages, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed preparations to implement the plan's first phase. While Hamas's response is viewed as a positive step, the group indicated that some aspects of the deal, particularly those concerning the future governance of Gaza, require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework.</p>

          <p>Mohammed Kudus, Tottenham Hotspur's £55m summer signing from West Ham, scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 victory against Leeds. The Ghanaian international has been an influential player for Spurs, already providing four assists this season, and his performance was praised by manager Thomas Frank and pundits like Wayne Rooney. Kudus has been a creative force in the midfield, especially with key players like James Maddison injured. His goal, combined with his strong dribbling and work rate, is seen as a significant step in fulfilling the high expectations set for him.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have added veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw to their roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.

The Dodgers also added left-handed pitcher Anthony Banda to strengthen their pitching depth against the Phillies' lineup. Catcher Will Smith, who is recovering from a fractured hand, also remains on the active roster, though his immediate availability to start is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 achieving a record high this week despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare and utilities sectors performed particularly well, driven by a pharmaceutical tariff deal and the increasing power demands of AI data centers. The article notes that investor sentiment has largely treated the shutdown as a "non-event" for the market. Investment analysts highlighted strong earnings from companies like Nike, while also noting downgrades for others such as Wells Fargo and Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. Analysts argue that American investors exhibit a strong "home bias," potentially missing out on better value and growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. The article highlights that while U.S. markets have performed well, the long-term growth trajectory in countries with large populations and rapidly expanding economies could offer significant benefits. This strategy is presented as a way to balance portfolios and capitalize on global economic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the human-smuggling prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Trump administration. The judge granted a hearing after finding "some evidence" of vindictive prosecution, citing the timing of the charges and public statements by administration officials. The charges were filed shortly after Ábrego successfully sued the government over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador and the Supreme Court ordered his return to the U.S. The case has become a focal point in the broader political conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which led to at least 10 deaths, were sparked by demands for lower wheat and electricity prices and an end to benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands and pledged to improve public services. The alliance leader, Shaukat Nawaz Mir, announced the end of the protests, expressing gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues.</p>
