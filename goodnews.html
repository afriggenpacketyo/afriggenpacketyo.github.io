        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, President Trump advised graduates to avoid "trophy wives," using an anecdote about a real estate developer's divorce. The speech also touched on his administration's isolationist stances and the ending of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Trump stated that the military's job is to dominate foes and eliminate threats, not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures. He referenced his own legal troubles, claiming he was investigated more than Al Capone, despite being convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Kids</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs to foster resilience, trust, and connection. This approach focuses on open communication, self-awareness, and inner healing, setting clear boundaries with empathy rather than control. Emotionally safe parents view misbehavior as a signal for support, respond without shaming, and take responsibility for conflicts. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through reconnection and validation.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul, the 12th-seeded tennis player, secured a victory in his first-round match at the French Open, shortly after resolving an unusual issue involving his repossessed truck. Paul's truck was repossessed due to missed payments after he switched banks and forgot to update his automatic payment settings. He discovered the repossession through his trainer's security camera footage and was able to recover the vehicle. Paul humorously shared the story, posting footage of the repossession set to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses the debate between investing in U.S. versus European stocks, noting that while U.S. stocks have underperformed recently, they are not inherently bad investments. The article explains that President Trump's tariff announcements have created market pressure, particularly for tech companies. Despite the recent outperformance of European markets, the article emphasizes that U.S. stocks have historically delivered stronger long-term returns, and owning S&P 500 companies provides substantial international exposure (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who transformed military protocol for delivering death notifications, is recounted. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams delivered during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for service members to personally notify families and offer support. Her efforts led to a fundamental change in how the Army handles casualty notifications, providing comfort and assistance to grieving families. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore in her and her husband's honor, marking the first time an American military base had been named for a civilian.</p>
