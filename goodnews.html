          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 00:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has reportedly completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein. In the trial, a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke was able to regain some limb movement. This approach is presented as a lower-risk alternative to methods like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, potentially offering a safer path for neurotechnology applications and faster patient recovery.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball at 52-31. Despite a performance their manager described as not their best, the team managed to secure the win. Key moments included a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani and a game-tying triple from him later, followed by a go-ahead single from Mookie Betts. The bullpen held off a late Royals rally, with closer Tanner Scott inducing a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season. Maresca expressed his high regard for the player, seeing him as a potential top defender for the club in the long term. The current plan is for Acheampong to remain with the team to continue his development, with a loan only being considered if it is mutually agreed to be the best path forward.</p>

The pandas‚Äî24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China next year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found that working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet have a lower rate of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The study, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after isolating other potential influencing factors. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in the city and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>British retailer Marks & Spencer has launched a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, inspired by the viral Japanese "fruit sando." The sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, quickly became the chain's top-selling sandwich after its release. Fruit sandwiches are a popular snack in Japan, often sold in convenience stores and bakeries, and have recently gained global attention through social media. The M&S version appears to be the first time the confection has been widely available in UK supermarkets, blending a traditional British flavor combination with a Japanese culinary concept.</p>

After being purchased by a Nagoya-based company in 2021, it has been renovated into the six-suite Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate, which will open in July.

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever images from beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Launched two months ago, the satellite uses a special P-band radar frequency that can penetrate clouds and thick foliage. This pioneering technology allows scientists to measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks and to detect previously hidden deforestation. The ultimate goal is to create a global 3D map of the world's forests, offering a much more accurate understanding of their vital role in mitigating climate change.</p>
