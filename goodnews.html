          <p>Japan's parliament has passed a law mandating 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in fiscal year 2026, in an effort to advance the country's green transformation and decarbonization. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, estimating that these companies account for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the threshold must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While aiming to lower emissions, the system may result in price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

The reason for this decision is not explicitly stated, but it is likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns.

However, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, mitigating "extremely severe bumps" to a more tolerable level.

          <p>A judge struck down an executive order from President Trump targeting WilmerHale, marking another victory for law firms resisting the administration's efforts to subjugate them. The judge deemed the order unconstitutional, noting that it appeared designed to force the firm into submission through severe sanctions. The ruling supports the strategy of fighting back against the administration's pressure campaign rather than complying with its demands. The case highlights the administration's use of federal power to punish firms associated with political opponents.</p>
