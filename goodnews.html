          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a comprehensive plan to cut key interest rates and reduce the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as consumption and elderly care, with additional support for small and medium enterprises anticipated soon. The stimulus announcement coincides with planned trade talks between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision aligns with the preferences of Arab nations, though Iran maintains its historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. While the U.S. military has used Arabian Gulf in its communications, the change is likely to be controversial, especially in Iran, where the name Persian Gulf is deeply connected to national identity.</p>

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology to produce aluminium from low-grade ore, reducing the country's reliance on imported bauxite. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello of IB2, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This development aligns with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminium industry. In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology.</p>
