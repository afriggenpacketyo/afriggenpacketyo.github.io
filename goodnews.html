          <p>Hamas has provided a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal, signaling readiness for immediate negotiations. The plan, backed by the U.S., reportedly includes a 60-day truce, a phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. While Israel has reportedly accepted the conditions, Hamas's key demand remains a guarantee that Israeli military operations will not resume after the ceasefire. The development comes amid ongoing Israeli strikes across Gaza and international calls to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The tech IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged slump, with crypto company Circle's stock surging sixfold since its June debut. This performance, along with other recent IPOs and the upcoming Figma offering, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms. While VCs are "cautiously optimistic," the recovery is not yet considered a sustained trend, as many large private companies remain on the sidelines. The industry hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts and loosened regulations to further entice companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience has outlined five "toxic" foods he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can lead to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor recommends healthier alternatives such as air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>Renowned filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history, asserting that it created the novel concept of a "citizen." In an interview ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary, Burns explained that before the revolution, people were subjects under a ruler. He argued that the Declaration of Independence, despite its initial exclusions, set in motion a global movement toward equality and self-governance. Burns emphasized the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history to create a richer, more inclusive national story.</p>

          <p>A provision in a new spending bill creates a temporary federal income tax deduction for tips, a move touted by the White House as a win for the working class. The new rule, effective through 2028, allows tipped workers like restaurant servers and bartenders to deduct their tip income from their federal tax liability. However, critics and policy experts point out that the benefit does not extend to the lowest-wage workers, many of whom earn too little to have a federal tax liability in the first place. Labor advocates argue that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-income workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order to stop the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, a country torn by civil war. The ruling came just one day after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for their removal. The immigrants, who are not from South Sudan, were flown to a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, but their transfer was halted after their lawyers filed an emergency request. The judge sent the case to another court in Boston, extending the stay to allow for a hearing on new claims made by the immigrants' legal team.</p>

          <p>Nutrition experts highlight that unsweetened iced tea can be a healthy and hydrating beverage, offering a flavorful alternative to water. Teas from the Camellia sinensis plant, such as green and black tea, are rich in polyphenols and antioxidants that may reduce the risk of chronic illnesses. Herbal teas like hibiscus and chamomile offer additional benefits, such as supporting healthy blood pressure and providing stress relief, without caffeine. To maximize health advantages, experts recommend fresh-brewing the tea, whether hot or cold, and being mindful of added sugars.</p>

However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, stormed back with the second new ball, causing a late collapse as England's final five wickets fell for just 20 runs. Despite England's heroics, India holds a commanding overall lead of 244 runs with nine wickets in hand.</p>

Hamilton, who is seeking a record-extending tenth win at his home race, noted that Ferrari's pace was positive, especially since rivals McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades.</p>
