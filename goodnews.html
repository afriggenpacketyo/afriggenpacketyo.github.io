          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment in tariff negotiations with the United States, according to Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, as President Trump hints at raising auto import levies. Akazawa expressed optimism that Japan will be treated differently from other countries once a deal is finalized, particularly regarding auto tariffs. He is scheduled to visit Washington for further talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. The focus of negotiations includes securing concessions on auto tariffs and removing additional sector-based tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan.

          <p>The Brit School in Croydon has been awarded government funding to address building conditions, including a ceiling collapse, which forced the closure of a classroom and changing rooms. The school, known for its famous alumni, is among over 70 London schools receiving support through the Condition Improvement Fund (CIF). The funding will replace the main building's roof and address fire safety concerns.

          <h2>India Aims to Develop Rare Earth Reserves as Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 01:26:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth reserves to reduce reliance on China, which has imposed restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative for countries like the U.S., but it requires increased public and private investment. The recent shortage of rare earth elements (REEs) has highlighted China's dominance, as it produces approximately 60% of the world's supply and processes nearly 90%. India's potential to develop its domestic supplies could ease the global reliance on China for these crucial minerals.</p>

          <p>An expert from the World Gold Council asserts that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist, notes that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasizes that these digital assets have different characteristics and do not represent any risks or comparison to gold. His comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and a fresh rally in gold prices due to heightened Middle East tensions.</p>
