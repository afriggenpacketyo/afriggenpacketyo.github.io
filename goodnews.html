          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in an extraordinary qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, was repeatedly halted due to numerous crashes, including incidents involving Alex Albon, Nico Hulkenberg, and both Alpine drivers in the first segment alone. The final shootout was further disrupted by crashes from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and McLaren's Oscar Piastri, with light rain adding to the treacherous conditions. Verstappen capitalized on the final restart to set the fastest time, narrowly beating Williams' Carlos Sainz.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and have returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades, running a charitable training program. Their release was brokered by Qatar, and they were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London. The Taliban never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention, stating only that the pair had broken Afghan laws. The family had previously expressed grave concerns about the couple's declining health in captivity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These rights were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, granting the White House veto power over major operational decisions. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision to idle the plant. This marks the first use of these national-security-related powers, highlighting a direct presidential intervention in corporate strategy to protect American jobs.</p>

          <p>In an interview at The Atlantic Festival, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discussed her 2014 Vanity Fair essay as a pivotal moment in reintroducing herself to the public on her own terms, noting how younger generations viewed her situation through a lens of power dynamics. Lewinsky connected her experience to the broader cultural reckoning with the misogynistic treatment of women in that era and the subsequent #MeToo movement. She emphasized the importance of empathy, self-worth, and humor in surviving unimaginable public shaming.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump held a nearly two-hour phone conversation described by both sides as productive and constructive. The call, their third this year, touched upon trade issues and a deal concerning TikTok. Following the discussion, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting with Xi at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea and a potential visit to China early next year. While the high-level engagement sparks hope for stabilizing tense bilateral relations, analysts remain cautious due to persistent friction points like Taiwan and tariff threats.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Adopts Quieter Approach to Announcing Warship Transits Through Taiwan Strait</h2>

          <p>The United States appears to have shifted its policy regarding public announcements of its warships transiting the sensitive Taiwan Strait. Under the previous administration, such freedom-of-navigation operations were regularly publicized, drawing routine condemnation from Beijing about "public hype." Since President Trump's return to office, there have been only three known transits, which were confirmed by the U.S. only after media inquiries. Some observers view this change as a tactical move to reduce direct friction with China, though it does not represent a substantive change in the U.S. policy of sailing through the international waterway.</p>

Students cite affordability as a primary motivator, with European tuition often being significantly lower than in the U.S. The political landscape and campus protests following the 2024 election are also pushing students to seek international perspectives and a different social environment for their education.</p>

          <p>According to Dr. Adam Friedman, a professor of dermatology, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors. While standard window glass typically filters out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, it does not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, contributing to accelerated aging, collagen damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer without any visible burning. Because this exposure is unfelt, Friedman calls it a "silent killer" and recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on days spent primarily inside near windows.</p>

The article explores how Saudi investment is filling a void left by departing broadcasters like HBO, creating a new economic model for the sport.

This model created a unique form of "concert tourism," allowing attendees to immerse themselves in the culture that is central to the artist's identity. However, the event also highlights the complex relationship between tourism and the island's struggles with gentrification, resource shortages, and economic sovereignty. While the residency was a celebration of Puerto Rican pride and was expected to provide an economic boost, it also raised uneasy questions about who ultimately benefits from such large-scale, tourist-dependent events.</p>
