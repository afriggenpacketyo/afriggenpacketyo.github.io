          <p>More than two years after declaring bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is relaunching under the new name "Bed Bath & Beyond Home." The first new store is opening in Nashville, managed by The Brand House Collective, which plans to focus on a curated selection of home goods. In a move to attract loyal customers, the company has announced it will honor the iconic blue and white legacy coupons from the original chain. This reopening marks a significant step in the brand's turnaround effort, though analysts note the company still faces financial challenges.</p>

          <p>The four astronauts of SpaceX's Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their journey back to Earth. Commanded by Anne McClain, the crew is scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, concluding their 148-day mission. This marks the first NASA-sponsored Crew Dragon landing in the Pacific, a change made to ensure the spacecraft's discarded trunk section falls in a remote area. The crew's departure followed a week-long handover with their replacements, the newly arrived Crew-11.</p>

          <p>A profile explores the surprising personal bond between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance's holiday visit to Lammy's official country residence in Kent showcased their friendship, which they attribute to shared experiences with faith, family, and challenging upbringings. This relationship is seen as potentially significant for U.S.-UK diplomacy, especially given President Trump's personalized approach to foreign relations. The article notes that such personal connections can be crucial, even if they don't override national interests.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Shaman," directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, offers a unique take on demonic possession through an Andean lens. The movie follows two English-speaking missionaries in a remote region of Ecuador whose son appears to be possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual traditions. Filmed on location near the Chimborazo volcano with the cooperation of the local Indigenous community, the film incorporates the Kichwa language and authentic rituals. The review highlights the film's raw, personal feel and its use of the Supay, a demon from Andean mythology, to provide a fresh perspective on the exorcism genre.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times is unsubstantiated. A fact-check found no evidence to support the claim and noted that Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip capable of landing a plane of that size. Guests reportedly arrived via helicopter or boat from a nearby island. The user who made the claim was also found to be wearing a costume pilot pin, further discrediting their credentials and the assertion.</p>

          <p>To combat rising loneliness, the city of Seoul has opened several "warm-hearted convenience stores," which serve as welcoming community spaces. These centers offer free ramen noodles, comfortable seating, and access to social workers, providing an escape for isolated individuals, including a growing number of young people. The initiative was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a recognition of the societal challenges posed by single-person households and a highly competitive culture. The program aims to provide a low-stigma environment for people to connect and find support.</p>

          <p>The recent death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell brings the number of living astronauts who have journeyed to the Moon down to just five. This small, aging group of pioneers includes Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott, who all walked on the lunar surface, and Fred Haise, who was part of the perilous Apollo 13 mission. The article reflects on their stories and legacies as NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972. Their dwindling numbers highlight the passage of time since the historic Apollo era.</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media that he had alerted authorities to a dinghy coming ashore, demanding mass deportations. It was later revealed the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his error, the MP apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump indicated that because of this commitment to U.S. manufacturing, Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips. This news appeared to alleviate investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the company's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>
