          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's shares surged despite the retailer lowering its full-year earnings per share guidance to between $9.50 and $10.50, down from $10.40 to $11.40, due to an expected $50 million impact from tariffs. The company's operating margin forecast was also reduced from 14-15% to 12.5-13.5%. However, first-quarter results exceeded expectations with earnings per share at $1.59 versus the expected $1.39 and revenue reaching $1.10 billion against an expected $1.07 billion. CEO Fran Horowitz noted strong sales growth, particularly in the Hollister brand, and Abercrombie is diversifying its sourcing network to mitigate tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>June Could Be a Smart Time to Consolidate Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 16:08:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consolidating credit card debt this June could be advantageous due to persistently high credit card interest rates, which are unlikely to decline soon. Rates on alternative borrowing products, like home equity loans and HELOCs, have been decreasing, making them attractive options for consolidation. Credit card interest compounds daily, quickly increasing debt, so consolidating with a lower-rate loan could save money and allow for larger principal payments. Consulting with a financial advisor or debt relief servicer can help create a personalized debt consolidation plan. (not investment advice)</p>
