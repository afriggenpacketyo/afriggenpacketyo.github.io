          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, narrowly missing his house. The 135-meter Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, with 16 people on board, went off course in the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a 7% fall in energy prices starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year for 22 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This translates to an annual bill decrease of ¬£129 for a typical household, reflecting a drop in wholesale gas prices. However, charities caution that many people still struggle with energy costs, with customers owing approximately ¬£4 billion to suppliers. Despite the price cap reduction, energy bills remain higher than previous years, and concerns persist regarding the financial strain on vulnerable households.</p>

BYD's BEV sales increased by 169% year-on-year, while Tesla's sales fell by 49%. This milestone reflects the growing influence of Chinese carmakers in the European EV market, even with EU tariffs. The growth in BEV sales is largely attributed to Chinese firms, as BEV sales jumped 59 percent year on year in April to nearly 15,300 units.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett, the former "Empire" actor, has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity. The city had sued Smollett seeking restitution for the cost of investigating his claims that he was the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett's conviction for staging the incident was overturned, and he maintained the attack was real. The settlement allows all parties to close this chapter and move forward.</p>

          <p>As Japan's population ages, an increasing number of seniors are choosing to make charitable bequests after death, donating their assets to hospitals, nonprofits, and other entities. This trend is largely due to the rise in childless couples with no heirs, and a growing awareness of bequest donations. Organizations are now acting as intermediaries between donors and recipients, facilitating the process through wills or trusts. These donations support a range of causes, including childcare, healthcare, and education.</p>
