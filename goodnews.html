          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention following a judge's ruling that his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested in March, with US authorities accusing him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist." The judge refuted the government's claims, stating there was no evidence he made statements in support of Hamas. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving more than three decades. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision has been described as "monumental" by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, with the case now going to the California Board of Parole Hearings. The brothers' family members have expressed joy and hope for their release, while the prosecution maintains they should not be released at all.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to permit foreign states to acquire up to a 15% stake in British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. This decision follows a previous ban on foreign-state ownership triggered by a takeover bid for The Telegraph and The Spectator. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that the changes aim to protect "media plurality" while allowing publishers to secure vital funding. The move comes after consultations revealed that a complete ban was deemed too restrictive for attracting financing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has voiced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas, emphasizing the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised budget proposal will also include provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and Senator Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills designed to ease the permitting process for infill projects, which are developments in existing urban areas.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, dropping by nearly 30,000, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC credited President Trump for allocating more resources to address the drug problem since declaring the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2017. However, this positive trend coincides with proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. Experts worry that these cuts could undermine the progress made in reducing drug fatalities.</p>

          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, paving the way for their possible release, the culture and politics of the 1990s came under scrutiny. The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, argued that criminal justice policies of the era contributed to their harsh sentences and that attitudes have evolved since then. The case, which became a media sensation, was shaped by the crime and the criminal justice climate of the 1990s, and new interest fueled by social media helped inject momentum into the slow-moving legal process.</p>
