          <p>Silent book clubs are experiencing a surge in popularity, offering a unique social experience centered around reading in a shared space. Unlike traditional book clubs, members can read any book they choose, fostering a relaxing and mindful environment. The clubs provide a chance to unplug from technology and enjoy the comfort of reading alongside others, with optional discussions following the silent reading period. Originating in San Francisco in 2012, the trend has expanded globally, appealing to those seeking social interaction without the pressure of constant conversation, offering a comfortable space for book lovers to enjoy reading in each other's presence.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly advances, workplace leaders are debating how to balance technological progress with the need to protect jobs and ethical considerations. Some experts warn that AI could exacerbate inequality by displacing workers and accelerating existing biases in data. While some advocate for upskilling employees to adapt to AI-driven changes, others suggest that protecting employment might not be the right approach, emphasizing the need to adapt employment models. Companies are encouraged to prioritize ethical AI implementation and workforce transformation while addressing potential negative consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address England's social care system for older and disabled adults is an untenable decision. The report highlights the financial and human costs of the current broken system, which relies heavily on unpaid carers and consumes an increasing proportion of councils' budgets. The committee suggests that investing an additional ¬£1 billion in social care could create 50,000 jobs and generate a ¬£1.75 return to the wider economy for every ¬£1 invested. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and states it has "hit the ground running" on social care improvements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that China's recent anti-corruption crackdown within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does not indicate a weakening of President Xi Jinping's control over the military. The campaign has targeted high-ranking officials, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), for corruption. Experts believe the impact on the military's war readiness and modernization is limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. The investigations and removals of key figures underscore the ongoing efforts to maintain discipline and loyalty within the PLA.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Vatican employs a centuries-old ritual involving smoke signals to announce the election of a new pope, captivating a global audience. The process involves two stoves temporarily installed in the Sistine Chapel: one for burning ballots and the other for generating smoke. Chemical compounds are used to create black smoke (no pope elected) or white smoke (a pope has been chosen). The tradition, while symbolic, requires meticulous engineering and organization, involving custom fireworks, smoke tests, and Vatican firefighters on standby. The use of smoke is meant to evoke religious rituals and include the public in the secretive process.</p>

The closure was praised by animal rights groups and some lawmakers, who have long criticized the NIH's animal testing practices. PETA highlighted Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for tests in Tunisia where beagle puppies were drugged, and their heads were locked in cages filled with hungry, infected sandflies.</p>

Trump claims that the US was plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders.

While May acknowledged the need for more consistency with the pitch, the Dodgers' offense couldn't complete the comeback despite late-game efforts. The Dodgers are seeking for someone to step up alongside staff ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto, May's recent regression has been the bigger disappointment.</p>

While right-wing parties emulating Trump's MAGA playbook have been punished in Canada and Australia, other countries are experiencing more complex effects. In Germany, Trump's election has helped push through spending limit suspensions. The article suggests that voters are considering Trump's influence when making decisions, and that some leaders are benefiting from a perception of stability amid Trump's unpredictable actions.</p>
