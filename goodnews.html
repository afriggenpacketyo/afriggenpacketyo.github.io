          <p>Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike saw its stock surge after presenting a highly optimistic long-term financial roadmap at its investor day. The company projected significant growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR), aiming for $10 billion by 2031 and $20 billion by 2036, alongside expanding operating and free cash flow margins. This positive forecast is partly driven by the company's strategic focus on securing artificial intelligence agents, a rapidly growing sector with new vulnerabilities, and its recent acquisition of AI security startup Pangea.

          <p>A new film by director Paul Thomas Anderson, titled "One Battle After Another," is receiving praise for its compelling blend of high-stakes action and timely political commentary. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former anti-fascist vigilante living in hiding, the movie explores themes of government overreach and political violence in a contemporary American setting. The article highlights the film's departure from Anderson's typically historical settings, delivering a bleak but captivating story that feels both urgent and emotionally resonant. Strong performances from DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti are also noted as key strengths.</p>

Governor Kathy Hochul's budget allocates $9 million to the program, which will provide 100,000 kits containing essential items like diapers and hygiene products to mothers on Medicaid. The partnership highlights Baby2Baby's ongoing mission to address diaper need, a significant financial burden for low-income families. The organization has developed a system to manufacture diapers at a fraction of retail cost, enabling wider distribution.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor Group has confirmed it will proceed with a $2.7 billion expansion of its electric vehicle plant in Georgia, despite a recent immigration raid that delayed a related battery facility and created diplomatic tensions. The investment will increase the plant's production capacity to 500,000 vehicles annually and expand its lineup to ten electric and hybrid models, including a new mid-sized pickup truck. The decision reaffirms the company's long-term strategic commitment to localizing production in the United States. Both Hyundai and Georgia officials have been working to mitigate the fallout from the raid, which involved the arrest of over 300 South Korean citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal jury has acquitted a Los Angeles protester, Brayan Ramos-Brito, of assaulting a border patrol agent during a demonstration in June, a verdict seen as a setback for federal prosecutors. The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents' testimony, particularly that of border patrol chief Gregory Bovino, who was the only agent to claim he witnessed the assault. Witness footage, which showed an agent forcefully shoving the protester but did not capture an assault by him, contradicted the official account. The trial also highlighted factual discrepancies in initial DHS reports and brought up past misconduct allegations against Bovino, undermining the prosecution's case.</p>

          <p>Ted Leonsis, owner of Washington D.C.'s Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, has reaffirmed his ambition to acquire the local MLB and MLS teams to expand his sports empire. Through his company Monumental Sports & Entertainment, Leonsis aims to create a "branded platform company" where teams share resources like sales and media, enhancing their competitiveness. He explained that this integrated model, which operates like a tech company, would provide significant advantages for teams like the Washington Nationals and D.C. United. Despite recent unsuccessful bids, Leonsis remains committed to this regional strategy, believing it offers greater value than acquiring teams in other cities.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a more natural user interface based on voice, sight, and gestures. The statement came as the company unveiled its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband. This new model allows users to not only record video and audio but also see messages and watch videos, a significant step up from previous versions. As Meta deepens its investment in wearable technology, it faces growing competition from rivals like Google, Snap, and Apple.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has decreased slightly, making it a more affordable option for homeowners looking to borrow against their record-high equity. For a $50,000 loan, the article calculates that a 10-year term now costs approximately $618 per month, while a 15-year term is around $487 per month. While these costs are not dramatically lower than before, they represent tangible savings over the life of the loan. The article also notes that Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently offer slightly lower variable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the historical and ongoing tension within American higher education, which has been pulled between three competing purposes: cultural formation, career preparation, and academic research. The article traces this conflict back to the late 19th century, contrasting the classical, culture-focused curriculum of the old college model with the practical, career-oriented vision championed by figures like Harvard President Charles W. Eliot. This push-and-pull, later complicated by the rise of the research-focused university, created a hybrid system with inherent contradictions. The author argues that this foundational debate over what college is for has never been resolved and remains urgent today.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of anticompetitive and deceptive practices. The suit alleges that the companies facilitate the resale of tickets by brokers at inflated prices, costing consumers billions, and use "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics. According to the FTC, Ticketmaster publicly claims to oppose brokers while privately benefiting from their activities, which prevents consumers from buying tickets at artist-set prices. This legal action follows a separate antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice in May against the companies.</p>

Lyles is known for his outspoken attempts to unsettle rivals, though his recent comments about a competitor "panicking" before the 100m final preceded his own third-place finish. Former athletes and experts interviewed in the article discuss the high-pressure environment of call rooms and the various strategies competitors use to gain a mental edge, from projecting quiet confidence to overt intimidation.

          <p>A storm system originating from a dissipated tropical storm is bringing widespread, unseasonal rain to Southern California, with some areas experiencing minor flooding. While the precipitation is a welcome sight for a region that has not seen measurable rain in months, officials say it will have a minimal impact on the severe drought conditions. Meteorologists and fire officials warn that the rainfall is not nearly enough to significantly reduce the risk of a dangerous wildfire season. To meaningfully diminish the fire threat, the region would need several inches of rain, far more than this storm is expected to deliver.</p>

The administration had attempted to expel the minors over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the request of the Guatemalan government. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return. In fact, a Guatemalan government report revealed that officials could not find a single parent who affirmatively wanted their child sent back, undermining the administration's entire premise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with substantial credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt forgiveness through settlement can offer significant relief. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a reduced lump sum, often resulting in a 30% to 50% reduction of the total amount owed. The article contrasts this with the slow and costly process of making traditional payments on high-interest debt, which can take over a decade and accrue massive interest charges. While debt settlement can impact one's credit score, it provides a much faster path to becoming debt-free for those in overwhelming financial situations. (not investment advice)</p>
