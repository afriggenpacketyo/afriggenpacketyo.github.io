        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling an easing of inflation pressures. The decision comes after President Vladimir Putin described inflation pressures as "alarming" not long ago. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, down from an average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand growth still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the central bank noted that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. The central bank plans to maintain a tight monetary policy for an extended period to bring inflation back to its 4% target. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has changed its position on the Western Sahara conflict, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy stating that the Moroccan autonomy plan is the "most credible" position. This marks a shift from London's previous support for a UN-led referendum to determine the region's future. The new position aligns with that of other Western countries, and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita has welcomed the change. Experts note that while the UK is showing flexibility, it still emphasizes the relevance of the UN-led political process. The Western Sahara region is coveted for its mineral resources, and Morocco has been investing in tourism infrastructure there.</p>

          <h2>Hiring Slows Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hiring in the U.S. slowed in May due to businesses expressing concerns over President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, though the job market remained resilient. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the 177,000 jobs added in April, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Federal government employment saw a decline of 22,000 jobs in May, totaling 59,000 losses since January. The economic data comes as Trump rolled back some "Liberation Day" tariffs following a trade agreement with China, though tariffs still apply to many imports. The labor market's performance has largely defied fears of a downturn, maintaining low unemployment and cooling inflation.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson's new film, 'The Phoenician Scheme,' explores themes of wealth and power through a tycoon character inspired by old-fashioned European magnates. Anderson acknowledges that current events, including the preening foolishness of today's mega-rich land barons, have filtered into the film. The movie follows Zsa-zsa Korda, a merciless man, as he travels the globe, with his cruelty being moderated by his daughter and his unspoken fear of death. The director's inspiration came from his father-in-law, a Lebanese engineer, and the film explores the sins of fatherhood.</p>
