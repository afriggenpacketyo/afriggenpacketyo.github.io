          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of debate among dermatologists and researchers. While popular in various forms, from drinks to creams, there is skepticism about whether ingested collagen can successfully navigate the digestive system and reach the skin to provide benefits. Consultant dermatologists note that collagen molecules in creams are too large to penetrate the skin's surface effectively. Furthermore, studies on oral supplements show conflicting results, with industry-funded research often suggesting positive outcomes while independent studies find little to no effect. Experts suggest that sun protection, a healthy diet, and not smoking have a far greater impact on skin health.</p>

          <p>St Helens secured a stunning Super League play-off eliminator win against Leeds Rhinos with a try scored by Shane Wright after the final hooter. In a frantic final play, Saints executed a 16-pass move that crossed the width of the pitch, allowing Wright to score the decisive try and seal a 16-14 victory. The dramatic finish came after St Helens played the second half a man down, as forward Matty Lees departed at halftime for the birth of his child. The victory, which marks the only time St Helens led in the entire match, sets them up for a semi-final against Hull KR.</p>

          <p>Marking 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, this article reflects on the dramatic shift in their technological standing. Decades ago, Chinese officials visiting Europe concluded their country was at least 20 years behind in science and technology, a realization that helped spur the nation's reform and opening-up policy. This policy initiated a period of rapid growth that has fundamentally altered the global tech landscape. The article poses the question of whether China has now surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, examining the reversal of roles that has occurred over the past half-century.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A task force has identified twelve potential locations, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London being the most promising initial sites. Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce the plans, which aim to deliver up to 300,000 homes over several decades, with a requirement that at least 40% be classified as affordable housing. The developments will be managed by corporations with special planning powers, mirroring the model used for the 2012 London Olympics regeneration.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Humberto May Interact with Nearby Storm System, Potentially Triggering Rare Fujiwhara Effect</h2>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major hurricane in the Atlantic, has a possibility of interacting with a nearby developing storm, which could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While forecasts predict Humberto will not make landfall, its potential "dance" with the second system, expected to be named Imelda, is being monitored. Experts note that typically the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one, and while a merger is unlikely in this case, any interaction could slightly change the storms' trajectories as the second system approaches the southeastern U.S.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the U.S. housing affordability crisis by manufacturing homes in a factory setting. The company claims its process can build a 10-ton house in about seven days, reducing costs by up to 20% and cutting delivery time in half compared to traditional construction. This innovative approach has been applied to disaster relief, such as providing 82 homes for residents displaced by the Lahaina wildfires in Maui. While modular construction currently represents a small fraction of the housing market, proponents believe its efficiency, reduced waste, and ability to overcome labor shortages could make it a key strategy for restoring affordable homeownership.

          <p>Paul McCartney performed an intimate warm-up concert at the 4,500-seat Santa Barbara Bowl ahead of the next leg of his "Got Back" world tour. The show featured a slightly condensed setlist but included a range of Beatles classics, Wings hits, and solo material, from an energetic "Helter Skelter" to a surprise opening with "Help!". Despite the nostalgic nature of his recent projects, the 83-year-old musician appeared engaged and spontaneous, sharing stories about Jimi Hendrix and his mother's inspiration for "Let It Be." The smaller venue and a phone-free policy allowed the audience to focus on the musicianship of McCartney and his long-serving band.</p>

          <p>The British government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the automaker support its suppliers amid a prolonged production halt caused by a major cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced JLR to suspend operations, raising concerns that many of its 700 suppliers could face financial collapse. The loan, underwritten through the Export Development Guarantee, is intended to protect thousands of jobs and provide certainty to the supply chain as JLR works to recover. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the decisive action would safeguard skilled jobs across the UK automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement with Rudy Giuliani, ending its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against him. The suit was filed over Giuliani's baseless claims that the company's voting machines were involved in rigging the 2020 presidential election. The agreement was disclosed in a court filing, though the specific terms of the settlement were not made public. This resolution follows Dominion's nearly $800 million settlement with Fox News and another with Newsmax over similar election-related conspiracy theories. For Giuliani, this marks another legal consequence stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, adding to his existing financial and professional challenges.</p>

Ryan states that the lower cost of living in Vietnam removes the constant financial pressure he felt in America, allowing him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival. He describes Vietnam as a safe and calm country where he feels motivated and able to invest in his future, a stark contrast to the economic struggles he faced in the U.S.</p>

The mission will sequester four volunteers inside a 1,700-square-foot habitat at Johnson Space Center to study the psychological and physical effects of long-duration space travel. Elder was chosen for his extensive experience in high-stress environments, technical expertise in engineering, and leadership skills honed over 1,800 flight hours. His background is considered ideal for managing the challenges of isolation, resource limitation, and simulated emergencies that the crew will face during their 378-day confinement, providing crucial data for future missions to Mars.</p>
