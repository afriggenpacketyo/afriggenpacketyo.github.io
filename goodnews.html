          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies, ruling the company violated an adult film star's freedom of expression by closing her Instagram account. Esperanza Gomez, who has over 5 million followers, had her account shut down for posting photos in her underwear, which Meta claimed violated its nudity rules. The court found Meta acted arbitrarily and applied its policies inconsistently, ordering a review of its terms to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge content moderation decisions.</p>

Recent data shows Democrats have lost over two million registered voters since 2020, while Republicans have gained a similar number, creating urgency within the party. The initiative will target venues like college campuses and farmers' markets, representing a direct effort by the DNC to rebuild its voter base and infrastructure ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced a bill to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, aiming to ban employers from using credit checks during the hiring process. Proponents argue that denying employment based on financial history is discriminatory, disproportionately affecting minorities and women, and is not an accurate predictor of job performance. The legislation seeks to remove what they describe as an unfair barrier to employment, particularly as poor credit is often linked to medical debt or periods of unemployment.

          <p>Prosecutors in the United Kingdom have dropped all charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who had both denied the allegations, were scheduled to stand trial in October. The prosecution stated it would offer no evidence, effectively ending the case, while the Chinese government has consistently maintained that the initial allegations were fabricated and a form of "malicious slander."</p>

          <p>Amid rising concerns over synthetic opioids like fentanyl, several German cities are implementing proactive measures to prevent a public health crisis similar to those seen in other countries. Model cities such as Essen, Hanover, and Berlin are developing emergency plans, training first responders, and expanding drug-testing programs to detect substances mixed with heroin. This initiative, supported by the federal government, aims to create an early warning system and enhance addiction care to avoid being overwhelmed by the deadly impact of these potent drugs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation for a second official state visit to the United Kingdom, an honor never before extended to a U.S. president. The visit is seen as a strategic diplomatic move by the British government, which recognizes Trump's deep admiration for the royal family as a key point of influence. This "soft power" approach aims to strengthen bilateral ties and potentially sway the U.S. president on critical issues like support for Ukraine, leveraging his personal fascination with the monarchy.</p>

          <p>A health trend circulating on social media promotes using magnesium lotion, often applied to the feet, as a remedy for improving sleep and other ailments, but scientific evidence supporting this claim is scarce. Dermatologists point out that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge, making significant absorption of magnesium unlikely. While some sleep experts acknowledge a potential placebo effect and low risk of harm, they do not recommend the lotion, noting that any perceived benefits are more likely due to the act of massage or the moisturizing properties of the lotion itself.</p>
