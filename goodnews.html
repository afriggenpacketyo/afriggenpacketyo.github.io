          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 15:08:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Liverpool has finalized the signing of French striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt for an initial fee of £69 million. The 23-year-old successfully passed a medical exam and has agreed to personal terms, pushing Liverpool's total summer spending beyond £250 million. Ekitike had a successful season in the Bundesliga, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists, which attracted interest from multiple top clubs. His arrival at Liverpool follows a career resurgence at Frankfurt after a challenging period at Paris St-Germain, where he struggled for consistent playing time.</p>

It also aims to reduce regulatory hurdles, including removing DEI requirements from the CHIPS Act, and create AI export packages for U.S. allies to compete with nations like China.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UC Berkeley have developed a groundbreaking at-home diagnostic test that utilizes the "coffee ring effect," the scientific phenomenon explaining why spilled coffee dries in a ring. This innovative method is reportedly up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests, capable of detecting biomarkers for diseases like COVID-19, sepsis, and prostate cancer. The test provides results in about twelve minutes by concentrating disease proteins into a visible, light-reactive ring, potentially revolutionizing personal health monitoring and making early detection more accessible.</p>

          <p>Following his return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence, spinner Liam Dawson is being hailed as a key asset for the England team. Former captain Michael Vaughan stated that Dawson's all-around package of controlled bowling, capable batting, and solid fielding makes England a stronger side, particularly on UK and Australian pitches. Dawson, who was recalled due to an injury to another player, quickly made an impact by dismissing a key Indian batsman on the first day of the fourth Test, vindicating long-held calls for his inclusion from the domestic cricket circuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan is currently a significantly cheaper option than a personal loan. With average home equity loan rates around 8.3%, compared to over 12.6% for personal loans, the monthly savings are substantial. For example, on a 15-year term, a borrower could save approximately $265 per month, which amounts to over $47,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The secured nature of home equity loans allows for lower interest rates, making them an attractive financing tool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. This move, aimed at boosting the housing market, would remove the tax currently levied on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for married couples. While the idea has been introduced in Congress and is supported by groups like the National Association of Realtors, experts suggest it could be costly and that a more likely outcome might be an increase in the exemption thresholds rather than a full elimination.

This rate would be higher than the 10% baseline agreed to by the UK but would avert the 30% tariff President Trump had previously threatened. In case the deal falls through, the EU is preparing significant retaliatory measures, threatening to impose its own tariffs on nearly €100 billion worth of U.S. imports, including products like bourbon whiskey and Boeing aircraft.</p>
