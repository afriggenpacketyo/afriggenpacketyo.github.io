        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to boost their collective crude oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This increase is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day and is a continuation of the group's strategy to gradually unwind voluntary supply cuts. The decision was reportedly influenced by a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories. This move accelerates the pace of production hikes seen in previous months, signaling confidence in summer demand despite recent price volatility from geopolitical tensions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors are examining the popular belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can cure migraines, a condition affecting millions of Americans. Experts suggest that the caffeine in these drinks can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels in the brain, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger for others and that relying on sugary sodas is not a healthy long-term solution. Healthier alternatives like organic coffee, watermelon with salt for electrolytes, and magnesium are recommended for managing migraine symptoms more effectively.</p>

          <h2>Reverend William Barber's 'Poor People's Campaign' Confronts Modern Political Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived "Poor People's Campaign," a national moral movement using nonviolent protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice in the United States. Rooted in a tradition of faith-based activism, the movement organizes protests and civil disobedience to oppose policies that cut social services like Medicaid and food assistance, which Barber terms "policy murder." The campaign aims to build a broad "fusion" coalition of poor and working-class people across different backgrounds to create a moral force for political change. This article questions whether this approach, which focuses on moral witness, can effectively counter the current political climate.</p>

          <h2>'Buy Now, Pay Later' Loans to Be Included in FICO Credit Score Calculations</h2>

          <p>FICO, the leading credit scoring company, has announced it will begin incorporating "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loan data into its credit score models, a change that will impact millions of consumers. For users who make their payments on time, this could help build a positive credit history, especially for younger individuals or those with limited credit. However, the change also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect credit scores, similar to traditional credit cards and loans. While the new scoring model will be available in fall 2025, experts note that widespread adoption by lenders may be slow.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Impotence Drugs Like Viagra May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties</h2>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have potential as a cancer-fighting agent. The findings, published in the journal Nature, indicate that the drug could help combat cancer by strengthening the immune system's dendritic cells. These crucial anti-tumor cells often become depleted or impaired as cancer progresses. According to the researchers, sildenafil appears capable of reversing this process and restoring the cells' function, potentially opening the door to a new form of tumor immunotherapy strategy.</p>

          <p>The community in Pasadena, California, came together to support Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale street vending business. His mother, a legal resident, became fearful of working after witnessing an immigration sweep at the local park where she sold her food. After a community activist shared Chris's story on social media, hundreds of customers lined up, buying out his entire stock and raising over $1,500 for his family. The event highlights the community's response to the fear and disruption caused by recent federal immigration enforcement actions in the area.</p>

          <p>Hamas has provided a 'positive response' to the latest U.S.-led proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations immediately. However, a Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several changes, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a U.S. guarantee that the war would not resume if talks fail. The proposed 60-day ceasefire plan is believed to involve a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The development comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House, with President Trump expressing hope for a deal next week.</p>

          <p>Following a UK Chancellor's tearful appearance in public, this article explores the evolving perceptions of crying at work. Executive coaches and career experts argue that showing emotion is no longer a sign of weakness but an indicator of emotional intelligence, and that compassionate employers foster more motivated and productive staff. The piece includes anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues. While some still fear being judged, others, like fashion designer Amy Powney, advocate for normalizing emotional expression in leadership, viewing it as a 'superpower' rather than a liability.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes underscored the blockchain's increasing integration into mainstream finance, with major players like Robinhood and Deutsche Bank building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced the launch of tokenized U.S. stocks on Arbitrum, an Ethereum-based network, while Deutsche Bank is developing a tokenization platform on another Ethereum layer. Despite market volatility, this institutional adoption signals a shift in focus from price speculation to utility, with firms valuing Ethereum's stability, security, and decade-long track record. Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, emphasized that this dependability is a key reason institutions are choosing the network. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. The project, which spans approximately 60,000 square meters, builds upon a similar initiative from May, together forming the largest offshore photovoltaic project of its kind for the company. The solar panels are designed to rise and fall with the tides, and their proximity to the water is expected to increase their energy generation efficiency by 5 to 8 percent. The combined projects are projected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, significantly reducing carbon emissions.</p>

Statistical analysis by Opta suggests a team from this group has a 37% chance of winning the entire tournament. The challenging draw means both home nations will need to be at their best from the very first match to have a chance of advancing to the knockout stages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the long-standing scientific debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, using visual illusions as a case study. One recent study suggests that people from 'carpentered' Western environments are more likely to see rectangles in an illusion, while rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly debunks this 'carpentered world' hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a neuroscientist, argues that perception is an active construction by the brain, not a direct reflection of reality, which makes perceptual diversity between and within groups not only plausible but expected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 1923, public swimming is officially permitted in the Seine River in Paris. Authorities have opened three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with changing rooms and lifeguards, as part of the legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The reopening follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve the river's water quality, which had been contaminated by pollution for decades. This project, which included building a massive underground wastewater storage tank, was a key promise of the Olympic bid and is seen as part of a broader effort to enhance the city's quality of life.</p>
