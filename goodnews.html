          <p>In an effort to boost tourism and cultural exchange, China's diplomatic missions in the United States have launched a new online visa application system. The change, effective September 30, allows applicants to submit their initial materials digitally, streamlining a process that previously required at least two in-person visits. While applicants will still need to visit a mission for biometric data collection and passport submission, the new system is expected to make travel significantly more convenient. This initiative is part of a broader push by Beijing to attract more international visitors and improve people-to-people ties between the two nations.</p>

Even Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi, remains a potential threat due to having several games in hand over their rivals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues for the implementation of the Beautifying Federal Civic Architecture Act, which codifies a Trump-era executive order favoring classical and traditional designs for new federal buildings. The author contends that modern architectural styles, particularly brutalism, are unpopular and fail to reflect American values, unlike historical landmarks such as the U.S. Capitol. Citing a poll showing broad public preference for traditional designs across political affiliations, the piece asserts that this architectural choice is not merely aesthetic but a reaffirmation of Western civilization and the nation's founding principles. The legislation also aims to increase local community input in the design process for new federal structures.</p>

          <p>Eddie Conyers, at 97 years old, remains an integral part of the University of Alabama's football program, continuing a legacy that has spanned over 60 years and a dozen national championships. Originally recruited by legendary coach Bear Bryant in 1962 to help reduce in-game penalties, Conyers has refereed practices for generations of Crimson Tide players, including Joe Namath and Mark Ingram. Although he has transitioned from an on-field role to overseeing and mentoring other officials from the sidelines this season, his joyful presence and historical connection to the team's storied past make him a beloved figure on campus. His enduring dedication serves as a living link to the program's rich history.</p>

The movie serves as a breakout role for actor Tyriq Withers, who stars opposite veteran actor Marlon Wayans. The article discusses Withers' journey from college athlete to rising star and the mentorship he received from Wayans on set. Like other films in Peele's genre of social thrillers, 'HIM' uses horror to offer a scathing critique of how professional sports can exploit the bodies and minds of Black athletes, continuing a tradition of thought-provoking commentary.</p>

          <h2>Katmai's Fat Bear Week Competition Begins Early Amid an Abundance of Salmon</h2>

          <p>The popular online competition Fat Bear Week, where the public votes for their favorite brown bear bulking up for winter, is starting earlier than usual this year on September 23. Officials at Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska attribute the early start to an extraordinary salmon run, which has left the bears well-fed and less aggressive than in previous seasons. This abundance of food has reportedly led to more playful interactions among the bears, providing a different dynamic for viewers of the park's live webcams. Fans are eagerly awaiting the bracket reveal to see past champions like 128 Grazer and 747 compete against other plump contenders.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have announced a new agreement to reform the body investigating legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to resolve a diplomatic rift. Under the deal, Ireland will pass new legislation to ensure its state bodies, including the police, fully cooperate with the UK's legacy commission, which will be renamed and given a new oversight board. The agreement also includes establishing a dedicated legacy unit within the Irish police force and a support fund for victims. This new framework seeks to replace the widely opposed Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act passed by the previous UK government.</p>

          <p>Italian driver Fabio Barone has set a new world record for the fastest speed achieved by a car on the deck of a moving boat. Racing a modified Ferrari SF90 along the 774-foot flight deck of an Italian aircraft carrier, Barone reached a top speed of 101.9 mph (164 km/h), surpassing his previous record of 94.4 mph. The attempt required immense precision, as he had to accelerate to maximum velocity and then brake in time to avoid launching off the ship's ski-jump ramp. After the official timekeeper confirmed the new record, Barone's team announced they would submit the certified result to Guinness World Records for official recognition.</p>

          <p>Apple launched its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, drawing significant crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The global release is a crucial test for the company as it faces intensified competition, particularly in China from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi, and investor questions about its artificial intelligence strategy. Early signs from preorders and launch day sales in China appear positive, with one major e-commerce platform reporting that first-minute preorders surpassed the entire first day's volume from last year's model. The successful launch of the new iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods is seen as vital for reassuring investors about the company's market position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 0.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. The decision came as new data showed Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest level since November 2024. While headline inflation remains above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the BOJ appears to be taking a cautious approach amid signs of slowing price growth and global economic uncertainty. The central bank's strategy contrasts with that of the U.S. and Europe, where rate cuts are being considered as inflation subsides. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fisher, a cat-sized member of the weasel family, is making a remarkable comeback in Ohio after being absent from the state for nearly 200 years. An increase in sightings and the discovery of the largest fisher ever recorded in the state as roadkill indicate that the population is growing and migrating from neighboring regions like Pennsylvania. Wildlife experts attribute the recovery to improved forest habitats and biodiversity, which have also supported the return of species like bald eagles and river otters. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources is studying the recovered animals to learn more about their genetics, diet, and health to support the species' continued expansion.</p>
