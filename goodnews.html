          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could provide temporary relief for Asian countries navigating the complex relationship between the U.S. and China. This detente, however, might make it more difficult for these nations to balance their trade priorities with China and the aggressive policies of the U.S. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic step forward after weeks of escalating tensions between the two global powers. Lee Seong-hyon of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations notes that while the call is a welcome development, the relationship remains fragile. This event highlights the ongoing challenges faced by countries in the region as they attempt to maintain economic ties with both superpowers.</p>

This trend reflects a broader pattern of mainland companies turning to Hong Kong for capital infusions, leveraging its established financial infrastructure and international appeal.

          <p>President Trump announced that China has agreed to restart shipments of rare earth minerals to the U.S. following a productive phone call with President Xi Jinping. This decision reverses a halt imposed by China in April, which had disrupted the supply chain for vital components used in cars, robotics, and defense systems. The agreement comes after Trump condemned China for violating an initial trade agreement and highlights ongoing economic and national security friction between the two countries. The resumption of mineral shipments could ease concerns about the impact of trade tensions on U.S. manufacturing and defense industries. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over soaring rice prices, particularly with a national election approaching. Ishiba aims to reform the decades-old production adjustment system to counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. Despite officially ending the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments have continued, and Ishiba now seeks to boost rice production while addressing potential oversupply issues. The Prime Minister's consumer-focused approach includes releasing reserve rice to lower prices. </p>
