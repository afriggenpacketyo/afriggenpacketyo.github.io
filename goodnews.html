          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated she declined an offer from US President Donald Trump to deploy American troops to Mexico to combat drug cartels, emphasizing Mexico's sovereignty and inviolability. Sheinbaum asserted that while collaboration and information sharing are welcome, the presence of the US Army would never be accepted on Mexican soil. She also mentioned urging Trump to halt weapons smuggling from the US into Mexico, which contributes significantly to cartel violence. Trump's previous rhetoric has repeatedly angered Mexicans, including accusations of Mexico being dominated by criminal cartels involved in murder, sexual assault, and torture.</p>

          <p>Residents in Boca Chica Village, Texas, are voting on incorporating the area as Starbase, a new municipality dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. The proposed city, largely populated by SpaceX employees, would establish a local government with power over planning and taxation. Nearby residents have voiced opposition, citing environmental concerns and potential restrictions on access to Boca Chica Beach. A state bill could grant Starbase officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to the beach and state park during rocket launches, a move opposed by Cameron County officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law allocating $1 billion for school vouchers, enabling over 5 million students to use state funds for private education, marking a significant win for conservatives pushing for school choice. The new law makes Texas the 16th state to offer public funds for private education to all students, with each eligible student receiving up to $10,000 annually beginning in the 2026-27 school year. Supporters argue that vouchers empower parents, while opponents contend they drain money from public schools and primarily benefit wealthier families. The law requires private school students to take standardized tests and includes audits of voucher-accepting schools.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons, apologized after describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, sparking criticism from political opponents. Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation with the "utmost seriousness" and was challenging political point-scoring around the issue, not the issue itself. The exchange occurred during a discussion about Reform UK's pledge to cut diversity and inclusion roles within councils, prompted by a question about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs. Powell stated that as a constituency MP she has dealt with horrendous cases of child exploitation.</p>

          <p>Arsenal plans to use the "anger and rage" from their recent loss to Bournemouth as motivation against PSG, focusing on improving their defense against set-pieces, which have been a significant weakness this season. Of the goals Arsenal has conceded this season, 38.7% have come from set-piece situations, the most in the English top flight. The team must score against PSG while preventing them from scoring, a difficult task given PSG's strong home record. Arsenal has struggled to maintain leads in recent games, dropping 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.</p>

The discussion follows concerns about leaders like Senator Dianne Feinstein, who remained in office despite health issues, and former President Joseph R. Biden, whose age was a campaign issue.

          <p>Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has announced his intention to retire at the end of this year, and will recommend Greg Abel as his successor. He warned that the United States should knock off its trade war and said that trade should not be a weapon, adding the United States should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. He also framed his opposition to tariffs, in part, as a matter of national security for the U.S. and its citizens.</p>

          <p>Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is facing challenges due to decreased consumer sentiment and changing eating habits, including people sharing meals and taking everything home. The diner's manager, Stanley Kallivrousis, has paused expansion plans and is finding it difficult to retain staff, with some cooks leaving for the flexibility of the gig economy. John Samuels from AlixPartners notes that companies are "scrambling" due to a potential crisis, with many expecting to raise prices. Despite the uncertainty, Kallivrousis emphasizes the diner's role as a community gathering place.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) could be back on air as early as next week after the broadcaster fell silent in March following an executive order by former US President Donald Trump. A media watchdog fighting for Voice of America's revival said the broadcaster received an email from the Department of Justice that said the network could resume broadcasts as early as next week. The executive order signed by Trump was challenged in court by media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, among others.</p>
