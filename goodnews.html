          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, aged 21, is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England in international cricket. He will lead a T20 side on a tour of Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. This appointment is a significant show of faith from England's selectors, despite Bethell's limited playing time this summer and lack of senior-level captaincy experience. The squad for the Ireland tour, as well as a preceding series against South Africa, also includes a first call-up for Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker, while fast bowler Mark Wood remains absent due to injury.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has walked back her controversial comments regarding Caitlin Clark's All-Star team, stating that her remarks were intended as a "bad joke." Following the WNBA All-Star game, Plum had noted that no members of Team Clark attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which involved wearing t-shirts demanding better pay. The comment drew backlash, especially since Clark herself wore the shirt. Speaking on a podcast, Plum expressed regret, admitting she misjudged the seriousness of the moment and was trying to lighten the mood in a press conference focused on contentious CBA negotiations.</p>

Michael Borgschulte has been appointed as its 66th superintendent, becoming the first Marine Corps officer to hold the position in the institution's 180-year history. Borgschulte, a 1991 graduate of the academy and a decorated combat veteran, previously served as Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. During the change-of-command ceremony, he emphasized his commitment to the academy's mission of developing future military leaders. He replaces Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, who became the academy's first female superintendent in January 2024 and is moving to a new role at the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>To assess their durability against natural disasters, researchers at the University of Bristol are testing 3D-printed concrete houses by subjecting them to simulated earthquake conditions on a 50-ton shaking machine. This stress testing is crucial for the emerging construction technology, which promises more rapid, affordable, and sustainable building solutions. The study aims to identify optimal design parameters, such as layer bonding and reinforcement, to improve the seismic performance of these innovative structures. The findings are expected to be vital for architects and engineers in developing future earthquake-resistant housing, particularly for post-disaster reconstruction efforts.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" environment and high operational costs as key factors. The move is the latest in a series of high-profile corporate departures from California, including companies like Tesla and Chevron. Playboy plans to be fully established in its new Florida office by next year and intends to open a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios in the area. Miami Beach officials have welcomed the relocation, which represents a strategic return to South Florida for the iconic media and lifestyle brand.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation had frozen the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program funds in February. While restarting the program, the administration has removed several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement, labor standards, and benefits for disadvantaged areas. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision and aims to implement the program more efficiently.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) appears to be roaring back to life after a three-year slowdown caused by inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle have seen their stock prices soar, fueling optimism that the IPO window is now wide open for a backlog of high-value startups. Wall Street leaders and venture capitalists are advising companies to prepare to go public, encouraged by strong investor demand and a more favorable regulatory outlook. However, some analysts warn that the market may be overheating, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in July 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon with an explanatory letter. The letter writer suspects their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for an embassy job in 1943, was the original borrower. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an estimated $900 fine.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting its new electric pickup with a promise of affordability, achieved through a minimalist, "open source" design. The basic Slate Truck is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can customize with over 100 planned accessories, or even third-party additions. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it says will remain compelling even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, with the base price potentially landing near $28,000, it will face competition from other established models, raising questions about its ability to compete on features beyond its unique, customizable platform.</p>

          <p>Shares of Salesforce rose 4% on Friday after a securities filing revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value had increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has sparked speculation on Wall Street that a new round of investor activism is imminent. Starboard was instrumental in a successful 2022-2023 campaign that pressured Salesforce to improve its profitability and efficiency, leading to a significant stock rally. The renewed interest comes as Salesforce stock has struggled in 2025 amid concerns about its growth strategy and the impact of AI on its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Georgia judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested in connection with opposition to the Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The DeKalb County judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the arrest. The defendant's attorney argued the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as "the process is the punishment." This marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges from the state.</p>
