          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss ending the war with Russia. Trump assured Zelenskyy of "very good protection" and security assistance for Ukraine but did not provide specifics, walking back a previous demand for an immediate ceasefire. The meeting, described as more cordial than their last encounter, focused on achieving a lasting peace, with both leaders expressing openness to a trilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump stated he would call Putin following the discussions with Zelenskyy and European leaders.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words in the past year, many of which originated from internet culture, social media, and Gen Z slang. Notable entries include "skibidi," a versatile term from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a playful version of delusional. Other additions reflecting modern trends are "tradwife," for women embracing traditional gender roles online, and "mouse jiggler," a device for feigning work activity in remote settings. Lexicographers note that these words are only added if they demonstrate lasting power in the English language.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey from a pre-med student to an Emmy-nominated comedian. He shared how pop culture, particularly SNL, served as a crucial tool for assimilation after his family moved from Quebec to Colorado. Yang discussed his initial resistance to portraying JD Vance on the show, the creative process behind his popular podcast "Las Culturistas," and his personal experiences as the child of Chinese immigrants. He also humorously recounted hiding his copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager, treating it like "cultural contraband."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit stemmed from false claims aired by Newsmax alleging that Dominion's equipment was used to rig the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, larger case where Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million. Despite the payment, which was disclosed in an SEC filing, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was "fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism," and did not issue an apology.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis examines the scale of U.S. support for Ukraine, finding that the total committed aid is approximately $130.6 billion, according to the Kiel Institute. This figure is significantly less than the $300 billion previously claimed by President Trump. While the U.S. is the largest single-nation donor, Europe as a whole has contributed more, committing $165.7 billion over the same period. The report clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has been a mixture of grants and loans, countering claims that only Europe's contributions were structured as repayable loans.

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has completed the signing of 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak from Liverpool. The deal is for an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons, and Doak has signed a five-year contract. The move is intended to provide the young player with more consistent first-team football after making only 10 appearances for Liverpool since 2022. This sale is part of a larger summer strategy for Liverpool, which has now brought in approximately £200 million from player sales, helping to balance their significant spending on new acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, falls on Monday, September 1st this year, marking the unofficial end of summer for many. The holiday originated from the labor movement in the late 19th century to protest harsh working conditions and advocate for workers' rights. While government offices, banks, and the postal service will be closed, most major retailers like Walmart and grocery stores are expected to remain open, though some may have limited hours. Costco is a notable exception and will be closed in observance of the holiday.</p>

The changes, which include a condensed schedule and a $1 million prize, were designed to attract big names but have drawn criticism from doubles specialists who were pushed out of the draw. While some players have expressed excitement for the high-profile pairings, others, like Jessica Pegula, have questioned the USTA's lack of consultation with athletes.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open has found that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic. Researchers found that nearly a third of people using the OTC pill had previously used no method of contraception at all, and 41% had switched from a less effective method. The study, which surveyed users of the progestin-only pill Opill, also found that those accessing it without a prescription were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas. This indicates that OTC access is reducing barriers for those who face the most significant challenges in obtaining reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to automatically use stock dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock. This strategy is a simple and effective way to harness the power of compound interest over the long term. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500's price return was 185%, but with dividends reinvested, the total cumulative return grew to 239%. While investors who need the cash for income should not reinvest, it is a powerful passive strategy for most others to build wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that while homeowners can qualify for a reverse mortgage at age 62, the best time to take one out is often later, typically in the late 60s or early 70s. The amount of equity a senior can access increases with age, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. The ideal timing also depends on individual circumstances, such as immediate income needs, long-term financial goals, and a commitment to aging in place. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool to supplement retirement income, but getting one too early can limit its long-term benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
