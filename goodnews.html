          <p>Basketball legend Nancy Lieberman has advised WNBA players to move past any jealousy and embrace rookie sensation Caitlin Clark, highlighting her role as a major driver for the league's financial future. Comparing the situation to the special attention given to icons like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, Lieberman stated that Clark is currently the best guard in the league based on her performance. She called for mutual support among the league's talented athletes, such as Angel Reese and others, to foster growth rather than internal conflict.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the nation's soft power. He stated that these organizations should focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic models, which he described as being stuck in textbooks. According to Zheng, by becoming more "self-centred" and empirically focused on Chinese policy formation and implementation, think tanks can better explain the country's practices and predict its future trajectory.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon men's final will feature a highly anticipated rematch between No. 1 Jannik Sinner and No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, just five weeks after their epic five-set French Open final. This marks the first time since the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal era that the same two men have competed in both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year. Alcaraz, the defending Wimbledon champion, is on a 24-match winning streak and narrowly defeated Sinner in Paris, while Sinner seeks his first Wimbledon title to add to his three other Grand Slam trophies.</p>

According to U.S.-based space awareness firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations and appeared to merge visually, suggesting a docking for a refueling mission. If confirmed, this would be a significant technological feat that the United States has not yet accomplished, demonstrating China's advancing capabilities in complex space operations and logistics.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a new grant system, Alexander guaranteed that upcoming announcements would focus on reducing the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption. The move is part of a broader £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways, to encourage more drivers to switch ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million at a Sotheby's auction. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. This rare artifact represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet and offers a unique opportunity for collectors to own a significant piece of another world, confirmed through analysis of its distinct chemical composition.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered a shipwreck believed to be the L.W. Crane, a vessel that sank in 1880. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping other known cultural sites when they detected the 90-foot-long, partially buried hull. The L.W. Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank over 140 years ago. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, and further investigations are underway to learn more about the wreck.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a novel method to produce sucrose, or white sugar, from methanol, which can be derived from carbon dioxide. This biotransformation process bypasses the need for traditional agriculture like growing sugar cane, offering a potential solution to both food security and environmental challenges. Published in the journal Science Bulletin, the research details a system using enzymes to convert low-carbon molecules into complex carbohydrates, including not just sucrose but also fructose and starch, contributing to carbon-neutral manufacturing.</p>
