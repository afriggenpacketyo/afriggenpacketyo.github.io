          <p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers are at odds over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. The subsidies have enabled millions to afford health insurance, with enrollment doubling since 2020. Without these tax credits, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions of Americans will be unable to afford health insurance by 2035, potentially doubling the average ACA premium. Advocates emphasize the ACA marketplaces as a safety net for gig workers and entrepreneurs, urging lawmakers to find a resolution to prevent significant financial burdens and healthcare access issues for affected individuals. </p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted in 2002 for the death of his 2-year-old daughter, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. His defense argues that his daughter's death was misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome and was instead caused by severe viral and bacterial pneumonia. The court has ordered a review of Roberson's arguments under Texas' junk science law, referencing the case of Andrew Roark, who was exonerated after a similar diagnosis was discredited. Roberson's legal team also highlights his undiagnosed autism at the time of conviction, hoping his case will set a precedent for those with developmental disabilities in the criminal justice system. </p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders responded to criticism from former NFL coach Rex Ryan, who called Sanders an "embarrassment" for his behavior. Sanders dismissed the comments as an attempt to start something, emphasizing positivity moving forward. He also addressed his silent response to teammate Dillon Gabriel being named the starting quarterback, acknowledging that his playfulness may not always be well-received. Sanders remains in a positive mental space, thankful for any role he has on the team, as he sees a "light at the end of the tunnel" amidst the quarterback situation. </p>

          <p>A near-complete skeleton discovered on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "sword dragon of Dorset". The dolphin-sized marine reptile, dating back approximately 185 million years, is the only known example of its kind and fills a crucial gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a bite to the head from a larger ichthyosaur, while malformed limb bones and teeth indicate serious injury or disease during its life. The discovery highlights the dangerous nature of life in the Mesozoic oceans and the ongoing significance of Dorset's Jurassic Coast for paleontological finds. </p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Tron franchise, "Tron: Ares," concludes with a mid-credits scene that sets the stage for future storylines, linking the film to both the original "Tron" and "Tron: Legacy". Julian Dillinger, grandson of Edward Dillinger, escapes into Dillinger Corp.'s Grid and activates his identity disc, donning a suit reminiscent of Sark from the original film, hinting at his potential return as a villain. The film also ends with Ares looking at images of Quorra from "Tron: Legacy," suggesting a possible future encounter between the two characters who originated in the Grid. The future of the franchise hinges on the box office success of "Tron: Ares". </p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has begun purchasing Argentine pesos as part of a $20 billion financial rescue plan aimed at stabilizing Argentina's currency crisis, a move praised by Argentine President Javier Milei. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the strategic importance of a stable Argentina for the Western Hemisphere. The decision has sparked debate in the U.S., with some criticizing the use of American dollars to support Argentina amidst domestic spending cuts. Bessent defended the plan, asserting it is not a bailout and that the peso is undervalued, as the country faces financial turmoil ahead of midterm elections. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>California has enacted a law making it illegal to declaw cats, a procedure lawmakers and animal advocates deem inhumane. The new law, AB 867, prohibits veterinarians from performing declawing, except in cases of medical necessity. Supporters argue that declawing is a barbaric mutilation that causes chronic pain and behavioral issues, while opponents, including the California Veterinary Medical Assn., express concerns about limiting veterinarians' scope of practice. Several cities in California have already banned declawing, and New York was the first state to implement a statewide ban in 2019. </p>
