          <p>Europe is experiencing a notable surge in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year increase recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as 72% of Chinese tourists have expressed a willingness to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is significantly higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan. The influx provides a welcome boost to Europe's tourism sector.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. Lovell was a key figure in America's space race, becoming the first person to fly to the Moon twice, though he never landed on its surface. He is famously remembered for his calm demeanor during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, when an explosion crippled the spacecraft, turning a near-catastrophe into what NASA called its "finest hour." His life marks a significant chapter in the history of exploration.</p>

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit is ending his venture into the NFL to return to rugby union, a move that has been met with enthusiasm in the rugby world. After a brief stint with the Jacksonville Jaguars, a back injury and coaching changes reportedly contributed to his decision. Former NFL player Jason Bell noted that Rees-Zammit's attempt to switch sports at the highest level was itself amazing. Experts suggest he will return to rugby as a more mature and skilled player after the once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

Wing Abby Dow describes the team's journey as climbing "Everest," an analogy reinforced by a talk from mountaineer Jo Bradshaw. Head coach John Mitchell emphasizes that the focus against France, a top-ranked opponent, is on performance rather than simply extending their winning streak. The match is seen as a vital test that will steel the team for the tougher challenges ahead in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing and exporting products made from discounted Russian crude oil. However, experts believe this move is largely symbolic and unlikely to derail negotiations for a broader EU-India free trade agreement. The article suggests that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically increase India's desire to secure a stable trade partnership with the EU. This dynamic could inadvertently benefit the EU and its goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. His long career in public service included time as a federal judge and a U.S. Navy lieutenant in two wars.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare type of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds. Previous attempts by researchers globally had failed to produce pure or large enough samples. The Chinese team was able to synthesize hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence.</p>

          <p>The choice of Alaska for the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is laden with strategic and symbolic meaning. The location serves as a geographical metaphor, a bridge between the two nations where their interests in the resource-rich and increasingly important Arctic region converge. For President Trump, the rugged Alaskan frontier provides a dramatic, theatrical stage that aligns with his brand of bold, unorthodox diplomacy. The location itself sets a tone for talks where significant geopolitical stakes are in play.</p>
