          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 08:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first half of 2025, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. This significant milestone was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of solar and wind power, which met all of the world's new electricity demand. While emerging economies like China and India led this green transition, the report noted that the US and EU saw a temporary increase in fossil fuel reliance due to factors like higher demand and unfavorable weather conditions for renewables.</p>

          <p>Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of the infant formula startup Bobbie, is working to disrupt a market long dominated by a few major players like Abbott and Reckitt. Motivated by her own frustrating experiences as a new mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 to offer higher-quality, organic products and change the conversation around feeding babies. The company gained significant traction following the 2022 nationwide formula shortage, which exposed the risks of market concentration. Bobbie focuses on a mission-driven approach, advocating for issues like paid family leave to connect with its consumer base.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their foundational research on quantum tunneling. Their work, conducted in the 1980s, has been instrumental in translating abstract quantum mechanics into practical applications, paving the way for the next generation of technology. The Nobel committee highlighted that their discoveries are crucial for developing quantum computers, secure quantum cryptography, and highly sensitive quantum sensors. The laureates' research is considered a cornerstone of modern digital technology, including components that enable devices like cellphones to function.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may find current borrowing costs more affordable due to recent declines in interest rates. A $75,000 HELOC with a 15-year term now costs approximately $712 per month, down from about $777 in August 2024 when interest rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even less expensive if the Federal Reserve continues its anticipated rate cuts later this year. This makes them a timely option for those needing financing, as borrowers can benefit from future rate drops without refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence secured a dramatic 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs with a remarkable last-minute touchdown. After leading his team to the 1-yard line with no timeouts remaining, Lawrence was stepped on and fell to the ground immediately after the snap. Instead of throwing the ball away to stop the clock, he got back up, scrambled to his left, and dove into the end zone for the go-ahead score. Lawrence later described the moment as one of "sheer panic" as he improvised the game-winning play.</p>

          <p>The number of travelers using artificial intelligence to plan or book their holidays has doubled over the past year, rising from 4% to 8%, according to UK travel association ABTA. The trend is more pronounced among younger demographics, although AI still trails far behind traditional methods like internet searches or asking friends and family for recommendations. The travel industry views the growing adoption of AI as both an opportunity and a challenge, as platforms like ChatGPT partner with booking sites to offer more integrated services. Overall holiday bookings are continuing to climb back toward pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian is preparing to launch its next-generation vehicles, the smaller R2 SUV and R3 hatchback, as it aims to reach a broader market beyond its premium R1T truck and R1S SUV. The company is navigating a challenging period of weak demand and higher costs while breaking ground on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia. Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud explained that designing the more affordable R2, expected to start around $45,000, required a "subtraction" approach to maintain the brand's ethos while reducing costs. The company's distinctive "stadium" headlights were initially controversial but have become an iconic part of its brand identity.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, received an early-stage diagnosis after persistently asking her doctors for early screening options. A breast MRI, conducted after a clear mammogram, revealed two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be invasive ductal carcinoma, despite her having no symptoms. Her oncologist stated that the early detection was critical, as the five-year survival rate for this cancer drops significantly once it spreads. Del Barrio's story underscores the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, especially as breast cancer rates rise in women under 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with insecticide can reduce malaria infections in young children by approximately 65%. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers provided 200 mothers with permethrin-soaked wraps for carrying their babies, a common practice in sub-Saharan Africa. The results were "beyond even our wildest expectations," offering a promising new tool to protect children when they are not under a bed net. The intervention, which had minimal side effects, could be a critical new strategy in the fight against a disease that kills a child under five nearly every minute.</p>
