          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, granted President Trump's request to remove the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, affirming the president's executive power over these agencies. The court's conservative majority stated that the president has the authority to remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, arguing that the decision favored the president over established precedent. The ruling also addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve, clarifying that the case does not implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tour to the Middle East, including stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, has led to significant policy announcements, potentially altering US relations in the region. Trump declared the lifting of all US sanctions on Syria, a decision that reportedly surprised senior American officials. In Doha, Trump claimed the United States was close to securing a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, indicating a willingness from Tehran to give up its stockpile of enriched uranium if certain conditions are met. This tour has triggered controversy, including discussions over Qatar's offer to provide Trump with a luxury plane.</p>

He addressed concerns about potential cuts, assuring employees that Social Security is "not going away." Bisignano also emphasized the need for the SSA to adopt a "digital-first" mindset, comparing the agency's services to those of tech giants like Amazon.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to be at their lowest level since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, with an average of $3.08 per gallon, according to GasBuddy. This is 50 cents lower than the previous year, with some states like Mississippi seeing prices as low as $2.64 per gallon. Factors contributing to the lower prices include uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, are up.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that blood and urine tests can now detect the amount of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) a person consumes. Using machine learning, scientists at the National Institutes of Health identified hundreds of metabolites that correlate with processed food intake and developed a "biomarker score" to predict UPF intake. A clinical trial involving 20 adults confirmed these findings, showing distinct metabolite changes during periods of high and zero UPF consumption. Researchers hope this method will help reduce errors in large-scale studies investigating the health risks of ultraprocessed foods.</p>

          <p>In his New York Times opinion piece, David Brooks critiques the populist narrative that blames globalization and neoliberalism for the economic struggles of American workers. Brooks contends that this narrative is historically inaccurate, arguing that wages stagnated primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the era of neoliberal globalism. He also notes that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO, and that the decline in manufacturing jobs is largely due to increased productivity, not solely foreign competition. Brooks suggests that the crucial divide in American politics is defined more by educational attainment and cultural values than income levels.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The study, which compared GLP-1 users to those on DDP-4 inhibitors, found a 7% lower risk of developing obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. The study also noted that women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death compared to those treated with DDP-4 inhibitors.

However, the analyst also expressed concerns about the company's high funding needs and business model, believing that the current level of risk and uncertainty makes the stock fairly valued at its current levels. CoreWeave stock has surged around 170% this year, mainly due to Nvidia Corp.'s backing and the robust long-term growth potential in the AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is driven by legal and practical considerations. Without ceding sovereignty, the operation of the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to potential legal challenges from UN bodies. The agreement also aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence on the islands, as the UK can now effectively veto such a move.

          <h2>Home Equity Loan Rates Drop to 2025 Low</h2>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have declined to their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.23%, according to Bankrate data. This decline contrasts with the paused federal funds rate and highlights the cost-effectiveness of home equity loans compared to personal loans and credit cards. With rates fixed, homeowners can secure this affordability while protecting against potential future rate hikes. The article suggests that homeowners may want to take advantage of this opportunity now, as HELOC rates have been increasing.</p>
