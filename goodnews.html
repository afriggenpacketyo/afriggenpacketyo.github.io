          <p>Following two days of trade talks in Geneva, the White House announced a trade deal with China, though specifics remain unclear. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng stated that substantial progress was made and an important consensus was reached, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the talks as productive. A joint statement is expected soon, detailing the agreement and establishing a consultation mechanism for future trade and economic issues. Despite previous tariff increases and warnings from companies about potential price hikes, both sides expressed a desire to avoid a trade war and resolve differences through dialogue.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline leaders to address ongoing technological and staffing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have caused significant delays and cancellations. Duffy acknowledged that similar disruptions could occur at other U.S. airports due to antiquated systems and insufficient attention to infrastructure improvements. He assured the public that air travel remains safe despite the recent outages and delays, noting his family's continued use of the airport. The secretary's proposal to modernize air traffic control and extend the retirement age for controllers requires congressional approval, though staffing cuts at the FAA have been made in recent months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's Zepbound demonstrated superior weight loss results compared to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, marking the first direct comparison of the two popular obesity drugs. Participants taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight on average than those using Wegovy over a 72-week period. While both drugs target hormones regulating appetite, Zepbound targets two hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) compared to Wegovy's focus on GLP-1 alone. Both drugs showed improvements in health markers, but access and affordability remain key challenges, though manufacturers are implementing cost-cutting programs. CVS Health announced Wegovy as the preferred option on its standard formulary, excluding Zepbound.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that framing the artificial intelligence (AI) race solely around the United States and China is a simplistic and potentially dangerous narrative. The article suggests that unbridled AI development carries immense risks, including loss of human control over autonomous weapons and manipulation by non-aligned AI. This binary narrative neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and powerful corporations that are not fully aligned with either Beijing or Washington. While AI model training and development are resource-intensive, model performance is just one part of the equation.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old woman had her bowel removed due to chronic and severe constipation, highlighting the importance of open conversations about bodily functions. Kathryn Nicklas was initially diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and prescribed laxatives, but years of constipation caused lasting damage to her pelvic organs. A leading pelvic health doctor, Julie Cornish, emphasizes early detection and simpler solutions for pelvic health problems. Nicklas now advocates for destigmatizing discussions about bowel health to encourage earlier intervention and prevent severe complications.</p>
