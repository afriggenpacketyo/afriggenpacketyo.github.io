          <p>The U.S. government's remedies trial in the Google antitrust case concerning its advertising technology is set to commence on September 22. Judge Leonie Brinkema previously ruled that Google willfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in online advertising markets by tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange. This follows a prior ruling in August that Google holds a monopoly in internet search, marking a significant antitrust decision in the tech industry. Google faces the challenge of defending itself against antitrust allegations while also competing in the rapidly evolving generative AI market against rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>

In addition to her work on "Laugh-In," Buzzi made appearances on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts and voiced characters in numerous cartoons. Buzzi considered her work on Laugh-In a joy, and remained friends with Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley throughout her life.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting Chilean authorities to issue an evacuation alert for coastal areas and a tsunami warning for areas within 185 miles of the epicenter. Waves up to 3 meters were expected in Chile and up to 1 meter in Antarctica, leading to evacuations in the affected regions. Chile's President Gabriel Boric assured that all necessary resources were available for the response. The earthquake's epicenter was located under the ocean, south of Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were suspended as a precaution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year includes $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting departments such as Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposed cuts aim to achieve significant savings, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. However, the budget also proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion for the southern border. While budget proposals are essentially wish-lists for the administration, they serve to illustrate the president's priorities and what the White House hopes is a jumping off point for negotiations with Congress.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 has achieved its longest winning streak on record, gaining more than 5% since the beginning of the year and rising by 1.25% on Friday. This rally occurs amidst global market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Analysts attribute the rise to the UK's neutral trade status, shielding it from tariffs impacting the European Union and China. Defensive stocks such as healthcare, energy, and consumer staples have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by high dividend yields. Undervaluation relative to global peers and expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England could further boost the index. (not investment advice)</p>
