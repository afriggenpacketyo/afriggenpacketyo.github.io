          <p>This article explores the ineffectiveness of social media trends that claim to quickly lower cortisol levels and reduce stress, as many of these hacks fail to address the underlying causes of stress and may even prevent individuals from seeking appropriate medical treatment. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, a technology company manager, shared her experience of trying various social media remedies like cortisol cocktails and supplements, which proved ineffective in alleviating her burnout and autoimmune condition flare-up. Experts like Professor Sir Cary Cooper emphasize that sudden body changes should be evaluated by a medical professional to rule out underlying health issues, highlighting that social media solutions often oversimplify complex problems rooted in relationships, finances, or family issues. Mindfulness and therapy are presented as more effective long-term strategies for managing stress by addressing its root causes. The author emphasizes that quick fixes don't work and can even be detrimental.</p>

Some Democrats attribute the fundraising gap to a lack of confidence in the party's direction, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support since February.
