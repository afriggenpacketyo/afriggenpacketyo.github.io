          <p>A Missouri judge has ordered an insurance company to pay Ryan Ferguson over $43 million after he was wrongfully convicted of murder in 2005 and incarcerated for nearly a decade. Ferguson's conviction was vacated in 2013 after a key witness recanted their testimony, leading prosecutors to drop the case. Ferguson then filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in 2014 and was initially awarded $11 million. The recent judgment addresses the insurer's refusal to fully compensate the officers involved, who experienced stress due to the insurer's denial to pay out, with the officers receiving a percentage of the award.</p>

          <p>Meta is reportedly hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Ilya Sutskever's AI startup Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This move follows Meta's failed attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, after Sutskever rejected the offer. Gross and Friedman will be working on products under Alexandr Wang, with Meta acquiring a stake in their venture capital firm, NFDG. The aggressive hiring tactics underscore the intense competition for AI talent among tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, as they race to develop advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from forcing 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted the states' request for an injunction, arguing that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage to coerce them into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling is a setback for the administration's efforts to pressure sanctuary jurisdictions to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p>
