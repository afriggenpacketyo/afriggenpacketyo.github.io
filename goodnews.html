          <p>The UK has seemingly found a successful approach to gaining favor with President Trump, marked by a trade deal and a seemingly instinctive connection. Trump has openly expressed his liking for the UK, citing it as their "ultimate protection" from further tariffs. The relationship between Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, despite their differing political ideologies, has been characterized by warmth and friendship. Strong cultural links, Trump's Anglophilia, and the UK's avoidance of trade and foreign policy conflicts with Washington contribute to this preferential relationship.</p>

City Hall claims that two-thirds of people support the initiative, designed to revitalize the high street and attract more visitors. Detailed proposals will be consulted on later this year, contingent on the mayor obtaining planning powers from the Deputy Prime Minister. While some business owners and residents have expressed concerns, the mayor is determined to progress with the "ambitious" plans.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted medicines that deliver chemotherapy agents directly to cancer cells, potentially replacing traditional chemotherapy for some patients. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADCs, which aim to spare healthy cells and reduce harsh side effects. While challenges remain, such as ensuring the ADC's payload reaches only the targeted cells, recent successes and ongoing research are paving the way for wider use of ADCs in cancer treatment.

          <p>Driven by concerns about the negative impacts of smartphones, some parents are turning to landlines as a way to give their children independence without the risks of social media. One mother in Maine created a landline pod in her neighborhood, encouraging other families to install home phones for their kids to connect with friends. This approach allows children to practice communication skills and arrange playdates without constant parental involvement or exposure to smartphones. Experts suggest that providing a smartphone alternative can make kids happier and better prepared for responsible technology use later in life.</p>
