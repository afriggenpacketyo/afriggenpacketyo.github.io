          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold has risen to become the world's second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing demand for the precious metal. Central banks are accumulating liquid assets like foreign currencies and gold to hedge against inflation and diversify their holdings, allowing them to support their currencies during economic stress. Gold is viewed as providing long-term value and resilience during times of volatility, with central banks now accounting for over 20% of global demand, up from around 10% in the 2010s. Despite recent market choppiness due to changing U.S. tariff policies, many analysts believe that the factors propelling gold's rally remain intact. (not investment advice) </p>

V-JEPA 2 can recognize concepts such as a ball falling off a table or an object remaining present even when hidden from view, marking a significant step towards more intuitive and responsive AI systems.

Passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be jointly conducted by officials from Gibraltar and Spain, streamlining travel procedures for those arriving in the region. This deal aims to maintain fluid border crossings and economic stability for Gibraltar after Brexit, solidifying post-Brexit relations between the UK and EU. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago in Mongolia, bridging the evolutionary gap between smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids and apex predators like the Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton, discovered in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, was initially misidentified but has now been recognized as a crucial "missing link" in the tyrannosaur family tree. Khankhuuluu weighed around 1,700 pounds and possessed teeth unsuited for crushing bone, unlike its larger descendants. This discovery is reshaping our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution, highlighting that significant scientific breakthroughs are still possible. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May indicated a 2.4% annual increase, slightly below expectations, suggesting that the impact of President Trump's tariffs has not yet significantly affected consumer prices. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.8% over the past 12 months. The lower-than-expected inflation rate was primarily driven by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, while some grocery items and housing costs saw price increases. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates until later in the year, as inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. (not investment advice) </p>
