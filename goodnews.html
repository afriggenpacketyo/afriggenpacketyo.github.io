          <p>Famed competitive eater Joey “Jaws” Chestnut is set to return to the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, aiming for his 17th title. Chestnut was absent from last year's event due to a contractual dispute involving a partnership with a plant-based food company, but he has since resolved the issue. In the women's competition, defending champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th title by consuming 33 hot dogs and buns. The annual event, a celebrated tradition held at Coney Island, draws large crowds and international competitors.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton swiftly won his second-round Wimbledon match in just 70 seconds after it was controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light. Shelton was about to serve for the match against Rinky Hijikata when play was halted, prompting frustration from players and the crowd. Returning to the court the next day, he fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to seal the victory. Shelton later downplayed the incident, finding humor in the bizarre situation and stating his only goal was to hold serve.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart's 'Blind Box' Toy Craze Faces Scrutiny from Chinese State Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 11:12:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese state media has called for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, a market dominated by the popular company Pop Mart, raising concerns about addiction among young consumers. However, analysts believe Pop Mart will be largely unaffected, as its primary demographic consists of young adults with purchasing power, not the children targeted by the proposed rules. The company's significant and growing overseas revenue, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, further insulates it from potential domestic regulatory pressures. Pop Mart also faces challenges from scalpers, counterfeits, and production delays.</p>

          <h2>Historical Analysis Compares British Martial Law in Colonial America to Modern Military Deployments</h2>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the British imposition of martial law on Boston in the 1770s and the potential use of military force in modern domestic situations. The author argues that while taxes ignited the initial conflict, it was the Coercive Acts and the military occupation of Boston that transformed resistance into a full-blown revolution. The piece serves as a historical cautionary tale, suggesting that deploying troops on home soil can provoke fear, anger, and unpredictable escalation. The Declaration of Independence itself is cited as evidence, listing grievances related to standing armies and suspended legislatures.</p>

          <p>Following the Toronto Blue Jays' four-game sweep of the New York Yankees, which vaulted them into first place in the AL East, a Blue Jays broadcaster took a celebratory shot at a Yankees announcer. The announcer, Michael Kay, had recently claimed on air that Toronto was "not a first-place team." In response, SportsNet's Jamie Campbell, holding a broom to signify the sweep, humorously noted that Kay would have to acknowledge the new standings. The Yankees have been in a significant slump, squandering a seven-game lead in the division.</p>

          <p>A security affairs specialist has proposed that the US could learn from China's "Wuhan model" to help reinvigorate its own rust-belt cities. The model involves creating integrated university-industry clusters in second-tier cities that focus on advanced manufacturing and hi-tech research. The suggestion, made by Robert Pape after a trip to China, posits that such collaboration could not only boost local US economies but also help stabilize superpower relations. This idea emerges during a period of de-escalated trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. The announcement followed MP Zarah Sultana's decision to quit the Labour Party to help co-found the new venture with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated the new party would provide a "real alternative" to a political system he described as broken. The core of the new party is expected to be formed by a small group of independent MPs who share similar views on issues like the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

His arrest is the result of collaboration between Turkish and Swedish authorities. The incident highlights Sweden's ongoing struggle with organized crime, where gang leaders often recruit young people and manage their operations remotely via social media.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is holding its 17th summit in Rio de Janeiro, aiming to strengthen cooperation within the Global South. However, the bloc's unity is being tested by the notable absence of two key leaders: Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, who is missing the summit for the first time. The forum, which recently expanded to include several new members, seeks to act as a counterweight to Western institutions like the G7. Despite its large share of the global population and GDP, BRICS has struggled to translate its economic potential into cohesive political influence.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has reached the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a commanding 6-4, 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, showcasing powerful serving and shot-making. Kartal's impressive run marks a significant milestone in her career, having been ranked outside the world's top 800 just three years ago.

          <p>Researchers have unearthed what they describe as a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals in Germany. The analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutrient-rich marrow and fat. This discovery provides further evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than once believed, demonstrating advanced planning, organizational skills, and a deep understanding of nutrition. The practice likely helped them avoid protein poisoning by supplementing their lean meat diet with essential fats.</p>

          <p>After 42 years, a man has been indicted for the murder of his former girlfriend, whose disappearance had been a cold case since 1983. Mark Sanfratello, 72, was charged after advances in DNA technology allowed investigators to identify a human skull found in 1997 as belonging to 27-year-old Teresa Peroni. Peroni was last seen with Sanfratello at a party in Selma, Oregon, before she vanished. Although her disappearance was deemed suspicious at the time, a lack of evidence prevented charges until this recent breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to create a new political party, but experts say the endeavor is exceptionally difficult. Launching a national third party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the Democratic and Republican parties. The process would also likely involve costly and time-consuming legal battles against challenges from the established parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund the effort, building a viable national party is considered a multi-year project.</p>

He was later given a restraining order, which he repeatedly breached by tweeting about Ms. Hunt, leading to his eventual imprisonment. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue the case, expressed immense relief, stating she will finally feel safe while he is incarcerated.</p>

The object, estimated to be about 12 miles wide, was spotted by a telescope in Chile and poses no threat to Earth, as its closest approach will be over 1.5 times the distance from our planet to the sun. This rare visitor from another planetary system provides scientists with an invaluable opportunity to study pristine material from elsewhere in the galaxy. As telescope technology improves, scientists expect to detect several more such interstellar objects in the coming decade.</p>
