          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals. The Hong Kong-based company ran ads on Facebook and Instagram promoting the app, prompting Meta to take legal action to stop the advertising. This lawsuit comes after multiple attempts by the CrushAI maker to circumvent Meta's ad review process, despite repeated removals for violating Meta's policies. Meta is updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove such ads, while also sharing signals about these apps with other tech companies. The lawsuit underscores Meta's commitment to protecting its community from abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a resurgence in uranium mining, driven by increasing electricity demand and a global push for cleaner energy, despite relying on imports for over 95% of its uranium. The Biden administration banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic enrichment capacity, while President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple nuclear energy capacity. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still depend on other countries for uranium. The renewed emphasis on nuclear power and bipartisan government support are key factors in this resurgence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a slide in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This is the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation at 0.99% in May, significantly below April's 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of India has relaxed monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.

          <p>Some mothers are attempting to delay their daughters' first periods, driven by concerns about the effects of chemicals and a trend toward earlier menarche. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, from 12.5 to 11.9, raising concerns about associated health risks like cardiovascular disease and certain reproductive cancers. These mothers are focusing on changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time to minimize exposure to endocrine disruptors. Experts advise caution, noting that completely avoiding these chemicals is impossible and that restricting diet could lead to unintended consequences, such as eating disorders.</p>

Despite her performance, Bueckers expressed that she could have contributed more through voice and rebounding.
