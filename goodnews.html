          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open men's finals in New York, marking his first appearance at the event in a decade. Seated in a luxury suite, his presence prompted both cheers and boos from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium when he was shown on the venue's screens. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions related to his visit, a standard practice for the organization. The visit underscores Trump's continued presence in the public sphere, drawing polarized reactions even at major non-political cultural and sporting events across the country.</p>

          <p>Retired NFL defensive star J.J. Watt made his debut as a color commentator for CBS, drawing significant attention from fans for his new, longer hairstyle. Moving away from the signature crew cut he maintained throughout his playing career, Watt's 'feathered' look became a talking point during the broadcast of the New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers game. Since retiring after the 2022 season, Watt has joined CBS Sports as an analyst and also became a minority investor in the English soccer club Burnley FC. His transition into broadcasting marks a new chapter for the three-time Defensive Player of the Year.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must be 'fully independent' of political influence, including from President Trump. Speaking on 'Face the Nation,' Hassett warned that historical examples show political control over central banks often leads to inflation and economic misery for consumers. His comments come amid ongoing pressure from the White House on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates. This reinforces the traditional view of central bank autonomy as crucial for long-term economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reunited British rock band Oasis performed a sold-out show at the Rose Bowl, delivering a concert experience centered as much on the audience's emotional participation as the band's performance. Since launching their first tour in over 15 years, the band, led by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, has inspired widespread emotional outpourings from fans singing along to classic hits. The performance was described as powerful and musically solid, but notably un-showy, emphasizing a communal catharsis among the tens of thousands of attendees. The event highlights a trend of audiences seeking large-scale, shared real-world connections through iconic music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix saw McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finish second and third, but only after a controversial team order overshadowed the race. After a slow pit stop caused by a team error dropped Norris behind his teammate, the team instructed Piastri to let him pass to restore their original running order. While Piastri initially questioned the call, both drivers publicly supported the decision afterward, emphasizing the team's principles of fairness and long-term unity. The incident highlights McLaren's unique team culture under principal Andrea Stella, which has so far prevented a hostile rivalry between its two championship-contending drivers.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and proudly liberal force in California politics for six decades, has passed away at 92. Known for his rumpled appearance, profane language, and fierce advocacy for the underprivileged, Burton was a key figure in the powerful San Francisco political machine alongside his brother, Phillip Burton, and Willie Brown. He served in the Assembly, Congress, and as the powerful State Senate President pro tem, championing causes from foster care reform to environmental protection. After overcoming a cocaine addiction that derailed his career in the 1980s, he returned to public service and later chaired the California Democratic Party, cementing its dominance in the state.</p>

Seoul expressed that the raid was lamentable, particularly given recent trade discussions between the two allies. A chartered flight is being arranged to bring the workers home once administrative procedures are complete, and officials are seeking to streamline visa access to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of government data shows that residents of Massachusetts spend more on lottery tickets per capita than any other state, with an average of $915 per year. Rhode Island follows in second place at $573 annually, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50. The report suggests that ease of access in more urbanized states may contribute to higher spending. For participating states, lottery sales can be a significant source of revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general revenue and rising as high as 3% in states like Rhode Island and West Virginia.

However, the author contends that the vast majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The larger concern, according to the article, should be the overall health of the economy and consumers' ability to absorb higher prices, which for now remains strong due to a robust labor market and high household wealth.
