          <h2>Sydney Sweeney Campaign Fuels American Eagle Meme Stock Rally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' stock surged by over 13%, positioning it as a new "meme stock," driven by high short interest and inherent brand recognition, notably a new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. This rally follows similar volatile trading for other stocks like GoPro and Krispy Kreme earlier in the week, as retail investors send specific stocks on wild rides. Sweeney's endorsement for American Eagle's denim line aligns with a growing preference for the fabric amid a boom in popularity for Western styles. The sudden surge provides a significant, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for the stock, which had tumbled around 35% so far in 2025.</p>

          <h2>ICC Convicts Two Central African Republic Militia Leaders of War Crimes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:24:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on Thursday convicted two Central African Republic militia leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The two individuals, identified as a former top football official and a militiaman nicknamed Rambo, were found guilty of leading brutal attacks on Muslim civilians during 2013 and 2014. This conviction marks a significant step towards justice for the victims of the protracted conflict in the Central African Republic. The successful prosecution underscores the international community's unwavering commitment to holding perpetrators of severe human rights abuses accountable, regardless of their position or notoriety.</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is reportedly preparing to enter the race for the open U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina, a pivotal battleground contest for the 2026 election cycle. His plans have reportedly received the blessing of the White House, indicating significant party backing. Concurrently, Democratic former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his bid next week, setting the stage for a high-profile political showdown. This coveted Senate seat is being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis, ensuring a competitive and closely watched election.</p>

          <p>A U.S. CV-22 Osprey aircraft made a precautionary landing at Hanamaki Airport in northeastern Japan after experiencing a mechanical issue mid-flight. The tilt-rotor aircraft, assigned to the 353rd Special Operations Wing, landed safely at 9:45 a.m., and no injuries or damages were reported, with commercial flight operations continuing normally. This incident marks the second Osprey landing in Japan within a week, following a previous safety inspection in Akita Prefecture. The event comes after a fatal Osprey crash off Yakushima in 2023 that grounded the fleet for months, underscoring ongoing scrutiny of the aircraft's safety record.</p>

These twin spacecraft will fly in tandem to precisely measure rapid changes in the magnetosphere, providing critical data for understanding and predicting solar energy's impact on Earth. The mission aims to enhance the safety of GPS, communication signals, power grids, and astronauts working in space. Additional small satellites on board will contribute to research on Earth's radiation budget and high-energy "killer electrons" from Van Allen belts.</p>

          <p>Mexico's government announced the dismantling of a significant criminal group tied to a major drug cartel, responsible for a widespread extortion scheme in the State of Mexico. This "Operation Liberacion" involved nearly 3,000 security personnel and resulted in eight arrests of suspected gang leaders, marking the largest operation against extortion gangs to date. The group extorted businesses and individuals across 14 municipalities, controlling labor unions in various industries. Authorities seized stolen farm and exotic animals, meat, tons of construction materials, and vehicles, signaling a major victory for law enforcement and a step towards protecting the local economy.</p>

          <p>Slovenia, a nation of just over two million people, boasts remarkable sporting success, exemplified by Tour de France star Tadej Pogacar and NBA player Luka Doncic. This achievement is attributed to a robust foundation laid in schools, where highly trained physical education teachers and small class sizes foster high physical literacy across the population. The national SLOfit program, monitoring children's physical development since 1987, also plays a crucial role in identifying talent and guiding physical activity. Additionally, the country's diverse geography and a sports culture not solely dominated by soccer contribute significantly to its athletic prowess and national self-esteem.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has launched an ambitious "24-hour economy" initiative, aiming to diversify the nation's economy and create 1.7 million jobs by tripling the operating hours of vital industries. The plan seeks to transform Ghana from an import-dependent to a self-sufficient economy, with public and private sectors collaborating on three eight-hour shifts daily. While theoretically promising for boosting GDP and employment, economists and local observers express concerns regarding the substantial $4 billion funding needed and the country's existing infrastructure challenges, such as unreliable power supply.

The initial test lineup includes items like Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and Strawberry Watermelon Refresher, starting in Wisconsin, Colorado, and surrounding areas.

These new aerogels overcome the traditional weakness of poor mechanical strength, making them highly elastic and suitable for extreme applications, such as shielding aircraft. The "2D channel-confined chemistry" method, utilizing nanoscale graphene oxide during production, allows for the derivation of hundreds of formulations, each exhibiting high elasticity. This innovation, published in Science, holds significant promise for advancing material science and engineering, particularly in high-performance applications.</p>

Corporate banking revenues dipped slightly, impacted by a "chill" in corporate activity, but overall momentum and cost discipline were highlighted.

Businesses saw profit growth and reduced turnover, with resignation rates nearing zero, indicating high employee satisfaction. Schor notes that the pace of work didn't speed up, suggesting a company-wide reorganization rather than just compressed hours.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, seeks to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as granny flats or backyard cottages. The bill would allow government-backed second mortgages, addressing the current financing gap that often limits ADU construction to wealthier households. ADUs are seen as a viable solution to boost housing supply amid a national shortage of approximately 4 million homes and provide homeowners with rental income. While the bill focuses on financing, it does not alter local zoning regulations, which remain a significant barrier to broader ADU development and affordability.</p>
