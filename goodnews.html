          <p>U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander was freed after 584 days in Hamas captivity and reunited with his family in Israel. His parents recounted the emotional moment they received the call about his release, which they attributed to the efforts of the Trump administration, specifically Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff. They described the joyous, yet exhausting, reunion at an Israeli military base, noting Edan's weakened state and the minor injuries he sustained in the tunnels. The family is now focused on supporting the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, advocating for their release and sharing Edan's experiences to offer hope to other families. The father urged for an end to the war, emphasizing the urgency of bringing all hostages home. </p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 18% in its Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use the majority of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aiming to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, CATL's focus remains on expanding in Europe and emerging regions, where EV sales penetration is still relatively low.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, the lowest in two years, as inflation concerns continue to ease. The decision aligns with economists' expectations, reflecting Australia's declining inflation rate, which recently hit a four-year low of 2.4%. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range of 2-3%, it also acknowledges economic uncertainties, including global trade tensions. Analysts predict further dovish moves from the RBA, forecasting a terminal rate of 3.1% in early 2026.</p>

The suspects, aged 55 to 77, were associated with the Sumiyoshi-kai organized crime syndicate. Japan has been cracking down on yakuza activities, making it harder for them to operate legally and leading to a decline in membership. The regulations restrict where yakuza offices can be located and limit their ability to engage in business activities.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration cut funding for PBS, Sesame Street has struck a deal with Netflix to offer new seasons and previous episodes on the streaming platform.

The deal ensures that PBS will still have access to Sesame Street episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix.

          <p>Despite the trade war with the U.S., China attracted a net capital inflow of $17.3 billion in April into its bond and equities markets. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The article suggests a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets. Analysts at the Bank of America noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are contributing to this trend.</p>
