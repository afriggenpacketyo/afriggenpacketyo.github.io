          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, estimating a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five potentially major hurricanes. The World Meteorological Organization sets the names for these storms, rotating them every six years, with deadly or costly storms having their names retired. The 2025 list includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and others, while notable retired names from previous years include Ian, Ida, and Katrina. Naming storms aids in communication and preparation efforts for meteorologists, media, and the public. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot, is refusing a pardon issued by President Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative about the events of January 6, stating that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's actions contrast with other January 6 defendants who sought to utilize their pardons in court. </p>

She emphasized the importance of letting go of external expectations and living authentically. Piper also highlighted the power and control that comes with self-acceptance and confidence, challenging the glamorization of youth. </p>
