        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices remained relatively stable after President Donald Trump indicated that Iran was interested in negotiating over its nuclear program, following a series of Israeli airstrikes. Trump told reporters that the Iranians had reached out and suggested sending a delegation to the White House for negotiations, signaling a potential shift in tone from his previous threats. Despite considering a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump stated that a negotiated settlement was still possible. Oil prices have increased by approximately 10% since Israel initiated its campaign against Iran, reflecting market sensitivity to geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Nike Skims activewear line, a collaboration with Kim Kardashian, will be launching later this year instead of the originally planned spring release due to internal production delays. The person familiar with the matter added that the delays are internal and not because of a supplier or shipping issue. Despite the setback, the relationship between Kardashian and Nike remains strong, with both parties committed to ensuring the products meet their standards before release. A new launch date has not yet been determined, but the focus remains on delivering high-quality products. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its patient approach as it assesses the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff policy. The federal funds rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, despite Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower rates. The Fed's forecast indicates some concern about a potential resurgence of inflation, with the personal consumption expenditures index expected to rise from 2.1% to 3% over the remainder of 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that tariffs would likely push up prices and weigh on economic activity, but the Fed is well-positioned to wait for more clarity before making any adjustments to its policy stance.

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its interest rates amidst expectations of increased inflation and decreased economic growth, while still indicating two potential rate reductions later in the year. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, a level that has been in place since December. The committee's closely monitored "dot plot" suggests that two rate cuts by the end of 2025 are still under consideration, although it reduced the expected future rate cuts for both 2026 and 2027. Economic projections from meeting participants pointed to further stagflationary pressures, with participants forecasting a 1.4% pace for gross domestic product in 2025 and an inflation rate of 3%.

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced that it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach while assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.

The central bank will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has remained since President Trump took office in January. The Fed also signaled it would cut rates just once in 2026, down from two cuts projected in March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection, Yeztugo (lenacapavir), for preventing HIV, a development that the company and some experts believe could significantly contribute to ending the decades-long epidemic caused by the virus. The injection has demonstrated the ability to virtually eliminate new HIV infections when taken every six months in clinical trials. The generic name of Yeztugo, lenacapavir, has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, in line with existing branded medications approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Gilead has also granted licenses to six generic manufacturers to produce and sell lower-cost versions of the injection in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain stable interest rates offers savers an opportunity to earn substantial returns on their money, particularly through certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Despite a slight decrease from previous years, interest rates remain high, especially for online CD accounts, providing a fixed rate of return. Depositing funds into a 1-year CD this June could yield hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, depending on the deposit amount and interest rate. With alternatives like high-yield savings and money market accounts utilizing variable rates, a 1-year CD could be a beneficial way to grow money in a relatively expedited timeframe.

Critics argued distinctions existed between the three asset classes, especially in a digital age. While gold and land are virtually impossible to transport, Bitcoin transcends borders, contributing to its acceptance as a digital version of gold. (not investment advice)</p>
