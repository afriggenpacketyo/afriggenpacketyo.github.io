          <h2>Elon Musk's Starbase Inches Closer to Becoming Official Texas City</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 21:26:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in South Texas overwhelmingly approved the incorporation of Starbase as an official city, fulfilling Elon Musk's long-held ambition. The area, home to SpaceX's rocket program, is located near the Mexico border and houses many of Musk's employees. The creation of Starbase raises concerns about Musk's control over the area, potentially impacting beach access and local governance. The company has stated the city status is needed to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for its residents and streamline launch operations, which requires beach closures, but critics fear the move will prioritize company interests over public access and environmental concerns.</p>
