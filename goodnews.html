          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion, amidst months of political turbulence, including an annulled presidential race due to Russian interference allegations. Dan secured 55% of the vote, emphasizing unity and change, while Simion, who initially claimed victory, attacked the EU and advocated for cutting aid to Kyiv. Simion had strong support among diaspora voters in Western Europe, including the UK, who expressed dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and sought change. Dan's victory is seen as a win for pro-EU forces in Romania. </p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached to end the New Jersey Transit strike, which halted commuter train service for three days, impacting thousands of riders. The agreement, announced by Governor Philip Murphy, is deemed fair to employees and affordable for commuters and taxpayers, with full train service expected to resume on Tuesday morning after safety inspections. The main point of contention was the engineers' demand for pay parity with other passenger railroads, with the agreement involving concessions on work rules to help cover the cost of raises. The strike, which had been estimated to cost $4 million per day, disrupted commutes and threatened economic damage to the New York area. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones at age 82. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, was discovered after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to a prostate exam. While the cancer is considered incurable at this stage, Biden's office said it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Medical experts suggest treatment will focus on controlling the disease, slowing its progression, and preserving Biden's quality of life, with hormone therapies and bone-targeted treatments likely to be employed. </p>

The three-day strike disrupted commutes for hundreds of thousands of riders, but a fair and fiscally responsible agreement has been reached.

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, a statement from his office said on Sunday. Biden, who left office in January, was diagnosed on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms. The cancer is a more aggressive form of the disease, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10. This means his illness is classified as "high-grade" and that the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options. The former president's office added that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, meaning it can likely be managed. </p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the PGA Championship by five strokes, securing his third major title with a final round of even-par 71 at Quail Hollow. Despite a shaky start, Scheffler's consistent play on the back nine allowed him to pull away from the competition, including Jon Rahm, who faltered in the final holes. With this win, Scheffler became the first player since Seve Ballesteros to win his first three majors by three shots or more. The victory marks Scheffler's 15th win on the PGA Tour, making him the third-fastest to reach that milestone behind Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. </p>
