          <p>The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 2-0 series lead. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high of 39 points, supported by Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton. The Knicks, despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points, struggled with turnovers and defensive lapses, allowing the Pacers to control the game, particularly in the fourth quarter. With the series shifting to Indiana, the Knicks face an uphill battle to overcome the deficit and secure their first NBA Finals appearance in decades.</p>

While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the initiative as a pioneering model, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national rollout, given the complexities of separating physical and mental health issues.</p>

European governments have cautioned that increased tariffs would harm both sides, advocating for negotiations as the only sustainable path forward, while maintaining readiness to respond if necessary.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who prioritized company loyalty, these individuals focus on clocking in on time and leaving promptly to pursue personal interests. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, driven by a desire for more 'me time.' This shift reflects a change in attitudes towards work, with younger generations valuing personal fulfillment and rejecting the sacrifices made by their parents.</p>
