          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a formidable linebacker who was a cornerstone of the Dallas Cowboys' famed "Doomsday" defense, has passed away at the age of 84. Jordan was instrumental in leading the team to its first Super Bowl victory during the 1971 season. A first-round draft pick in 1963 after a celebrated career at the University of Alabama, he remained a Cowboy for his entire 14-year NFL tenure, earning five Pro Bowl selections. His legacy was cemented when he became the first player inducted into the team's Ring of Honor by owner Jerry Jones, and he remains second on the franchise's all-time tackles list.</p>

          <p>A fitness method with military origins is gaining widespread popularity on social media, where influencers are promoting the use of weighted vests during walks and workouts to enhance results. The practice, known as rucking when done with a backpack, has been used for decades by soldiers and athletes to build endurance and strength. Experts note that while the trend can increase calorie burn and cardiovascular demand, it is not a replacement for traditional strength training and should be approached with caution. They advise starting with a light weight, focusing on proper posture, and consulting a medical professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing joint or back conditions.</p>

          <p>At just 18 years old, cricketer Davina Perrin delivered a historic performance, scoring a sensational 101 runs from only 43 balls in The Hundred competition. Her remarkable century, the fastest by an English woman in T20-style cricket, guided the Northern Superchargers to the final at Lord's. Perrin, a product of the ACE programme aimed at increasing Black representation in cricket, has become the first Black British woman to score a professional T20 century. Her explosive and composed innings has drawn widespread acclaim and positioned her as a future star for the England national team, with many seeing her as a role model for the next generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid evolving technology, there remains no universal standard for how much screen time is safe for children, but experts agree on precautionary principles tied to developmental stages. For infants, a "screen-free until three" approach is recommended to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised to ensure they develop crucial social skills, imagination, and a moral compass without digital interference. While acknowledging the role of digital interaction in modern life, psychologists and pediatricians stress that real-world engagement is irreplaceable for healthy cognitive and social growth, urging parents to prioritize content and co-viewing over strict time limits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, Jack Grealish has experienced a significant career resurgence, becoming a key player for his new club. After being sidelined for much of last season, Grealish has delivered back-to-back man-of-the-match performances, including providing multiple assists in consecutive games. His revitalized form is putting pressure on England manager Thomas Tuchel, who recently left the midfielder out of the national squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. With his creative prowess on full display, Grealish is making a strong case for his inclusion in England's World Cup plans next summer.</p>

The new beverage infuses a classic Astra beer with the spicy and smoky flavor of Hela's iconic curry ketchup, a staple condiment for Germany's famous Currywurst sausage. This novel creation pays homage to the local street food culture of Hamburg, where the combination of sausage and beer is a long-standing tradition. The brewery is releasing only 2,000 liters of the special edition beer, leaving it to be seen if the unusual flavor will become a new cult favorite.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven fatalities. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanding the health department's inspection capabilities to enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed an AI-enhanced stethoscope that can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. The device analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable to the human ear and uses an AI algorithm trained on data from thousands of patients to identify issues. A large-scale study in London GP surgeries found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were significantly more likely to receive an early diagnosis. Experts are calling the tool a potential "game-changer" that could lead to faster treatment and better patient outcomes, with plans for a wider rollout across the UK.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger" offers a well-made and entertaining, if somewhat sanitized, tribute to the Troma original. Directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, the film recasts the story with a more sincere emotional core and a sharper environmental message, pitting its mutant hero against a villainous pharmaceutical corporation. While the movie retains the gratuitous gore and goofy humor of its predecessor, its polished production and appealing cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood, create a disconnect from the gleefully cheap and offensive style that defined the original. The result is a diverting piece of schlock that is accessible to a broader audience.</p>

Kidjo transformed classical pieces and standards like Gershwin's "Summertime" with her powerful vocals and Swahili lyrics, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, foundation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the eligibility and rules surrounding Social Security survivor benefits for individuals whose spouse has passed away. Generally, a surviving spouse can claim these benefits if they are 60 or older (50 if disabled), or at any age if caring for the deceased's child under 16. It is not possible to collect both your own full retirement benefit and a full survivor benefit simultaneously; the Social Security Administration will pay the higher of the two amounts. A common strategy is to claim one benefit first while allowing the other to grow, potentially switching to the larger benefit later to maximize lifetime payments. (not investment advice)</p>
