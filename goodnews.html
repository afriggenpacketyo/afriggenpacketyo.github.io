          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition force in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This achievement mirrors the broader surge of far-right movements across Europe, including France's National Rally and the Brothers of Italy. Chega's rise is attributed to its strong stance against immigration and the inability of traditional parties to form stable governments. With 60 seats in the National Assembly, Chega leader Andre Ventura hailed this as a profound change in the Portuguese political system, challenging the dominance of center-right and center-left parties. The party campaigned under the slogan "Save Portugal," reflecting its nationalist agenda.</p>

          <p>Marc Marquez, an eight-time world champion, has emerged as a 2025 MotoGP title contender after overcoming a career-threatening "nightmare" involving broken bones and severe concussions. After nearly 1,000 days without a race win, Marquez left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing, a satellite Ducati team. Leading the championship standings and now racing for the factory Ducati team, Marquez has proven his ability to be fast again. He described his decision to leave Honda, despite a good salary, as a move to prove his capabilities, setting the stage for a potential ninth world title.</p>

          <p>German defense firm Renk is seeking talent from the struggling auto sector to meet rising demand driven by geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. Renk, a leader in tank gear boxes, has seen its stock rally and order book jump, prompting collaboration with the automotive industry, which faces challenges from a sluggish economy and competition. CEO Alexander Sagel and COO Emmerich Schiller are leveraging their automotive experience to hire engineers and implement efficiency-improving methods. While unions acknowledge the job creation, they caution against a singular focus on rearmament, advocating for lasting peace instead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. The court stated that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce, not the president. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but the ruling caused stock markets to rise in Asia and the U.S. dollar to gain against safe-haven currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's record-high trade surpluses with the United States are projected to gradually decrease as South Korean companies increase investments in the U.S. market, according to the Korea International Trade Association (KITA). In 2024, a significant portion of U.S. imports from South Korea consisted of intermediate goods used for direct investments. While South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.6 billion in 2024, KITA argues that this surplus is not due to unfair trade practices but rather to substitutions of Chinese products and structural changes in U.S. imports. Seoul and Washington are engaged in discussions to craft a trade package lowering tariffs.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. The automaker expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in tariff negotiations. While emphasizing that security matters and tariff talks are based on different standards, the negotiator acknowledged the possibility of including defense purchases in the discussions. Japan has requested the withdrawal of higher tariffs on key automotive components, steel, and aluminum, as well as a "reciprocal" tariff. The Trump administration has resisted completely removing the new levies, prompting Japan to consider accepting lower duty rates to reach a trade deal.</p>

          <p>California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have surprisingly helped their sales by enabling a year-round supply, fostering increased demand. Despite initial concerns, the steady influx of avocados has transformed the fruit from a specialty item to a ubiquitous offering. Avocado consumption in the United States has tripled since 2000, driven by growing interest in healthy fats. The Hass Avocado Board, funded by assessments on both domestic and imported avocados, has played a key role in marketing and nutritional research. Growers want Mexican avocados to continue flowing into the country, with robust inspections to keep out pests.</p>

          <p>Amid intensified immigration enforcement in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization, which also promotes civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. The USCIS reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade. The rise in naturalization applications is attributed to concerns about changing laws and a desire for protection against deportation. Academics note that this trend also presents an opportunity to increase Latino voter participation and counterbalance President Trump's policies in the 2026 congressional elections.</p>
