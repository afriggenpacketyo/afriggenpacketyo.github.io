          <h2>Personal Finance's Role in the Climate Crisis Examined</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the often-overlooked role of personal finance in fueling the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support fossil fuel projects. Sustainable alternatives, such as green banks and pension providers, are presented as impactful ways to lower an individual's carbon footprint. However, the lack of standards and regulation in green finance is a key challenge, as is the difficulty in precisely quantifying personal finance's contribution to fossil fuel funding. Ultimately, the article suggests that while individual actions matter, collective action through voting and demanding regulation of the financial sector is more effective. </p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University if they are barred from studying in the U.S. The university previously launched a program in 2022 to host researchers and students affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, offering research labs and accommodation free of charge. The program has accepted over 30 students and researchers as of March 2024, providing financial support, Japanese language classes, and counseling services.

          <p>LEVA, a delivery robot developed by Swiss universities, is designed to navigate tricky environments and autonomously lift and carry heavy boxes. Combining wheels and legs, LEVA can roll efficiently on smooth surfaces and walk or climb over obstacles like stairs and curbs. Using GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras, LEVA understands its surroundings and avoids obstacles. It can load and unload cargo boxes without human help, handling boxes weighing up to 187 pounds. LEVA could be used for package delivery, farming, construction, and emergency response, increasing efficiency and safety by reducing the need for manual labor.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on a personal experience as a state government official in Minnesota during the COVID-19 pandemic, where an agency mistakenly sent unemployment insurance payments to high school students. The author describes how students, a Republican senator, and the agency worked together to change the law and allow the students to keep the payments. The author argues that building back trust in government and other institutions requires investing in local institutions and taking action at the community level. This approach can drive change at the federal level and help address the country's declining trust in its basic pillars. </p>
