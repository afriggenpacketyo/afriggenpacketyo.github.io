          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained its key policy rate at 5.5%, a decision that aligned with economists' expectations following a significant rate cut in June. This move comes as India faces escalating trade tensions with the United States, with President Trump threatening higher tariffs over India's trade relationship with Russia. While the RBI noted that domestic growth remains resilient, it acknowledged that the outlook is clouded by geopolitical uncertainties and global trade disputes. The central bank has shifted its stance from "accommodative" to "neutral," indicating a more cautious, data-driven approach to future monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

He acknowledged that while he expects them to "swap paint again," he is positive it will not be deliberate. With Norris trailing Piastri by just nine points, Brown emphasized the importance of managing their relationship for the team's long-term success.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez scored two goals, leading Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory against Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty kick in the 38th minute and, after Tigres equalized, secured the win with a skillful individual goal in the second half. The result leaves the Mexican club Tigres on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the victory, LAFC's chances of progressing to the next round also remain slim due to their overall standing.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Dodgers' lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed boost to the team, which had struggled offensively during his month-long absence due to a knee injury. His comeback, which he feared might be season-ending, coincided with a broader offensive awakening for the team, as Mookie Betts broke a hitless streak and Teoscar Hernández also hit two home runs. Muncy's return is seen as a critical reinforcement for the Dodgers as they head into the later part of the season.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have established a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several of the league's media properties, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, valued at an estimated $2.2 to $2.5 billion. Under the proposed terms, ESPN would own and operate the NFL Network, integrating it into its upcoming direct-to-consumer service, and would also distribute the RedZone channel. The final agreement is still subject to negotiation, as well as approval from NFL owners and regulators.</p>

          <p>With the number of living survivors, or "hibakusha," of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings falling below 100,000, efforts are intensifying to preserve their firsthand accounts. Younger Japanese citizens, known as "successors," are taking on the role of sharing these harrowing stories to ensure the lessons of the past are not forgotten. One such successor, 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, guides foreign tourists through Hiroshima's Peace Park, sharing his own great-grandmother's story of survival and eventual death from cancer. These efforts aim to convey the reality of nuclear weapons to new generations amid growing global instability.</p>

          <h2>California to Close Norco State Prison Amid Declining Inmate Population</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 22:27:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that the state prison in Norco, Riverside County, will close in the fall of 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save California $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The future of the site, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club resort, is uncertain, though local officials hope for its restoration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among China's economists and policymakers regarding whether to set a formal target for household consumption in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that establishing a benchmark for the "household consumption rate," which was a low 39.6% of GDP in 2023, is a crucial step to strategically expand domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers contend that such a metric is not operationally feasible as a direct policy goal. This discussion is part of a broader effort by Beijing to rebalance its economy and rely more on internal consumer spending for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are optimistic that Japanese rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki could contribute to their postseason efforts after a challenging start to his MLB career. After eight underwhelming starts and a subsequent shoulder injury, Sasaki has been progressing in a throwing program and may soon begin a minor-league rehab assignment. The team is encouraged by adjustments he has made, including adding a two-seam fastball to his repertoire and improving his mechanics. While not essential to their title chances, a healthy and effective Sasaki would provide valuable pitching depth for the team's World Series defense.</p>

          <p>Meta announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, removed 6.8 million accounts associated with scams during the first six months of the year. The company stated that many of these accounts were linked to organized crime centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor for their fraudulent operations. The crackdown targets criminals who hijack accounts or add users to group chats to promote fake investment schemes. In conjunction with the announcement, WhatsApp is rolling out new features to alert users to potentially suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for natural disaster mitigation. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional authority. The judge stated that the reallocation could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that he was not convinced Congress intended for the funds to be used for other purposes, blocking the move while the case proceeds.</p>
