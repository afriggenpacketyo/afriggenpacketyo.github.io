        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier's parent company, Richemont, reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, including brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. The Swiss luxury group's revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, totaling 5.17 billion euros. While jewelry sales saw double-digit growth, the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require continued agility and discipline, but overall the company's performance was robust, and they are hopeful for the future. Optimism in the luxury goods sector remains reasonably high.</p>

          <p>TikTok is rolling out in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features aimed at young users, amidst increasing criticism and lawsuits alleging harm to users' mental health. The company began testing these features, designed to improve sleep quality, with select teens earlier this year. The meditation feature is triggered during "sleep hours" and will be turned on by default for users under 18. This initiative comes as TikTok faces public pressure and legal challenges related to its impact on young users, including allegations of being intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7% annualized contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in four quarters, according to government data. The contraction was primarily driven by weak consumer spending due to inflation and increased imports. This economic downturn coincides with the launch of Japan's economic security clearance system, raising privacy concerns. Additionally, a new law was enacted to allow preemptive defense against infrastructure cyberattacks, enhancing the government's ability to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers, reflecting efforts to bolster cybersecurity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. Archaeological evidence suggests human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago, with confirmed human presence at the southern tip of South America by 14,500 years ago. This research could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the need for regulation of artificial intelligence, particularly regarding the use of her likeness and voice by AI companies. Johansson expressed concern over the lack of boundaries in AI development, referencing a past incident where OpenAI's Chatbot sounded eerily similar to her voice. She is advocating for legislation to protect individuals from being taken advantage of by AI technology. Johansson also took legal action against an AI image-generating app for using her voice and likeness in an ad, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding her identity.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst trade tensions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors diversifying away from the U.S. due to concerns about the U.S. economy and asset performance. As the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact future inflows into Japanese markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will oblige operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. The change comes as the government rushes to establish a legal framework to counter cyberattacks after a series of threats on an airline and banks caused disruptions. This move reflects the country's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity.</p>
