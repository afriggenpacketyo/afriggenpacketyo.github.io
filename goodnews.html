        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining high, experts are weighing the advantages and disadvantages of credit card debt forgiveness for seniors. Debt forgiveness may be beneficial for seniors with high medical expenses, limited income, or no significant assets, especially if repaying debt compromises basic needs. However, it may not be wise for seniors with assets or those planning to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors are advised to explore DIY strategies like stopping credit card use and negotiating lower interest rates before considering debt forgiveness.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere soon, posing a small risk to populated areas. The spacecraft, which failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. Experts estimate that the spacecraft will likely break apart during reentry, but there is a chance that a portion of the 1,000-pound object could survive and impact the surface. The risk of the spacecraft hitting someone is considered small, but not entirely excluded.</p>

          <p>Uber reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing the company's shares to decline. The ride-hailing company's revenue grew by 14%, with gross bookings up 13% for mobility and 15% for delivery. Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, highlighted the company's push into autonomous vehicles, noting that Uber reached an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the FTC regarding its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi dismissed as a "bit of a head-scratcher."</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive option for savers. Investing in CDs allows individuals to lock in these rates for the term of the CD, providing a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Online banks often offer the most competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies such as considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs can help savers maximize their returns while managing long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Renewable energy in the U.S. has surged in the past decade, with solar, wind, and geothermal power more than tripling. This growth has reduced emissions, enhanced energy resilience, and prevented premature deaths from pollution. However, progress is threatened by the Trump administration's dismantling of climate policies, leading to the cancellation or downsizing of nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments. Market uncertainty and debates over tax credits contribute to the slowdown, despite the Inflation Reduction Act's extension of renewable energy tax credits.</p>

          <p>Former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler argues that new anti-obesity medications known as GLP-1s have revolutionized our understanding of weight loss and obesity. He emphasizes that being overweight or obese is not due to a lack of willpower but rather biology, and these drugs can help people feel full and reduce cravings. Kessler criticizes the Trump administration's decision to reject a plan to expand access to these drugs, stating that they offer a chance for people to improve their health and confront the metabolic damage caused by ultraformulated foods. He also calls for more transparent food labeling and dietary guidance for those at risk for Type 2 diabetes.</p>
