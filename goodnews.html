Governor Bob Ferguson praised the bill as a necessary step to protect families and older adults from excessive rent hikes, emphasizing that housing is a basic human need. The article also notes the governor signed nine other bills aimed at helping homeowners and renters, underscoring the state's commitment to affordable housing.</p>

          <p>AppLovin's shares experienced a significant increase in extended trading following the announcement of earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations, coupled with the sale of its mobile gaming business. The company has agreed to sell its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash and will also acquire a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot. While AppLovin's first-quarter net income rose sharply, its second-quarter sales forecast fell short of analyst predictions.
