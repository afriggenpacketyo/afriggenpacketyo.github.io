        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary in England and Wales has called for police to stop recording non-crime hate incidents, arguing that current legislation puts officers in a difficult position. Sir Andy Cooke stated that a distinction must be made between offensive speech and criminal acts, allowing for open discourse without fear of legal repercussions for expressing opinions. This recommendation follows public debate over police actions, including the controversial arrest of Graham Linehan, with the head of the Metropolitan Police echoing the need for more officer discretion and clearer laws.</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an artificial intelligence system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This AI-driven third arm can perform routine tasks such as retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, freeing up surgeons to focus on more complex aspects of a procedure. Published in the journal Science Robotics, the innovation aims to alleviate the strain on medical professionals and potentially reduce surgical wait times, addressing the growing clinical demand driven by an aging population.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is examining the complex cultural and social legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopia to solve post-war housing shortages but later became symbols of social decay and rising extremism after German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses art to explore these dualities, reflecting on themes of community, memory, and the painful transformations of the era.</p>

University leaders insist the merger is a strategic partnership, not a takeover, and that the individual identities and campuses of both institutions will be retained to serve communities across the region.</p>

It explores how, in Uganda, people of Indian heritage are widely considered African, a perspective that contrasts with the more rigid racial categories in the United States that sparked controversy over his university application. The piece highlights the long history of the Indian community in Uganda, the cultural fusion it has produced, and how Mamdani's background reflects a global identity that challenges conventional American definitions.</p>

          <p>Despite a poor run of results in the Premier League, an analysis of underlying statistics suggests that Manchester United's performances under manager Ruben Amorim have been stronger than their point tally implies. The data shows the team has created a high volume of chances while conceding relatively few, ranking among the league's more dominant sides in their last 10 games. However, significant underperformance in both scoring goals and preventing them has been the primary issue, raising questions about player quality, confidence, or simply bad luck.</p>
