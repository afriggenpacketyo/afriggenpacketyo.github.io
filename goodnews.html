          <p>AT&T has reached a proposed $177 million settlement over two major data breaches that exposed the personal information of millions of current and former customers. Those affected by a March 2024 breach can claim up to $5,000, while victims of a July 2024 breach can claim up to $2,500, with a combined potential of $7,500. Customers are being notified of their eligibility and must file a claim by November 18, 2025, providing documentation of their losses. The settlement requires final court approval, with a hearing scheduled for December 3, 2025.</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have used generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics capable of killing drug-resistant superbugs like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI designed the molecular structures of the compounds from scratch, which proved effective in laboratory and animal tests. While these potential drugs are still years away from clinical trials and require further refinement, the breakthrough could herald a new era in antibiotic discovery. The study highlights AI's potential to accelerate the fight against antimicrobial resistance, a growing global health crisis causing over a million deaths annually.</p>

          <p>A-level results in the UK revealed a slight increase in top grades (A* or A) to 28.3%, with a record number of 18-year-olds securing their first-choice university spot. This year's student cohort is considered "smaller but stronger" due to the post-pandemic return to stricter grading standards at the GCSE level. However, the data also highlights a growing regional disparity in England, with the performance gap between London and the North East widening. For the first time since 2018, boys slightly outperformed girls in achieving the highest grades.</p>

          <p>Swiss eco-adventurer Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet). The five-hour flight, which took off from Sion, Switzerland, surpassed the previous record of 9,235 meters set 15 years ago. Domjan's SolarStratos mission aims to demonstrate the potential of decarbonized aviation and eventually fly into the stratosphere using only solar power. The achievement is being hailed as a major milestone in promoting solar energy and protecting the environment, showing that sustainable flight is possible.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old pupil from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for her invention designed to help homeless individuals. She conceived of a solar-powered blanket that charges during the day to provide warmth at night. Her idea, which won a national engineering competition, was developed into a working prototype by the firm Thales, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. The recognition, a partnership with Lego, also saw Rebecca immortalized as a mini-figure, honoring her for turning imagination into real-world impact.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from the Senior Citizens League projects that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This estimate, based on recent inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase recipients saw in 2025. The annual COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration to ensure benefits keep pace with rising costs, with the official announcement expected in October. Some economists express concern that even with this adjustment, benefit payments may not be sufficient to cover the actual expenses faced by seniors if inflation trends upward.

          <p>In a break from tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Games will allow corporate sponsors to purchase naming rights for its venues. This historic agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee reverses a long-standing "clean venue" policy that prohibited commercial names on competition sites. The move is expected to generate significant additional revenue to help cover the privately funded Games' $7.1 billion budget. Existing venues like the Honda Center will be able to retain their names if their sponsors sign on as top-tier Olympic partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could complicate the decision to perform a Roth IRA conversion, according to financial experts. The legislation made lower income tax rates permanent but introduced several temporary, income-limited deductions, such as a $6,000 break for older Americans. While these new deductions create more room in lower tax brackets for conversions, incurring too much income from a conversion could reduce or eliminate eligibility for these same tax breaks. Financial planners advise a careful, multi-year analysis to determine the optimal strategy, weighing the immediate tax cost against future tax-free growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, stated that both nations are prepared to move beyond stabilizing their relationship toward more productive economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, the ambassador highlighted the potential for closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing industries through joint exploration and technology sharing. This optimistic statement follows a period of strained relations that saw Beijing impose a series of trade curbs on Australian goods, which were only lifted at the end of last year. China has remained Australia's largest trading partner for 16 consecutive years.</p>

          <p>China has marked a significant milestone in its quest for semiconductor self-sufficiency with the development of its first commercial e-beam lithography machine. Developed by a lab at Zhejiang University, the tool, named "Xizhi," uses a focused electron beam to etch circuits onto silicon wafers, a critical step in chip manufacturing. This advancement is expected to help China overcome technological bottlenecks created by U.S. export restrictions on high-tech equipment. The delivery of this domestic machine represents a key step in Beijing's intensified efforts to localize advanced chip production and bolster its R&D capabilities.</p>

          <p>General Motors' luxury brand, Cadillac, has unveiled a new concept car, the "Elevated Velocity," an all-electric crossover designed to showcase the future of its EV lineup. The vehicle features a lifted design, 24-inch wheels, and multiple performance modes, including an autonomous "elevate mode" that transforms the interior into a "recovery space." Automakers use concept cars like this to gauge consumer interest and signal future design directions, not for direct sale. The reveal comes as Cadillac aims to revive its brand with a portfolio of both electric and traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to meet evolving consumer demand.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in the final stages of securing a new six-year deal for the exclusive UK live broadcasting rights to the US Open golf championship. The broadcaster is expected to fend off competition, including a credible offer from streaming giant Netflix, to extend its current contract which expires next year. This deal would solidify Sky's dominance in UK golf broadcasting, as it already holds rights to all major tournaments. The move by Netflix indicates its growing ambition in live sports, viewing standalone events as a key strategy to attract new subscribers.</p>
