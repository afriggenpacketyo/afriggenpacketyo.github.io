          <p>The Hershey Company has named Kirk Tanner, the current CEO of Wendy's, as its new chief executive, effective August 18. Tanner will succeed Michele Buck, who is retiring after nearly two decades with the chocolate and snack giant. Tanner's appointment marks a return to the consumer packaged goods industry, following a distinguished 30-year career at PepsiCo before his tenure at Wendy's. The Hershey board praised Tanner's extensive experience in the food and beverage sector, citing his expertise in customer relations, commercial strategy, and innovation. Wendy's has appointed its CFO, Ken Cook, as interim CEO while it searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a former labor union leader who ran a competitive independent campaign in 2024, has announced he will challenge Republican U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska in 2026. Osborn is centering his new campaign on a populist message, criticizing Ricketts, a multimillionaire, as a representative of the wealthy who "bought his Senate seat." Ricketts' campaign responded by labeling Osborn as a tool of out-of-state liberal donors, a reference to the significant funding Osborn received from Democratic-leaning PACs in his previous race. Osborn maintains he will serve as a true independent and will not caucus with either party if elected.</p>

          <h2>Review: New 'Superman' Film Intentionally Evokes a Lighter, More Nostalgic Tone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:30:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review of the new "Superman" movie notes that director James Gunn has delivered a film with a much lighter and more playful tone than Zack Snyder's darker interpretations. The article suggests the film is an intentional throwback to the 1978 classic, which will likely please fans who were unhappy with the previous grim versions of the character. While the movie has a simple dramatic structure, it incorporates modern elements like social media and offers a fresh, if not groundbreaking, take on the hero. The review praises the performances of David Corenswet as Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane but finds Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor less compelling.</p>

          <p>Disneyland has announced that its popular Haunted Mansion attraction will close to the public on August 11 for its annual transformation. The temporary closure is a yearly routine that allows park staff to convert the ride into the Haunted Mansion Holiday, a seasonal overlay inspired by the film “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” This macabre makeover is a staple of the Halloween season at the resort. According to Disney officials, the attraction is scheduled to reopen on August 22, just in time for the official start of Halloween Time at the park, and the brief downtime is an expected part of the seasonal transition.</p>

          <h2>Review: New 'Superman' Movie Succeeds by Placing Hero Among Peers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:14:50 EDT</div>

          <p>This review praises the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie for its fresh and brilliant approach to the iconic character. Unlike previous films that depicted Superman as a solitary god, this version places him in a world already populated with other superheroes, which helps to define his unique, earnest altruism. The film is described as consciously sincere and lighthearted, a departure from the snark of Gunn's Marvel work and the grimness of the preceding DC films. By surrounding Superman with peers and skeptics who question his goodness, the movie effectively explores and affirms the hero's core compassionate nature for a modern audience.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five tiers of men's football in England. The legislation, reintroduced by the new Labour government, aims to protect the financial sustainability of clubs and place the interests of fans at the center of the game. The move was celebrated by campaign group Fair Game as a historic step towards a fairer future for football. However, MPs voted against a proposed amendment that would have required at least 10 Premier League matches per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between fixed rates and accessibility. This article calculates that for short-term periods, such as three to six months, a CD currently offers a slightly higher return due to elevated short-term rates. However, for longer terms like nine months to two years, a high-yield savings account could potentially earn more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, as CDs lock in a guaranteed return but restrict access to funds, while savings accounts offer flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to eliminate the long-standing rule that requires most travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. According to sources briefed on the matter, the change would end a policy that has been in place for nearly two decades. The shoe removal requirement was implemented in 2006 following the failed attempt by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," to ignite explosives hidden in his footwear in 2001. While travelers in the TSA PreCheck program are already exempt, this change would extend the convenience to the general public, enhancing the passenger experience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:57:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises homeowners to be cautious when considering a no-closing-cost home equity line of credit (HELOC). While avoiding upfront fees is appealing, these costs are often rolled into the loan via a higher interest rate or recouped through penalties if the line of credit is closed early. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying a higher rate over time is more expensive than paying closing costs upfront. Lenders also tend to have stricter credit requirements for these products, and it's crucial to read the fine print regarding prepayment penalties before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping violation after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) accepted her explanation that she was contaminated by kissing her partner. Thibus tested positive for the banned anabolic substance ostarine but argued it was transmitted through bodily fluids from her then-partner, who was using a product containing it. The court found that scientific evidence supported her claim and ruled that she bore no fault or negligence in the matter. The decision dismisses an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban for the fencer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has expanded its Prime Day sales event to four days, a move that tests consumer willingness to spend amid economic uncertainty caused by shifting tariff policies. Despite this, spending is projected to hit a record $23.8 billion, a 28% increase from last year, as shoppers hunt for deals on items like electronics before potential price hikes. While the Trump administration's tariffs on imports are designed to be paid by other countries, the costs are often passed to U.S. consumers. So far, a strong job market and retailers absorbing costs have sustained consumer spending, but this sales event could be an early indicator of future trends. (not investment advice)</p>
