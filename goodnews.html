          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, according to Freddie Mac. This rate is influenced by factors including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season. In March, sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. experienced their largest monthly decline since November 2022.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter experienced a 5% year-on-year decrease, attributed to reduced oil prices and production. The company's net income for the period ending March 31 was $26 billion, slightly exceeding analyst predictions of $25.3 billion. Aramco's free cash flow for the quarter totaled $19.2 billion, a decrease from the $22.8 billion reported in the first quarter of 2024. In March, the company announced a reduction in its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024, decreasing from $10.2 billion to $200 million, with the same figure repeated for the first quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and release the pressure to be perfect. She argues that flaws are an essential part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own shortcomings and understand the give-and-take nature of relationships. Ross challenges the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and urges society to cut mothers some slack. She emphasizes that being a good mother is enough.</p>
