          <h2>China's Exports Surge Amid Trade War, Driven by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>

          <p>New Chinese government data reveals how the ongoing trade war is reshaping global trade flows. Exports from China saw a jump last month, largely due to increased trade with Southeast Asian countries, while shipments to the United States experienced a sharp slowdown because of President Trump's tariffs. Chinese shipments to the U.S. plummeted by 21% compared to the previous year, but exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21%. The data suggests that Chinese factories are redirecting trade to ASEAN countries to circumvent tariffs and complete orders destined for the United States. Chinese financial regulators are prepared to boost domestic demand to weather the impact of the trade war, with the central bank cutting interest rates to encourage spending.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering a trade deal with the U.S. that could involve zero tariffs on certain imports like steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist stance. Recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. have seemingly prompted India to rethink its trade policies, with negotiations reportedly progressing well. Experts suggest that loosening protectionist measures and reducing regulatory burdens are crucial for India's economic growth. While some worry about the impact on domestic manufacturing, others believe that certain sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals may not be significantly affected. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, viewed as a critical test for its democratic progress and its aspirations to join the European Union. Prime Minister Edi Rama and the ruling Socialist Party are seeking a fourth consecutive term, while the opposition remains fragmented. The election is seen as a decisive moment for Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and implementing reforms necessary for EU accession. New parties have emerged, offering reformist alternatives to the traditional political landscape, while concerns persist about the influence of party leaders and the integrity of candidates under investigation for corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, driven by a notable increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. Exports jumped by 8.1% year-on-year, surpassing estimates, while imports only slightly declined by 0.2%. The surge in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations, while Indonesia and Thailand saw substantial growth in shipments from China.</p>

However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, although the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate.
