        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are heading for a mixed open on Friday as investors keenly anticipate crucial inflation data from several major regional economies and the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index. This economic backdrop follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent speech, which has significantly heightened expectations for an interest rate cut in September, with CME's FedWatch tool now indicating an approximate 85% probability. Despite a largely negative week influenced by French political drama and chip giant Nvidia's earnings, the regional Stoxx 600 index is still poised to record its first back-to-back positive month since the year began. Corporate news includes Remy Cointreau reducing its projected operating profit impact from U.S. tariffs after a new trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 02:21:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have successfully unveiled and tested a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic "Gimbal" unidentified flying object (UFO) spotted by U.S. Navy pilots in 2015. This new experimental aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design centered around an elliptical, ring-like wing that seamlessly integrates a straight central section, forming an almost toroidal closed-loop structure. Unlike most conventional drones, its four rotors are mounted at the junctions of the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements. This development, nearly a decade after the "Gimbal" footage was declassified, represents a significant shift in uncrewed flight technology, aiming to improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility.</p>

          <p>DJ Admin, Rick Jansen, is the man tasked with electrifying Max Verstappen's devoted 'Orange Army' in dedicated grandstands during Formula 1 race weekends, particularly at the Dutch Grand Prix. Jansen, a passionate F1 fan since 1994, has witnessed the sport's transformation under Liberty Media, turning race events into vibrant festivals. While Verstappen maintains a humble demeanor despite his iconic status, the DJ ensures fans are entertained with a dynamic mix of music, including popular Dutch anthems. However, the Zandvoort race is nearing its final hurrah after the 2026 event, and rising ticket prices are impacting attendance at some Verstappen stands, hinting at a potential decline in the unique fan experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered as two doses alongside the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect youngsters from the severe, though rare, complications of the varicella virus, and significantly reduce the estimated £24 million annual loss in income and productivity due to parents taking time off work. Previously, parents typically had to pay up to £200 privately for the vaccine. Health experts and pediatricians have widely welcomed the move, emphasizing that widespread vaccination will dramatically decrease the number of chickenpox cases overall, potentially making the illness "a thing of the past."</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney shared a surprising anecdote about his transfer to Manchester United, revealing that Paul Scholes personally called him while he was watching Coronation Street to ask, "Wazza, it's Scholesy… are you going to sign for us or what?" Rooney, then 18, nearly signed with Newcastle, as manager Sir Alex Ferguson initially wanted to wait another year for his recruitment. The swift transfer to United on deadline day was so unexpected that Rooney ended up wearing his wife Coleen's cousin's jumper for the official signing. He also disclosed a close call with Chelsea in 2004, which fell through because they planned to loan him to Middlesbrough, a move he emphatically rejected.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential, albeit reluctant, improvement in strained India-China relations, particularly as both nations face mounting U.S. tariffs. This marks Modi's first visit in seven years, following the deadly Galwan Valley clashes between Indian and Chinese soldiers in 2020 that soured diplomatic ties. While deep suspicion persists, economic challenges and shifting global supply chains are compelling Beijing and New Delhi towards greater cooperation. India aims to curb its widening trade deficit with China and leverage the "China Plus One" opportunity, despite its heavy reliance on Chinese raw materials and components for key industries like electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency Roscosmos is gearing up for the first test launch of its Soyuz-5 rocket in December, with plans for the vehicle to become fully operational by 2028. This medium-class launch vehicle, under development for a decade, is viewed as a reincarnation of the Ukraine-manufactured Zenit-2 rocket and will be equipped with powerful RD-171MV engines. The launch represents a significant undertaking for Roscosmos, which has faced considerable funding shortages and severed ties with the European Space Agency since the February 2022 start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The agency now plans to launch the Soyuz-5 from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, leveraging the facility to shore up its activities and maintain its presence in the global space sector.

          <p>An interactive BBC tool, playfully titled "Cooler Than Me?", invites users to compare their local weather forecast with cities across the world. The article suggests that Britain's true national sport is complaining about the weather, and this feature offers a fun way to determine if the sun truly shines brighter elsewhere or if the UK is indeed a "green and pleasant land." By allowing users to input their location and see global comparisons, the tool aims to provide engaging insights into diverse climates. It encourages public participation and perhaps even helps users identify as the BBC's next star meteorologist.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is strategically aiming for "aggressive" growth in the international cloud computing market, a push significantly fueled by the increasing global appetite for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Dowson Tong Tao-sang, CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group, highlighted that the company's overseas cloud operations have been its fastest-expanding segment, consistently achieving "high double-digit growth over the past few years." Tencent identifies substantial opportunities in bringing open-source Chinese AI models to international clients, particularly as various markets express a desire to host large language models within their own regions. This strategy underscores Tencent's commitment to leveraging its deep expertise in AI product implementation to keep pace with intense market competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff battled through tears and persistent serving woes to secure a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory against Donna Vekić, advancing to the US Open third round. The world No. 3 experienced a public emotional unravelling, including seven double faults in the first set, which led her to slump in her chair and cry into a towel. Gauff credited spotting superstar gymnast Simone Biles in the stands for providing a calming influence, thinking that if Biles could perform under pressure, so could she. Her new biomechanics coach, Gavin MacMillan, is working to rebuild her serve, and Gauff views this challenging tournament as a crucial test, believing that overcoming these difficulties will ultimately make her a tougher player.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices slid after core consumer prices in Tokyo rose at a slower pace in August, although the figure remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq also saw declines following reports of former first lady Kim Keon Hee's indictment on corruption and bribery charges. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted gains, while India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming meeting with China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit added to the regional focus.

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a distinguished former NASA scientist, has emerged as a pivotal figure in China's semiconductor industry through her company, Innoscience, which specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology. Founded in 2015, Innoscience has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the world's first company to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, propelling China to the forefront of third-generation semiconductor development. This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy given the ongoing efforts by the United States to decouple from China on cutting-edge chip technology. Innoscience's inclusion as a key supplier for Nvidia's advanced 800 VDC power architecture for next-generation AI data centers underscores its growing influence and innovative contributions to power electronics.</p>
