          <h2>Effective Communication Techniques for Parents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies five phrases that hinder cooperation and offers alternative communication strategies. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency, and validate their emotions. By shifting to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes more natural, fostering respect and emotional safety.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro injections, aimed at aiding weight loss, will be accessible at GP surgeries in England starting today, albeit with stringent eligibility criteria. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to prioritize those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. To qualify, individuals must have a BMI of 40 or higher (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and meet four out of five specific health conditions. This initiative includes comprehensive support for exercise and healthy eating habits, but availability will vary across local GPs.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, secured the most seats, indicating the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The LDP's poor performance strains Ishiba's minority government in national politics. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito party also won seats in the election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly half of all cars sold last year being electric. The Chinese government's long-term planning and significant subsidies have fueled this growth, leading to the dominance of companies like BYD and CATL. Chinese consumers are drawn to EVs due to their affordability and environmental benefits, with government support making them financially attractive. While Western countries impose import taxes on Chinese EVs, the UK remains an attractive market for these companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian in Scotland is exploring the possibility of establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be prescribed 'off-label.' Advocates believe ketamine infusions can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, but concerns remain about misuse and potential health risks.</p>

          <p>A team traveled to Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, to report on research being conducted on the island's rhesus macaque monkeys. The monkeys have been studied by scientists for over 80 years because 94% of their DNA is the same as humans. Researchers thought the monkeys would die when Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico in September of 2017. It was discovered that most of the monkeys had lived. It remains a mystery how they survived.</p>
