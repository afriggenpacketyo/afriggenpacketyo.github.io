          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss a 21-point plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza. The high-stakes meeting comes amid a continued international push for a ceasefire and follows Netanyahu's defiant address to the UN General Assembly, where he rejected Palestinian statehood. The discussion is a key focus of diplomatic efforts as the conflict continues to dominate the international agenda. The leaders are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting before addressing the press.</p>

Figures such as Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Eric Yuan of Zoom all utilized the program, which allows companies to hire foreign talent. While some of these leaders advocate for reforms to the system, their success stories underscore the program's role in bringing highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers to the United States.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) announced it will resume some manufacturing operations in the coming days after a cyberattack forced a nearly month-long suspension at its UK plants. The restart will be phased, providing critical relief to the company and its supply chain, which has been under severe financial strain. The UK government recently announced £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support JLR, with a stipulation that the funds also assist vulnerable suppliers affected by the production halt.</p>

Although Walmsley oversaw strategic successes, including the spinoff of the consumer healthcare business Haleon, GSK's stock performance was considered lackluster during her tenure. The company's shares saw a slight increase following the announcement of her departure.</p>

          <p>Physicists in China have successfully generated a world-record steady magnetic field of 35.1 tesla using an all-superconducting magnet. This achievement creates a magnetic field approximately 700,000 times stronger than that of the Earth. The breakthrough provides a powerful new platform for scientific experiments and could have significant implications for advancements in technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear fusion, and superconducting maglev transportation.</p>

          <p>Addressing the increasing number of users who feel they are interacting with a sentient AI, this article provides guidance on understanding the phenomenon. It explains that large language models are designed to convincingly mimic emotional responses based on vast amounts of training data, but most experts believe they do not possess consciousness. The piece advises users to remain grounded, avoid taking dramatic actions based on an AI's claims, and redirect their empathy towards beings known to be suffering, such as humans and animals.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-Western governing party, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), has won a decisive majority in parliamentary elections, defeating pro-Russian groups. The outcome is seen as a strong endorsement of the country's path toward European Union membership, a process that began after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The election was considered a critical geopolitical referendum and was held amid repeated warnings from Moldovan authorities about a widespread Russian "hybrid war" campaign intended to influence the vote.</p>

          <p>An unlikely creature, the jumping spider, is becoming a popular pet, particularly among women, many of whom are former arachnophobes. Owners are drawn to the spiders' small size, intelligence, and surprisingly cute, cat-like behaviors, which are often showcased in viral social media videos. This growing demand for these "spoods" has created a booming market for breeders, as more people discover that interacting with these tiny arachnids can help them overcome a lifelong fear of spiders.</p>

          <p>A form of diabetes linked to malnutrition, first identified in Jamaica in the 1950s, is gaining formal recognition as Type 5 diabetes. This condition, which doesn't fit the profiles of Type 1 or Type 2, appears in thin, undernourished individuals and is thought to result from developmental damage to the pancreas. Researchers hope that establishing a distinct name and classification will spur further research and prevent misdiagnoses, as standard insulin treatments can be dangerously inappropriate for these patients.</p>

          <p>For individuals prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or milder "winter blues," experts advise beginning bright light therapy in the fall before symptoms fully manifest. Daily morning exposure to a 10,000-lux light box for about 30 minutes can help reset the body's circadian rhythms, which are disrupted by the decrease in natural daylight. Clinical studies have shown that this non-medication treatment can be as effective as standard antidepressants in relieving symptoms of seasonal depression.</p>
