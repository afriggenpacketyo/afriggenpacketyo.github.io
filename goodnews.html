          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the bank reserve requirement ratio, aimed at bolstering the nation's economy. The moves come as China faces increasing trade worries and ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. These measures are intended to inject liquidity into the market and stabilize financial expectations amidst global economic uncertainty. The announcement follows affirmations that Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will engage in trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to address tariff and trade matters.</p>

          <p>Long Beach, California, has partnered with Throne Labs to introduce "smart" public restrooms at four locations throughout the city, aiming to address the shortage of facilities. These restrooms, accessible via QR codes and physical access cards, feature a 10-minute time limit to discourage loitering and ensure safety. The pilot program, costing $6,200 per unit per month, will be evaluated based on usage data, user experience, and cost analysis. The city hopes the initiative will provide a convenient and well-maintained solution for residents and visitors in high-traffic areas.</p>

          <h2>Trump Softens Tone on Canada During Meeting with New Prime Minister</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly cordial tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of previously critical rhetoric. Trump expressed his affection for Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his earlier remarks about potentially absorbing the country into the United States. Carney, however, firmly asserted Canada's independence, stating that it was "not for sale." The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade and diplomatic relations, but was marked by an undercurrent of tension stemming from Trump's previous comments and actions.</p>

          <h2>French Technology Could Reduce China's Reliance on Imported Aluminum Ore</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, is being implemented in a plant in Shanxi, China, to enable the production of aluminum from low-grade bauxite, which was previously unusable. This technology neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the Bayer process to efficiently refine bauxite with high silica content, the predominant ore type in China. China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, currently relies on imported aluminum ore from Guinea and Australia due to its lack of high-quality bauxite. The adoption of this technology aligns with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's continued overtures about the United States acquiring Canada during a meeting in the Oval Office. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea, despite Canada's consistent rejection of the concept. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" and that the focus should be on partnership and collaboration. The meeting, which was the first between the two leaders since Carney's election, addressed trade and other issues, with Carney also requesting that Trump cease referring to Canada as the 51st state.</p>

          <p>A Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, CEO of his company, is bypassing US middlemen and establishing direct relationships with Chinese suppliers due to trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariff issues. Therrien is sourcing goods directly from Yiwu's small-commodities market in China, seeking more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chains. He said that any business is going to have to finesse and find new ways to source products. The trade war is reshaping global supply chains, prompting companies to adapt and find alternative sourcing strategies.</p>
