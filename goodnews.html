          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a plan to temporarily host international students from Harvard University if the U.S. government restricts their enrollment. This initiative builds on a program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The program offers research facilities and accommodation at no cost, with over 30 students and researchers accepted as of March 2024. The U.S. administration's move to end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students is currently under review following a temporary injunction by a U.S. federal district court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that solutions to the nation's big problems start at the local level, citing an example from Minnesota where immigrant high school students, a union electrician, and a government official collaborated to change an unfair unemployment insurance law. The author, Steve Grove, emphasizes the importance of rebuilding trust in local institutions through actions like volunteering in local elections, supporting local businesses, and checking on neighbors. He contends that focusing on community-level initiatives can drive broader change and counteract the declining trust in national institutions. Grove, now publisher of the Minnesota Star Tribune, advocates for strong local news as essential for informed and connected communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the issue of overdiagnosis in medicine, drawing on the arguments presented in Dr. Suzanne O‚ÄôSullivan's book, "The Age of Diagnosis." It suggests that the eagerness to diagnose and screen preemptively can lead to unnecessary anxiety and treatment. O'Sullivan advocates for "slow medicine," emphasizing the importance of developing a relationship with patients, monitoring symptoms, and exercising caution before assigning a diagnosis. The article balances the benefits of advanced medical technology with the potential harms of overdiagnosis, highlighting the uncertainty inherent in many diagnoses and the need for clinical skill and careful consideration.</p>

          <p>As the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles approaches completion, George Lucas has stepped in to take a more direct role in shaping its direction. The museum has parted ways with its director and chief executive, and Lucas has appointed himself head of "content direction." This move raises questions about the museum's mission and its potential to be more than a showcase of Lucas's personal collection. The museum's opening has been delayed multiple times, and its purpose remains somewhat unclear to some observers.</p>
