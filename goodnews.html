          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Man City midfielder, Jack Grealish. There does not appear to be any way back for Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips and Maximo Perrone, who have all been out on loan this season. Guardiola signed defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis in January which could spell the end for the injury-prone duo of John Stones and Nathan Ake. One player they won't be moving for - at this stage - is Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz owning to the cost of doing a deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White remains of interest while AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders has been heavily linked, external with a move to Etihad Stadium.</p>
