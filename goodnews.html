        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England indicates a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and attendance throughout the rest of the year. According to the figures, over half of the pupils who were partially absent during the first week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize getting children in class from the start of the new term to combat ongoing attendance issues that have remained elevated since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst has decided not to run for a third term in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her decision is expected to set off a competitive race for the open seat, with Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson already planning to announce her candidacy. Ernst has held several leadership positions within the Senate Republican conference and has been a prominent voice on issues like military sexual assault prevention and federal budget cuts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. As a leader of an economic powerhouse that bridges competing ideologies, Indonesia is not tied to a single ideological camp. This unique standing allows Prabowo to champion a model of "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation in an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests. The article posits that this philosophy could serve as a potential road map for a new world order, offering a practical call to action rather than a revolutionary one.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presented as a large-scale, ambitious project he has envisioned for decades. The Netflix film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, offering a narrative split into three parts to explore the perspectives of both characters. Del Toro emphasized his desire to create a physically real world for the film, favoring practical sets over CGI to enhance actor performances. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scope and artistry, while others find it less impactful than his previous works.</p>

          <h2>Shared World War II History Explored as a Path to Improving China-US Relations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the potential for improving contemporary China-US relations by focusing on their shared history as allies during World War II. It highlights often-overlooked stories of cooperation, such as Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen downed during the conflict. As the 80th anniversary of the war's end approaches, the piece suggests that remembering this period of mutual support could provide a foundation for building better bilateral ties from the ground up. This historical perspective is presented as a potential formula for fostering goodwill and understanding in an era of heightened geopolitical tension between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued a public apology for comments made to American opponent Taylor Townsend following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend at the net, accusing her of having "no education" and "no class," reportedly over a failure to apologize for a net cord winner. In her apology, Ostapenko explained that English is not her first language and she was referring to what she perceived as poor tennis etiquette. The incident had drawn criticism, with some interpreting the remarks through a racial lens, a claim Ostapenko has denied.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a proposal to silence its 150-year-old town clock during overnight hours. The request came from the co-owner of the Wynnstay Hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors rejected the plan, arguing that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character. The clock, a local landmark, recently underwent a £55,000 restoration funded by the council, and many local residents and business owners support keeping the chimes active 24 hours a day.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," which explores themes of frustrating and lackluster romantic encounters despite her recent rise to pop superstardom. The album follows her massively successful 2024 release "Short n' Sweet" and continues her witty, candid lyrical style, set to a sound that blends '70s-era pop, disco, and country influences. The review notes that while the album may not be as consistently sharp as its predecessor, it features standout tracks and showcases Carpenter's versatile vocal performance. The controversial album cover is interpreted as a satirical commentary on the limited and disappointing dating pool available even to successful women.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt a significant blow to President Trump's trade agenda, ruling that his sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal. The court found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies, stating that the power to impose such taxes rests exclusively with Congress. The ruling affects tariffs as high as 50% on goods from countries like India and Brazil, as well as previous levies on China, Canada, and Mexico. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different law, remain unaffected by the decision.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines should align with developmental stages. For the youngest children, a "screen-free until age three" approach is recommended to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and the importance of parental supervision and interaction. Experts stress that excessive screen time can displace vital activities like social interaction and motor skill development, potentially leading to poorer language skills, but also acknowledge the role of digital media in modern social life.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who provided two assists in the team's 3-2 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been in excellent form, becoming the first Everton player to assist two or more goals in consecutive Premier League games. Moyes described Grealish as a "maverick" who is "even better than I thought," suggesting the player is thriving with more consistent game time and a need to prove himself. Grealish's resurgence at Everton comes after he was left out of the latest England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>
