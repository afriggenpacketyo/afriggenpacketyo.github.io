        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the multifaceted history of fountains, tracing their evolution from practical water sources in ancient Minoan and Roman civilizations to symbols of divine power and political prestige during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. It highlights how fountains, such as Rome's Trevi Fountain and the modern spectacles at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, have served as social hubs, religious icons, and artistic masterpieces. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, cities are now adapting these historical features, using misting technologies to provide public cooling, demonstrating the fountain's enduring relevance and utility in contemporary urban life.</p>

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart has opened its first physical store in Germany, located in Berlin, to sell its wildly popular Labubu toys. The plush monster figures, known for their toothy grins and pointed ears, have become a global phenomenon, partly due to a 'blind box' marketing strategy that adds an element of surprise for collectors. The toy's popularity has been amplified by social media trends and endorsements from celebrities like K-pop star Lisa of Blackpink. This expansion into the German market follows a massive surge in revenue for Pop Mart, driven significantly by the global demand for Labubu merchandise.</p>

          <p>Dr. Anna Chacon, a 39-year-old dermatologist, invested approximately $180,000 to become licensed to practice in all 50 U.S. states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This strategic move, inspired by her father's layoff, allowed her to build a robust telehealth practice alongside her physical office in Miami, leading to an income of over $870,000 in 2024. Despite the high cost and extensive paperwork, Chacon has no regrets, as the nationwide licensing provides her with job security and the flexibility to work from anywhere. She also emphasizes her focus on serving patients in medically underserved areas, including indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Germany is at risk of missing significant economic and geopolitical opportunities in Africa as global competitors like China, India, and the Gulf States increase their investments on the continent. German exports to the region have stagnated for a decade, failing to capitalize on Africa's dynamic growth and rising demand for infrastructure and consumer goods. Business leaders and analysts are calling for a strategic reorientation, or an "Africa turnaround," to secure access to critical raw materials and build long-term partnerships. They argue that Germany's reputation for quality and sustainable development could be a competitive advantage if supported by a coherent, ambitious government strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mental health experts highlight the challenges in diagnosing and treating depression in older adults, a condition often stigmatized or misattributed to the normal aging process. While symptoms like loneliness and lack of motivation are similar across age groups, older individuals may present with more physical, or somatic, symptoms that can be overlooked by both patients and doctors. Treatment is complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications for physical ailments. Researchers also note that older adults, especially those with suicidal thoughts or other health conditions, are frequently excluded from clinical trials, slowing progress in understanding and treating late-life depression.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the decision to be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

Macron stated the urgent priority is to stop the war in Gaza and save the civilian population, reflecting his growing frustration with the conflict. The decision was strongly condemned by Israel and the United States, who argued it rewards terrorism, while it was praised by the Palestinian Authority and other nations.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that during her early career at age 18, she would budget carefully, making $40 last for three days at a time. While driven by her passion for performing, she acknowledged the importance of financial stability and the 'security in being able to pay your bills.' A financial advisor featured in the article comments on this, suggesting that modern freelancers and artists with unpredictable incomes should focus on building a system that absorbs volatility rather than relying on extreme rationing. The advisor recommends a 'bucketing strategy,' allocating percentages of income to essentials, savings, and other categories to manage financial fluctuations effectively.</p>

          <p>Following France's announcement of its intent to recognize Palestinian statehood, this article provides context on the global diplomatic landscape. France is set to become the 148th country and the first G7 member to formally recognize Palestine, a move praised by some but strongly condemned by Israel and the U.S. Most nations worldwide already acknowledge the State of Palestine, a trend that began after the PLO's 1988 declaration of independence. While Palestine holds non-member observer status at the United Nations, full membership has been consistently blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council, despite overwhelming support in the General Assembly.</p>
