          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have partnered to allow institutional investors to purchase tokenized money market funds, recording ownership on a blockchain platform. This initiative, which has already attracted major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, aims to transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by increasing transaction efficiency and speed. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for corporations and hedge funds to manage cash. The banks believe this technology will create a real-time, always-on digital ecosystem, potentially allowing the funds to be used as collateral without first converting them to cash.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is positioning itself as a global leader by dominating the clean energy sector, particularly in the production of solar panels and electric vehicles. With renewable energy now cheaper than fossil fuels and not subject to volatile fuel prices, the nation that leads in green technology could redefine global governance. The author notes the dramatic drop in solar costs and China's integrated, high-quality supply chain make it difficult for other nations to compete. The piece concludes that China must ensure its leadership in this transformation benefits the entire world, framing it as a critical challenge and opportunity in an era of climate instability.</p>

          <p>German software company SAP, Europe's most valuable firm, has indicated that ongoing U.S. trade and tariff disputes are causing its customers, particularly in the public and manufacturing sectors, to delay large transactions. The company's CFO noted that while deals are not disappearing, approvals are taking longer due to the uncertain economic environment. Despite this, SAP expressed cautious optimism following the announcement of a U.S. trade agreement with Japan. The company reiterated its full-year outlook but reported second-quarter revenue that slightly missed forecasts, partly due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, leading to a dip in its share price.

          <p>Meta is introducing new safety features for teenage users on its platforms, including enhanced direct messaging protections on Instagram to guard against exploitative content and potential scammers. This move follows the removal of nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and an additional 500,000 linked accounts earlier this year. The updates are part of a broader effort by Meta to protect young users amid growing scrutiny from policymakers and state attorneys general over the platform's impact on children's mental health and safety. The company is also automatically placing teen accounts into its strictest privacy settings to limit contact from unknown adults.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current average interest rates for mortgages and refinancing, noting that 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.79% as of July 23, 2025. It explains that while rates are higher than in previous years, borrowers can still secure favorable terms, especially with strong credit scores in the mid-to-high 700s. The piece advises prospective homebuyers and refinancers to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and shop around with different lenders to find the best possible rates. It also suggests that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have reached a significant trade agreement that reduces tariffs on Japanese exports, including a key cut on auto tariffs from 27.5% to 15%. The deal provides much-needed certainty for Japanese businesses, potentially staving off a recession and strengthening the yen. In return, Japan has proposed a $550 billion investment in the U.S. to build resilient supply chains in sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, and it will increase purchases of American agricultural products. This agreement sets a new benchmark for other Asian economies like South Korea and Taiwan, increasing pressure on them to secure their own deals with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials made the convictions unsafe, vindicating the traders who argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then common commercial practices. Hayes, who spent over five years in prison, spoke of the devastating impact on his family, while the Serious Fraud Office announced it would not seek a retrial. This decision may pave the way for other traders convicted in the UK to have their cases overturned. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, a woman convicted in 1964 for injuring a man who sexually assaulted her. At 19, Choi bit off part of her attacker's tongue to escape and was subsequently found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm, while her aggressor received a lenient sentence for trespassing but not attempted sexual assault. Now 61 years later, inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi successfully petitioned for a retrial after her initial requests were denied. On Wednesday, prosecutors asked the court to clear her of the past conviction, marking a potentially landmark moment for victims' rights and self-defense laws in the country.</p>

          <p>Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is pushing for significant changes to Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems to curb their market power. The regulator has proposed designating the tech giants as having a "strategic market status," which would allow the CMA to enforce changes to their business practices. Key areas of concern include inconsistent app review processes, potential self-preferencing in app store rankings, and restrictive terms for developers, such as the 30% commission on in-app purchases. Proposed remedies include forcing greater transparency and fairness in app reviews and potentially allowing alternative app stores on iOS in the future. (not investment advice)</p>
