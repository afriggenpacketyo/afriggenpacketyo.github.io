          <p>Former President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the Republican primary for New Jersey governor, potentially solidifying Ciattarelli's chances. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly courted Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, given New Jersey's left-leaning tendencies and Trump's unpopularity in the state. Ciattarelli expressed his honor in receiving Trump's endorsement and emphasized the need to unite the party to win in November and address affordability and safety concerns in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A cache of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was recently discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina, arrived in 1941 aboard a Japanese steamer. Argentinian customs officials had previously warned that allowing the packages into the country without inspection could threaten Argentina's neutrality in the war. The contents of the boxes are now being scanned, digitized, and reviewed to determine what information they contain about the Holocaust and other aspects of the regime.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has responded to the Trump administration's threat to withhold federal grants, citing concerns over the handling of antisemitism on campus. Garber emphasized the university's commitment to ending bigotry and fostering freedom of thought, while criticizing the government's overreach into private universities' constitutional freedoms. He refuted claims that Harvard is a partisan institution and defended the school's efforts to address campus issues, including clarifying discipline procedures. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>The White House is exploring policies to encourage parents to stay home with their children, including increasing financial support for families and removing tax credits for day care. Republican senators are proposing measures like paying stay-at-home parents and expanding the child tax credit. While conservatives argue they are simply providing parents with a choice, studies are unclear on whether children fare better in day care or at home. Many American families require two incomes to survive, and child care costs have significantly increased, making it difficult for one parent to stay home.</p>

          <p>Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months. Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. President Trump offered "congratulations" to his family on his release. The release had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas and "the political pressure exerted by President Trump", Netanyahu said.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. believes toxic chemicals in food are behind the U.S. explosion in rates of obesity and a range of other chronic illnesses. He intends to rid the U.S. food supply of nine chemicals ‚Äî all petroleum-based, synthetic food dyes ‚Äî in as soon as 18 months. While Kennedy has faced criticism for embracing pseudoscience, concerns about chemicals in food are valid. The U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior FDA approval, and safety studies often examine single chemicals in isolation, not how they might interact with one another.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record high of $16.3 billion in April, boosted by President Trump's trade war. Customs duties totaled $16.3 billion for the month, up 86% from March and more than double the amount from a year ago. The increase in tariffs helped reduce the budget deficit for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus. However, the U.S. is still running a significant budget deficit, and high interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden.</p>
