          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has reported third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to strategic price increases and a greater focus on direct-to-consumer sales. The company successfully raised its gross margin despite higher tariff costs, with CEO Michelle Gass confirming that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand. As a result of its strong performance and successful strategies, including expanding its women's and non-denim categories, Levi's has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. This indicates confidence in navigating ongoing macroeconomic volatility while maintaining brand value and consumer loyalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix has announced its first slate of video games designed to be played on televisions, marking a significant expansion of its gaming ambitions beyond mobile devices. The initial lineup includes five party-style games such as Boggle, Pictionary, and Tetris Time Warp, which subscribers can play using their smartphones as controllers. Co-CEO Greg Peters stated that the move aims to capture a share of the $140 billion global gaming market and provide more value to Netflix subscriptions. While the company's foray into gaming has had mixed results so far, this new focus on in-home, social gaming represents a key part of its long-term entertainment strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first solo directorial effort, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the career and personal struggles of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film delves into Kerr's rise to fame in the late '90s, his subsequent battle with painkiller addiction, and the decline of his winning streak, offering a gritty, character-driven alternative to traditional sports biopics. Safdie aimed to examine the vulnerability of a champion facing failure, a theme that attracted Johnson, who sought a role to challenge his heroic on-screen persona. The movie presents an uncomfortable yet humanizing portrait of an athlete confronting his own ego and limitations.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company at the center of false election fraud claims following the 2020 U.S. election, has been sold to a new company named Liberty Vote. The acquirer was founded by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official from Missouri, who pledged to rebuild trust in American elections. Liberty Vote announced that "Dominion is gone" and that the new entity will prioritize paper-based transparency, security, and 100% American ownership and software development. The sale follows Dominion's successful multi-year legal battles against news outlets that propagated baseless conspiracies, which resulted in massive financial settlements.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced the new federal income tax brackets and standard deduction amounts for the 2026 tax year, which will apply to returns filed in 2027. The income thresholds for all tax brackets have been adjusted upwards to account for inflation, which could result in a lower tax bill for many Americans if their income does not increase at the same rate. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. The agency also increased figures for other provisions, including long-term capital gains and estate tax exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the complex journey of learning and living in a second language, moving from a forced educational requirement in Spain to a full embrace of an English-speaking identity in the United States. The author recounts the initial cultural disconnects and the gradual process of adopting a new linguistic self, used for writing, thinking, and forming relationships. The piece explores the cognitive and personal benefits of multilingualism, while also considering how emerging AI-powered translation technologies could render language learning obsolete. Ultimately, it argues that mastering a foreign language is an odyssey that creates new ways of being that technology cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman to discuss nominating him again to lead NASA. Trump had previously nominated Isaacman for the position but withdrew it after a public spat with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close associate of Isaacman. At the time, Trump cited Isaacman's Democratic political contributions and his friendship with Musk as reasons for the withdrawal. The renewed talks suggest a potential reconciliation and a second chance for Isaacman, founder of Shift4 and leader of two private spaceflights, to head the U.S. space agency.</p>

          <p>South Africa secured a remarkable comeback victory against co-hosts India in the Women's Cricket World Cup, winning by three wickets with seven balls to spare. Chasing India's total of 251, the Proteas were struggling at 81-5 before an explosive, career-best performance from all-rounder Nadine de Klerk turned the match. De Klerk smashed an unbeaten 84 from just 54 balls, including five sixes, to guide her team to an improbable win. The victory deals India its first defeat of the tournament and provides a major confidence boost for South Africa, which had suffered a heavy loss to England earlier in the competition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is proceeding with sending student loan forgiveness notices to eligible borrowers, even as a government shutdown continues. Borrowers in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan who have completed their required 20 or 25 years of payments are being notified that their debt discharge will be processed in the coming months. The action comes after the department had previously paused the relief to address court orders, sparking concern among borrowers who had fulfilled their obligations. This move ensures that long-term borrowers receive their promised debt cancellation, a key issue in ongoing debates over student loan policy.</p>
