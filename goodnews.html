        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roger Lowenstein reflects on Warren Buffett's imminent retirement, highlighting his unparalleled investment acumen and integrity within American capitalism. Buffett's long-term focus, aversion to Wall Street's chicanery, and commitment to shareholders have defined his career. His success was rooted in evaluating publicly available data, rather than privileged access, and he maintained a personal connection with those he interacted with. Buffett's role in stabilizing the financial system during the 2008 crisis underscores his irreplaceable presence as a figure of trust and stability, leaving a void as he prepares to step down at 95.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced a restructuring plan to become a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the non-profit controlling OpenAI retains its grip on the company. This decision follows criticism from figures like Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI was overly focused on profits. The new structure aims to balance commercial interests with the original mission of creating AI systems for the benefit of humanity. The non-profit will remain OpenAI‚Äôs largest shareholder, addressing concerns about shifting control to investors.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a prominent website dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support.

This shutdown comes shortly after Congress passed the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes, and requires platforms to remove such content within 48 hours of a victim's request.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway stock experienced a decline following Warren Buffett's announcement of his retirement as CEO at the end of the year. The news, revealed during Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, led to investor uncertainty about the company's future leadership. Other factors contributing to the stock's drop include missed earnings estimates and market reactions to uncertain trade policies. While Greg Abel will succeed Buffett as CEO, analysts suggest investors are adjusting to the absence of Buffett's influence.</p>

          <p>As 133 Catholic cardinals prepare to elect a successor to Pope Francis, intense secrecy surrounds the papal conclave, with all participants swearing an oath to maintain absolute confidentiality. The Sistine Chapel and guesthouses will be swept for microphones and bugs, and electronic devices will be confiscated to prevent interference. Despite official bans on communication, cardinal hunters scour Rome for insights, while voices from various quarters attempt to influence the debate through media. The election is seen as guided by God, but the hierarchy takes precautions to ensure a religious decision, not a political one.</p>
