          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and de-dollarization discussions continue, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming increasingly vital for China's yuan to achieve international prominence. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are eager to use the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools for trade and investment. This trend highlights the impact of the US trade war, prompting businesses to seek alternatives to the US dollar. China's strategy to internationalize its currency, dating back to 2008, aims to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NHS England plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to provide immediate care. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the model as pioneering, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing before national rollout. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people waiting over 12 hours in A&E, underscoring the urgency of addressing mental health service gaps.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which has since been moved. Federal air traffic controllers also reported difficulty in accurately tracking the helicopter's location. The incident heightened concerns about close calls between military and commercial aircraft, prompting the Army to temporarily pause flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to enhance safety measures.</p>

Ha believes there is growth potential in collaborating with the Japanese government in the defense sector, as few startups in Japan are willing to engage in this area. He emphasizes the critical role of AI in bolstering information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity. Ha also suggests that the increasing U.S.-centric approach could lead to AI becoming a bargaining chip, underscoring the importance of Japan's independent AI development.</p>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with alternatives as domestic rice prices reach record highs. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price than Japanese-grown rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options due to higher prices. The average price of rice sold at Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high due to a poor harvest in 2023, making the availability of foreign-grown rice a welcome option for consumers.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes from June 1, vapers are stockpiling the products, fearing changes in taste and convenience. Many ex-smokers credit disposable vapes with helping them quit cigarettes, but concerns about environmental impact and youth vaping have prompted the ban. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, while some worry the ban will lead to a return to smoking. The government aims to reduce environmental harm and cut youth vaping, though critics argue the ban may be counterproductive for public health.</p>

The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative aims to address mounting criticism that the government has failed to curb rising rice prices. The government plans to release 300,000 tons initially and may provide additional supplies if necessary. This measure is being taken as rice prices in Japanese supermarkets have reached record highs, due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>

          <p>Cuts to National Weather Service balloon sites, driven by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have left the U.S. without crucial weather data, according to some meteorologists. These cuts, including sites in Michigan and Wisconsin, have created gaps in data that could have aided in forecasting severe weather events like ice storms and tornadoes. Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar, affecting the accuracy of forecasts, warnings, and alerts.</p>
