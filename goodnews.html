President Trump will travel to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with the meeting with Xi Jinping set for next Thursday after the APEC CEO Summit. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices climbed, while South Korea's Kospi also saw a significant jump.

          <p>China's long-term energy strategy, driven by political stability, is rapidly accelerating its green energy transition, contrasting with some Western nations' pivot back to fossil fuels. The article highlights China's impressive infrastructure, such as ultra-high-voltage power lines transferring clean energy from remote regions to populous areas. Since 2021, China has increased renewable energy's share in its total installed power generation capacity from 40% to about 60%, aligning with its commitment to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This consistent, strategic approach positions China as a global leader in clean energy adoption.</p>
