          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised U.S. President Donald Trump following a meeting at the UN, after which Trump publicly shifted his stance on the war with Russia. In a notable pivot, Trump stated that Ukraine is in a position to "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a departure from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's military prospects. Zelenskyy described the change as a "big shift" and called Trump a "game changer," suggesting the U.S. president is now better informed about the battlefield situation. This development has generated cautious optimism among some Ukrainian officials, though others remain wary of Trump's unpredictability.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech giant Alibaba surged after CEO Eddie Wu announced plans to increase the company's investment in artificial intelligence beyond its existing $53 billion initiative. At the company's annual technology conference, Wu stated the goal is to position Alibaba Cloud as a "full-stack AI service provider" in preparation for the era of artificial superintelligence. The company also unveiled its latest large language model, Qwen3-Max, and plans for new data centers in Europe and Latin America. The news was met with strong investor enthusiasm, causing a significant jump in Alibaba's stock price in both Hong Kong and U.S. premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 04:07:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has announced plans requiring all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales to offer customers a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January. This move addresses concerns from low-energy users who are disproportionately affected by the fixed daily fee, which covers connection and network costs. However, these new tariffs will feature higher per-unit energy prices, meaning they are unlikely to reduce overall bills for most households. While the plan provides consumers with more choice in how they pay for fixed costs, charities argue it does not solve the underlying problem of high energy prices.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches, European golf legends and current players are outlining the strategy needed to secure a rare victory on American soil at Bethpage. Key challenges include managing the famously raucous home crowd, which captain Luke Donald is preparing his team for using virtual reality headsets. Experts like Sir Nick Faldo and Colin Montgomerie emphasize the importance of mental discipline and a strong start to quiet the partisan fans. With a largely unchanged and experienced roster from their 2023 victory, including stalwarts like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, Team Europe believes this is their best opportunity in years to overcome the home-field advantage.</p>

          <h2>European Defense Company Stocks Surge After Trump's Pro-Ukraine Remarks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 03:37:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European defense stocks experienced a significant rally following U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in tone regarding the war in Ukraine. After Trump expressed support for Ukraine's ability to win back its territory, shares of companies like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt climbed sharply. The market's positive reaction reflects investor belief that Trump's new stance could lead to increased military support and contracts for European defense firms. The gains in the defense sector stood in contrast to broader European market declines, which were influenced by concerns over high equity valuations voiced by the U.S. Federal Reserve chair.

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered nearly £500 million in fraudulent payments over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the COVID-19 pandemic, including misuse of the Bounce Back Loan scheme. The AI tool, developed by the Cabinet Office, cross-references data across government departments to identify and block fraudulent activity. Citing its success, the government now plans to license this technology to international partners, including the US and Australia, to aid in their own anti-fraud efforts.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," signaling a potential thaw in strained relations. During a meeting in Beijing, Wang emphasized that China and the U.S. should be partners, not rivals, and urged Washington to view China objectively. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is the first of its kind in six years and represents a rare moment of direct engagement between the two powers. Wang called on the U.S. to maintain the current stabilizing trend in relations and honor its political commitments regarding Taiwan.</p>

          <p>After U.S. President Donald Trump complained about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter during his visit to the United Nations, a UN spokesperson clarified that his own delegation was responsible for the incidents. The escalator reportedly stopped because a U.S. videographer inadvertently triggered a safety mechanism while running ahead of the president. Additionally, a UN official noted that the teleprompter used for Trump's speech was operated by the White House, not the UN. Trump had used the minor mishaps to characterize the global body as dysfunctional, but the explanations point to operational errors from within his team.</p>

The project aims to build a vast network of supercomputing data centers to meet the staggering and rapidly growing demand for AI capabilities, which Altman says is necessary to deliver the future of the technology. This massive investment, equivalent to the power consumption of over 13 million homes, has raised concerns about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among partners.

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a feat attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a project that was criticized at the time as wasteful but has now been vindicated. The city's resilience is being cited as a prime example of the long-term benefits of proactive investment in disaster prevention. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending can not only improve urban resilience but also serve as an effective short-term economic stimulus.</p>

In his ruling, the judge stated that the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of its actions and to deter it from appeasing lobby groups at the expense of its employees' rights.
