          <p>Japan's exports rebounded in September with a 4.2% year-on-year increase, snapping four months of declines, primarily fueled by strong shipments to Asia. Despite this overall growth, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, experienced a significant 13.3% drop, particularly impacting auto shipments, even after a trade deal reduced tariffs. This article highlights that semiconductor exports were a key driver for the overall positive trend, while imports also saw a notable increase. The economic data coincides with Sanae Takaichi assuming office as Japan's first female prime minister, whose anticipated loose monetary policy is expected to weaken the yen and potentially boost exports.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner, currently in Israel, expressed cautious optimism that the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire is progressing "better than I expected," despite recent violent flare-ups. The article highlights incremental advancements, including the exchange of hostage remains and Palestinian bodies, with all 20 living Israeli hostages now released. Significant challenges persist, particularly concerning Hamas's demilitarization and the recovery of all deceased hostages, some buried under rubble. However, skepticism from former Israeli officials casts doubt on the long-term viability of President Trump's peace plan, suggesting Prime Minister Netanyahu may have been pressured into the agreement and could resume offensive operations.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Four Common Myths About Hair Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Haircare experts have debunked four prevalent myths surrounding hair health, emphasizing that genuine care stems from fundamental practices rather than costly products or complex routines. This article clarifies that washing hair in cold water offers no additional shine, and critically, no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which necessitate a trim. Furthermore, the notion of hair "self-cleaning" is false, as regular washing is crucial to prevent the accumulation of oil, dirt, and bacteria that can worsen scalp conditions. Finally, dry shampoo is deemed suitable for single-day use between washes but should never be a long-term substitute for proper cleansing to avoid scalp irritation.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles diverted to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in one of the multilayer windshields, with a weather balloon now suspected as the cause. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, and WindBorne Systems, the company owning the balloon, believes one of its devices struck the aircraft. This article highlights that the windshield is designed to remain functional even with damaged layers, ensuring the safe landing of all 134 passengers and six crew members. WindBorne Systems has since deployed a software change to minimize the time its balloons spend at active flight levels, cooperating fully with authorities.</p>
