          <p>Emerging markets are gaining traction as the next potential bull market, fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, rising U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed bullish sentiments, with JPMorgan upgrading emerging market equities due to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. Recent selloffs in U.S. Treasuries, equities, and the greenback, exacerbated by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, have further bolstered confidence in emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a potential shift in investment focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are pressing the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of misleading passengers and causing confusion at check-ins with unfair hand baggage practices. They claim that additional charges for hand baggage breach EU consumer law, with passengers potentially paying up to ‚Ç¨280 extra. The groups are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the illegal practices and advocating for a standard luggage allowance within the ticket purchase.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues during bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgment suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy, while Japan continues to oppose additional tariffs. Both countries aim to strike a mutually beneficial deal, focusing on tariffs introduced during Trump's second term, including those targeting the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Some Afrikaners are disputing claims of a 'white genocide' in South Africa, stating that the narrative is untrue. The Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaner asylum applicants, citing violence and discrimination. However, Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp argues that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein says that while violent attacks on farmers do occur, racial motives are not generally a factor, and he doesn't believe a white genocide is happening.</p>
