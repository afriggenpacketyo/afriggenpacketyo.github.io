          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report projects that tariffs implemented by President Trump could reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over a decade, leading to a total deficit reduction of $4.0 trillion. This article, an opinion piece, challenges traditional free-trade economists to reconsider their stance, given that inflation has not spiked and growth has not plummeted. It also raises questions about the extent of presidential executive authority to impose such tariffs, noting a pending legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court. The piece suggests that while tariffs are a tax, their strategic use might promote freer trade.</p>

          <p>China has launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing the world's most powerful detector for neutrinos, often called "ghost particles." The massive facility features a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector, 700 meters underground, designed to measure the mass of different neutrino types from nearby nuclear power plants. This international project, proposed in 2008 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has now begun collecting data, marking a significant milestone in particle physics research.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed frustration with Newcastle United's defensive and time-wasting tactics following his side's dramatic 3-2 win. The match saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, despite Newcastle playing with 10 men and coming back from a two-goal deficit. Slot noted that the ball was in play for a remarkably low 40.8% of the match, attributing the game's nature to excessive set-pieces and long throws rather than tactical football. The article also mentions the feisty atmosphere, fueled by transfer rumors and a red card.</p>

          <p>China plans to expand its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, demonstrating its commitment to climate targets. The new guidelines will introduce absolute limits on emissions, a stricter standard than the current carbon intensity-based caps. This move is expected to boost demand in the often-sluggish carbon market and lead to a more aggressive emissions pathway for China, the world's largest carbon polluter. Steel, aluminum, and cement industries will be added this year under less stringent initial rules.</p>
