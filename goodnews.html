          <p>Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Spanish Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for causing a collision. Verstappen's car wobbled after a restart, leading to contact with Charles Leclerc and later with George Russell, resulting in the penalty. Stewards determined that Verstappen accelerated suddenly and collided with Russell, leading to three penalty points on his license. Piastri's win extends his championship lead over Norris by 10 points, while Verstappen trails by 49 points after an eventful race. </p>

          <p>FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary addressed concerns about a new COVID variant circulating in Asia, suggesting it behaves like a common cold virus with cross-immunity protection from previous strains. He clarified the CDC's updated recommendations on COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, emphasizing shared clinical decision-making between patients and doctors. Dr. Makary expressed skepticism about blanket recommendations for repeat boosters without sufficient clinical data, advocating for an evidence-based approach. He also questioned the reliability of CDC data regarding COVID hospitalizations, suggesting it may include false positives from incidental testing, advocating for more transparency and randomized control trials before making universal recommendations. Optimism that the current COVID situation is stable and being appropriately addressed is reflected in the careful considerations being made. </p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain are the champions of Europe - first-time winners after thrashing Inter Milan 5-0 in the most one-sided final of the competition's history. They are the first French side to win the coveted prize since Marseille in 1993 and only the 24th different club to lift the famous trophy. The new Champions League format involves more teams - 36 in the competition proper instead of 32 under the old format - while the new league phase offers fans more games, more goals and a chance to see European heavyweights play one another more frequently. It was introduced following the collapse of a new European Super League (ESL), as most of the teams involved withdrew after a backlash led by fans. But is the new-look Champions League a European Super League in all but name?</p>

          <p>Faith Salie reflects on the U.S. Treasury's decision to cease making new pennies, highlighting the coin's historical and cultural significance. Despite the penny's inefficiency and the fact that it costs more to produce than it is worth, Salie argues that it holds sentimental value. She notes that the first penny featured Lady Liberty and that Lincoln's profile was designed by an immigrant. Salie suggests that while phasing out the penny might make sense economically, its loss represents more than what can be calculated. </p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton criticized President Trump's actions attacking the rule of law, and predicted that the president would pay a price among those who believe his actions are un-American. Clinton said opposition to Mr. Trump would be bolstered if Democrats win governors' races at play this year, and win back the House in 2026. He added that the courts are stopping the president, "including a lot of judges he appointed. And you know, he is looking for ways to basically defy all these court orders. </p>
