        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones publicly blamed two-time All-Pro defensive end Micah Parsons' agent, David Mulugheta, for the ongoing impasse in contract negotiations. Jones claimed the team had reached an agreement on terms, amount, and guarantees directly with Parsons, only for the agent to instruct them to "stick it up our a--." Parsons, entering the final season of his rookie contract, is reportedly seeking a new deal averaging $40 million, with Jones asserting his offer would have made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Despite this public fallout and Parsons' prior trade request, first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer expressed optimism that Parsons would be on the field for the season opener.</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has secured its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation to commence testing self-driving cars in New York City. This initiative marks the city's inaugural autonomous vehicle testing launch, with Waymo planning to deploy up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn until late September, potentially extending the program. Crucially, New York state law requires a trained human driver to be present behind the wheel during these operations. This expansion follows Waymo's recent launches in other major U.S. cities and reflects its strategic push to introduce its robotaxi services and advanced technology into key Northeast markets.</p>

          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has indicated that its newly released large language model, V3.1, is designed for compatibility with China’s upcoming “next generation” homegrown AI chips. The company specified that the model's "UE8M0 FP8" precision format is tailored for these domestic processors, signaling a strategic alignment with China's burgeoning AI chip ecosystem amidst tightening US semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's drive for technological self-sufficiency. DeepSeek previously demonstrated advanced capabilities with its R1 reasoning model, even while using less advanced Nvidia chips due to US controls. This move could further bolster China's domestic AI infrastructure and reduce reliance on foreign technology.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that economic conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," hinting at potential interest rate cuts while underscoring the Fed's careful approach. Speaking at the Jackson Hole economic forum, Powell described a "challenging situation" marked by the dual risks of a slowing labor market and rising inflation, partly attributed to tariffs. He reiterated the critical importance of the Fed's independence from political pressure, including President Trump's repeated demands for aggressive rate cuts. Powell's remarks, which prompted a significant rally in stock markets, also touched on the Fed's policy framework review, acknowledging lessons learned from the "painful reminder" of high inflation post-2020 strategy changes.

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo's future is uncertain following a reported breakdown in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Despite successfully guiding the team to European qualification last season and securing an opening-day win, sources suggest Nuno's position is precarious, with the playing squad reportedly aware of the situation. Nuno publicly acknowledged that his relationship with Marinakis "has changed" and they are "not as close," also voicing concerns over the club's summer transfer activity and his perceived lack of involvement in recruitment decisions. This ongoing tension follows a prior incident where Marinakis reportedly confronted Nuno on the pitch after a match.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which had published a series of articles in 2021 detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that The Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judge explicitly found Clarke to be "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejected his assertion of an "unlawful conspiracy," noting that over 20 women provided testimony against him. The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a "deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a landmark for investigative journalism, hoping it empowers other victims to come forward.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments (TI) is undertaking a $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in the U.S., which will include Apple producing "critical foundation semiconductors" for iPhones. This commitment from Apple, part of its expanded $600 billion U.S. spending plan, aligns with the Trump administration's push for domestic chip manufacturing. TI's new fabs in Utah and Texas aim to quintuple its capacity, focusing on essential analog and embedded chips (45-130 nanometers), which are crucial for numerous devices, from smartphones to AI GPUs. Despite recent stock dips due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see TI as a potential "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank has asserted that the club is exclusively interested in signing players who demonstrate full commitment to joining and representing them, amidst the ongoing transfer saga involving Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze. Eze, who was initially expected to move to Spurs, is now reportedly close to joining rivals Arsenal in a £67.5 million deal. This development represents the second transfer setback for Tottenham this summer, following Morgan Gibbs-White's decision to extend his contract with Nottingham Forest despite Spurs activating a release clause. Frank's remarks highlight the club's firm philosophy of prioritizing player dedication and loyalty in its recruitment strategy.</p>

          <p>Conservation biologists have successfully transformed the Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida into a thriving sanctuary for the threatened red-cockaded woodpecker. Through translocation efforts between 1998 and 2016, 54 woodpeckers were moved to the 106,000-acre military training site, which provides an ideal habitat despite occasional bombing exercises. Researchers found that approximately 70% of relocated birds survived, forming breeding pairs and producing offspring with stronger survival rates, significantly boosting the population's numbers and genetic diversity. This success demonstrates the potential of translocation combined with habitat management, offering hope for other imperiled species and contributing to the woodpecker's reclassification from endangered to threatened.</p>

          <p>Major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are largely managing the impact of President Trump's tariffs, preventing widespread price hikes, though some costs are being passed on to consumers. Retail executives report steady, yet selective, consumer spending, with notable acceleration in sales of private label items and fashion. Companies are implementing various strategies, such as diversifying sourcing, negotiating costs with vendors, and importing goods ahead of tariff implementations, to mitigate the financial burden. While lower-income households show greater sensitivity to price adjustments, the overall effect of tariffs has been less severe than initially anticipated, though costs are projected to continue rising through the latter half of the fiscal year.

Notable successes include "Cyberpunk 2077" and "The Witcher" series. Developers attribute their distinctive creativity to a "special survival gene" and a focus on diverse genres, ranging from simulations to horror.
