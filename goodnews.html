          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh achieved a significant milestone by hitting his 54th home run of the season, tying Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for a switch-hitter. This historic blast contributed to the Mariners' dominant 11-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels, propelling them into sole possession of first place in the American League West and extending their winning streak to nine games. Raleigh, while acknowledging the personal achievement, highlighted his primary focus on the team's objective to end their long-standing division title drought, which dates back to 2001. Manager Dan Wilson lauded Raleigh's exceptional all-around performance and humble approach, noting his commitment to winning as the core driver of his success.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, expressing confidence in his leadership qualities to address the city's challenges. Despite acknowledging past disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's shared commitment to neighborhood safety, urban affordability, and a firm stance against Donald Trump's political agenda. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has recently made efforts to moderate his image, including apologizing for a 2020 social media post critical of the NYPD. This significant endorsement from the moderate governor aims to unify the Democratic party, as Mamdani faces incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high of 3,420.23 on Monday, extending its winning streak to ten consecutive sessions. This significant market boost followed an announcement by Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol that the government would abandon its previous plan to raise taxes on stock investments, signaling a supportive stance for investors. While South Korea's market showed strong gains, other Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors monitored ongoing U.S.-China talks in Madrid and evaluated recent Chinese economic data, which indicated a slowdown. U.S. equity futures were largely flat as market participants awaited a Federal Reserve meeting this week, with hopes for potential interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

The bill, introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature. Proponents argue that the article enhances transparency, boosts public trust, and helps prevent impersonation, citing concerns over rising fascism and ICE's masking practices. While exemptions exist for SWAT teams, approved undercover assignments, and medical masks, opponents, such as the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association, contend that it undermines officer safety and disregards essential operational realities for law enforcement personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has approved a world-first single-dose vaccine to protect koalas against chlamydia, a leading cause of death and infertility for the beloved marsupials. Developed by University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) researchers over a decade, the vaccine aims to combat the rapid, devastating spread of the disease, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations. Chlamydia can cause blindness, starvation, and bladder damage in koalas. While antibiotics previously offered limited and often problematic treatment, this new vaccine provides three levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms. The approval for widespread production and use by the APVMA offers significant hope for the species' conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of the regular season with significant stakes, particularly concerning their playoff seeding. Currently, they hold the third-best record among division champions, meaning they would have to play in the first round instead of receiving a bye into the division series. President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman emphasizes the strategic advantage of a bye for player recovery and optimal rotation alignment, despite the team's recent struggles. The upcoming series against the Philadelphia Phillies is crucial for improving their standing, while also keeping a close eye on the San Diego Padres, who are only 2.5 games behind in the NL West. The article details the complex scenarios and the importance of home-field advantage in the wild-card round.</p>

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience, particularly during busy or stressful periods. While not a medical condition itself, it signifies a tired, stressed, or overstretched brain, often exacerbated after weekends. Medical expert Dr. Tharaka offers four practical tips to combat this mental cloudiness, emphasizing that it's not a personal failing. These strategies focus on creating "firebreaks" or deliberately scheduled short breaks between activities, even just 5-10 minutes, to allow the brain to reset, process information, and let go of lingering stress. The article stresses that brain fog is usually temporary and it's acceptable to slow down, delegate tasks, or seek help if concerned.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts praised the team's improved quality of at-bats, situational hitting, and ability to consistently manufacture runs, with Teoscar Hernández and Mookie Betts leading the charge. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow also delivered a strong performance, settling down after early command issues to pitch into the seventh inning.

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Credited with bringing greater financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar, a moderate, won re-election easily, even in heavily Democratic Cook County. During his tenure, he pushed for budget cuts, made layoffs, and managed to make a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, ensuring a stable funding source for public schools. Despite his popularity, he surprised many by not seeking a third term. Edgar remained a respected party statesman and adviser, notably joining "Republicans for Harris" last year, reflecting his unease with the Republican party's shift to the right.</p>

          <p>Former footballer Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's persistent problems stem from personnel choices and players being used in the wrong positions, rather than manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Murphy notes improvements in the team's compactness and defensive shape, but these are overshadowed by "silly mistakes" leading to conceded goals. He specifically criticizes Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper midfield role, where his defensive instincts are lacking, costing the team goals. Murphy suggests that while the system has potential, the manager's failure to recognize and address player discomfort or unsuitability in specific roles is causing recurring errors and undermining the team's overall performance.</p>

Zheng emphasizes that the meaning and direction of society and technology are fundamentally determined by humanities and social sciences.
