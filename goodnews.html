          <h2>Trump Announces Plan to Double Tariffs on Foreign Steel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh that he intends to double tariffs on foreign steel to 50%. The president believes this increase will further secure the steel industry, preventing foreign steel from being able to "get over the fence." Trump was speaking at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works after indicating support for a merger with Japan's Nippon, a deal that includes commitments to keep U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a decade and provide workers with a $5,000 bonus. While Trump describes the deal as a partnership controlled by the USA, details on the structure remain scarce.</p>

          <p>The Navy has halted its funding for dog and cat experiments after receiving a letter from PETA to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the termination of all Department of the Navy testing on cats and dogs. PETA is urging the Department of Defense to conduct an agency-wide audit to eliminate waste and abuse in animal experimentation, specifically requesting a ban on animals in Navy decompression sickness and Army weapon-wounding tests. The organization claims the Navy has spent over $5.1 million since 2020 on decompression sickness tests on animals at multiple universities, involving procedures that caused suffering and death to pigs and rats.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn F√©in leader, has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages over a BBC story that defamed him by alleging he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and the legal bill for the case is believed to be between ‚Ç¨3-5 million. Adams stated that taking the case was about "putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation," while the BBC expressed disappointment and defended its journalism.

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, employing technologies like drones for nightly patrols in Nanjing to address challenges brought by urbanization. The AI focuses on patrolling blind spots ignored by human patrols, enhancing urban management. However, analysts warn that China's AI governance faces challenges such as privacy protection and limited community involvement, mirroring issues in other countries adopting the technology. These challenges highlight the need for careful consideration and ethical frameworks as AI becomes more integrated into urban environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier. This is down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September, with core prices also showing a decrease. Despite rising incomes, consumer spending slowed, potentially reflecting caution in response to higher goods prices, although economists have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its key interest rate while evaluating the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
