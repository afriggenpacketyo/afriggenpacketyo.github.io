          <p>The UK's retail sales volumes saw a surprising 0.6% increase in July, exceeding analyst expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This growth was largely driven by strong sales in clothing, footwear, and online retail, with businesses attributing the boost to favorable weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Despite the monthly rise, the ONS noted that sales over the three-month period to July were down, and it acknowledged recent errors in its data collection and reporting.</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of China to refinance its dollar-denominated loans into Chinese yuan, a move aimed at easing pressure on its foreign currency reserves. The plan would primarily affect the debt incurred for the Standard Gauge Railway project. By switching currencies, Kenya anticipates the interest rate on these loans could be nearly halved, dropping from over 6% in US dollars to approximately 3% in yuan, representing a significant potential cost saving for the nation.</p>
