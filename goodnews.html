          <p>In California, gardeners are increasingly planting native species in parks as a proactive measure to prevent the spread of wildfires, especially in the Los Angeles area. These efforts are also providing a sense of purpose for individuals seeking new directions, particularly those leaving struggling industries like film and TV. The focus on care and stewardship through gardening allows people to channel their energy into tangible environmental benefits, contributing to community resilience against natural disasters. The Elysian Test Plot showcases the beauty and functionality of these native plants, such as lacy phacelia and elegant clarkias, in mitigating wildfire risks.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to allocate 900 billion yen to combat the negative impacts of U.S. tariffs, marking its first fiscal response to President Trump's trade policies, and the overall relief package could reach 2.8 trillion yen with local government spending. In response to soaring rice prices, the government has started selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming to reduce prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. Other measures include Japan Post introducing online 7-digit codes as digital addresses and the Osaka expo reversing its no-smoking policy to set up two smoking areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic debris. The activity, which began on Sunday afternoon, featured lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet from the north vent and 800 feet from the south vent. While lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, an eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair was released, posing potential hazards to nearby residents and visitors. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is monitoring the activity and providing updates, with tourists flocking to witness the spectacle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated a revised rice sales system, directly contracting with major retailers to sell government rice stockpiles at reduced prices in an effort to lower consumer costs. The move, led by the newly appointed farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi, aims to bring rice prices down to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action bypasses the auction system, which was seen as contributing to rising prices, and includes the establishment of a special response team to address high rice price issues and prevent consumer disaffection. The public appears receptive to the new measures, with a recent poll indicating optimism that Koizumi can effectively lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation is diverse and develops during puberty through a combination of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause determining a person's attraction. Research suggests that genetics, hormones, and social influences play a role, but sexual orientation is not hereditary and remains stable after adolescence. Despite growing acceptance, homosexuality is still criminalized in many countries, highlighting the importance of unbiased discussions about sexual diversity. No sexual orientation is a disease, and rejection from family can negatively impact a child's self-esteem and mental health.</p>
