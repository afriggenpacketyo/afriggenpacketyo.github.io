        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security checks at U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate policy change, citing significant advancements in security technology over the years. The rule, which was implemented nationwide in 2006, originated after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. While this change streamlines the process for regular travelers, rules for removing belts, coats, laptops, and liquids from bags remain in effect for now.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos recently sold nearly three million shares of Amazon stock, totaling approximately $665.8 million. The transaction, disclosed in a regulatory filing, is part of a pre-arranged plan to sell up to 25 million shares of the company through May 2026. This sale follows another significant divestment of over $730 million in shares at the end of June. Despite these sales, Bezos remains Amazon's largest shareholder, holding over 900 million shares valued at nearly $200 billion, and continues to serve as the company's chairman.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has officially ended its emergency response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which was initiated in April 2024. The deactivation comes as a result of declining infections in animals and a lack of human-to-human transmission, with no new human cases reported since February. The agency stated that the current public health risk is low and will now integrate bird flu updates into its routine influenza reporting. However, some medical experts remain concerned about the potential for a resurgence of the virus in the fall.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured their place in the Club World Cup final with a victory over Brazilian side Fluminense, driven by two spectacular goals from their new forward, João Pedro. The former Fluminense player scored in each half, first with a powerful long-range shot and second with a rising drive off the crossbar, to seal the win in New Jersey. Despite the challenging heat, Chelsea's attack proved too much for the opposition. The team will now face either Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid in the final, with a significant amount of prize money at stake.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting nearly 700 meters deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser in November 1942 during the Battle of Tassafaronga when it was struck by a Japanese torpedo, an incident that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the remaining crew heroically saved the ship, sailing it to Australia for temporary repairs. The discovery provides a tangible link to the sacrifices of the ship's crew during one of the U.S. Navy's most difficult nights in World War II.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, savers are being advised to act strategically with certificates of deposit (CDs) before potential interest rate changes. Key recommendations include carefully calculating deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties and shopping at online banks, which often offer higher rates. Once a high-rate CD is found, experts urge savers to lock in the rate promptly, as comments from the Fed could shift the rate climate even if no immediate cut occurs. This proactive approach aims to maximize earnings while high rates are still available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review in The Atlantic offers a positive assessment of the new "Superman" film, calling it a brilliant and consciously sincere reimagining of the character. The movie, directed by James Gunn, is praised for placing Superman in a world already populated with other superheroes, which helps to define his unique, altruistic nature. Unlike previous darker takes, this version embraces a lighthearted, whimsical tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons. The review highlights David Corenswet's performance as a more relatable, regular-guy hero and applauds the film's success in making a case for the character's inherent goodness.</p>

          <p>The UK's House of Commons has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation is designed to protect the financial sustainability of clubs and give fans a greater voice in the sport. The bill was a key manifesto promise and was reintroduced by the new Labour government after failing to pass before the last general election. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy hailed the move as a victory for fans, putting them back at the heart of the game after numerous clubs faced financial crises.</p>
