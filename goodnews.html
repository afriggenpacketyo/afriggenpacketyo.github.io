          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced a $600 billion investment deal with the country, including significant defense sales. Trump praised Saudi Arabia as an example for the Middle East and deepened U.S.-Saudi ties through multiple economic and defense agreements. The agreements include judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and FBI coordination, alongside billions in investments in U.S. data centers. Trump also stated his intention to normalize relations and lift sanctions on the new government in Syria, hoping for a chance at peace, while business leaders like Elon Musk and Larry Fink attended an investment summit, anticipated to result in substantial deals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to accept a $400 million luxury jumbo jet from Qatar has sparked ethical concerns and questions about potential quid pro quo arrangements. The gift raises concerns about violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from accepting high-value gifts without congressional approval. The Trump Organization has seen an increase in activity in the Gulf region, including plans for Trump towers and golf resorts in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. Pam Bondi, Trump's attorney general, conducted a legal analysis of the Qatar plane gift that concluded it would be legally permissible, despite her previous work as a lobbyist for the Qatari government.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group PKK announced it would end its armed insurgency against Turkey, potentially impacting Syria and Iraq. The PKK's decision follows a call for disarmament by its founder, Abdullah Ocalan. The move could reassure Turkey, which views the SDF in Syria as a PKK proxy. The deal between the SDF and Damascus could be facilitated by a successful peace process between Turkey and the PKK, potentially halting Turkish attacks in Syria.</p>

          <p>Amid ever-changing U.S. tariff policies, a shopping expert offers tips to save money, including looking for sales, checking product origins, and purchasing domestic products. A recent agreement with China would reduce the level of U.S. taxes on Chinese goods, while a trade agreement with the United Kingdom will cut tariffs on U.K. cars and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. Consumers should consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming, and avoid panic shopping.</p>

          <p>Jennie Erin Smith's book, Valley of Forgetting, explores memory, medicine, and hereditary fate in rural Colombia, focusing on families affected by a rare genetic mutation linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The book chronicles the lives of families and scientists drawn together by this mutation, suggesting that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss. It is also a chance to explore other forms of humanity grounded in feeling, presence, or touch, ultimately offering a new metaphor for dementia that embraces connection, roots, and renewal.</p>
