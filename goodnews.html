          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards is marking the 30th anniversary of his triple jump world record of 18.29 meters, set at the 1995 World Championships. While proud, Edwards expressed that the record's longevity might not be a positive sign for the health of athletics, suggesting the sport may not be attracting top talent due to lower financial rewards compared to other sports. He set the record with a groundbreaking double arm action technique, becoming the first person to legally jump beyond 18 meters. Despite advancements in sports science and footwear, no one has come closer than American Christian Taylor's 18.21m jump a decade ago.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine could happen soon, following what the White House described as "great progress" in talks. The diplomatic movement comes from discussions led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow. While officials are cautious not to overstate the breakthrough, the developments suggest a possible shift in the nearly 200-day-long conflict. Key questions remain about Russia's willingness to agree to a ceasefire and whether President Putin would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but the talks signal a new phase of diplomatic engagement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) is introducing enhanced checks on tyre exports after a BBC investigation revealed that millions of used tyres were being sent to illegal furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The EA acknowledged it is "highly likely" that UK tyres are being diverted to makeshift pyrolysis plants, which cause severe environmental damage and health risks. While campaigners and industry bodies welcomed the new checks, they expressed disappointment that the EA did not implement a full ban on whole-tyre exports, an approach they believe is necessary to close loopholes exploited by criminals and ensure environmentally sound disposal.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball game, officiating the series between the Miami Marlins and the Atlanta Braves. After working in the minor leagues since 2016 and umpiring spring training games for the past two years, the 48-year-old is breaking a significant barrier in the sport. Her debut follows in the footsteps of other female officiating pioneers, such as Shannon Eastin and Sarah Thomas in the NFL, and Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner in the NBA. These women overcame long-standing barriers to officiate at the highest levels of prominent men's professional sports leagues.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprising strength, with exports growing 7.2% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, significantly beating economists' forecasts. Imports also saw their largest jump in a year, rising 4.1%, which suggests a potential recovery in domestic demand. The robust export performance has provided strong support for the Chinese economy so far this year, though some analysts caution this may be partly due to businesses front-loading shipments ahead of a potential U.S. tariff deadline. The positive data comes as negotiators for the U.S. and China continue to seek an agreement to prevent further tariff escalations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major discovery, researchers have found that the metal lithium, known for treating mood disorders, is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function, particularly in the brain. A study in the journal Nature revealed that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain aging and the buildup of plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, maintaining normal lithium levels protected against these changes. The research suggests that beta-amyloid plaques may deplete available lithium in the brain, creating a vicious cycle. This finding could pave the way for new diagnostic tests and low-dose lithium treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, just months after returning from a challenging test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The mission, intended to be brief, was extended to over nine months after the Starliner experienced significant technical issues, including thruster outages and gas leaks. NASA ultimately deemed it too risky for Wilmore and his crewmate Suni Williams to return on the Starliner, instead bringing them home on a SpaceX mission. Throughout the ordeal, Wilmore maintained he was prepared for the extended stay and committed to the mission, leaving behind what NASA officials called a "lasting legacy of fortitude."</p>
