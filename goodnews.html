          <h2>OPEC+ Alliance Announces Larger-Than-Expected Oil Production Increase for August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day. The decision is part of a gradual rollback of voluntary production cuts implemented earlier. The OPEC Secretariat cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the primary reasons for accelerating the production increase. This move aims to balance the market amid rising summer demand and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors are examining the popular belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can relieve migraine headaches. The primary active ingredient is caffeine, which can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels in the brain, potentially offering temporary relief for some individuals. However, medical experts caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger for others and that relying on sugary drinks is not a recommended long-term solution. They suggest healthier alternatives for caffeine and electrolytes, such as organic coffee or watermelon with salt, and note that the combination of salt, sugar, and caffeine in fast food may explain some anecdotal remedies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived Poor People's Campaign, a national 'moral movement' using nonviolent protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice. The movement directly confronts the Trump administration's agenda, which includes significant cuts to social services like Medicaid and food assistance, which Barber terms 'policy murder.' Rooted in a tradition of religious protest, the campaign frames justice as a sacred obligation, arguing that the current political climate represents an unholy alliance between nationalism, capitalism, and religion that harms the most vulnerable. Barber's fusion movement aims to unite poor and working-class people across all demographics to create a moral force for political change.</p>

          <p>FICO, the most widely used credit scoring company in the U.S., has announced it will begin incorporating 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loan data into its credit score calculations starting in fall 2025. This change could allow consumers who use services like Affirm and Afterpay to build their credit history through responsible, on-time payments. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively impact scores. The move reflects the growing prevalence of these short-term loans, especially among younger consumers and those with sub-prime credit, who are also more likely to miss payments.

          <p>Following an immigration raid that left his mother fearful of continuing her work, 14-year-old Christopher Luna Garcia took over her tamale street vending business in Pasadena. His story gained traction after a community activist shared a video on social media, prompting a massive outpouring of support. A subsequent event organized to help the family saw hundreds of customers line up, buying out all 500 tamales and raising over $1,500. The incident highlights a trend of American-born children stepping in for immigrant parents amid a federal crackdown, while also showcasing a community's powerful response to support its vulnerable members.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally responded to the latest US-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, describing its response as 'positive' and stating it is ready for immediate negotiations. However, the group has not fully accepted the terms, instead requesting several significant amendments. According to a Palestinian official, these changes include a demand for a US guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail and an end to a controversial US-backed aid distribution system. The development has been met with cautious optimism, with President Trump noting it 'could be a Gaza deal next week,' though significant hurdles clearly remain.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into the architecture of traditional finance. Major financial players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are now building on or integrating with Ethereum and its ecosystem to tokenize assets, manage funds, and offer new services. Robinhood, for instance, launched on-chain tokenized U.S. stocks for European users. Despite price volatility, institutions are reportedly choosing Ethereum not for hype, but for its stability, security, and decade-long track record, solidifying its position as a foundational layer for the future of Wall Street.

          <p>Following last month's military strikes on Iran by Israel and the U.S., Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a 'new international agreement' to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over regional tensions and emphasized the need to place Iran's nuclear activities under strict IAEA supervision. The call for a new pact positions China as a potential mediator in the escalating crisis. It reflects Beijing's strategy of criticizing the U.S. and Israeli actions while simultaneously styling itself as a responsible global power seeking a diplomatic resolution to prevent further conflict.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at Nathan's Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, cementing his legacy as a dominant figure in the sport of competitive eating. This victory was particularly significant as Chestnut had been banned from the previous year's event due to a sponsorship dispute with a rival brand. The article delves into the bizarre yet serious world of elite eating, highlighting Chestnut's intense training regimen, which includes neck exercises and breathing techniques. It frames the spectacle as a uniquely American event that reflects the nation's complex and often excessive relationship with food, consumption, and freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies on visual illusions are reigniting the long-standing debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently. One study found that people from 'carpentered' Western environments tend to see rectangles in an illusion where rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly argues that the famous Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent, as it even works on non-human animals. This article explores the complexities of perceptual diversity, suggesting that our experience of the world is always an active construction by the brain, and that differences in perception likely exist within cultures as much as between them.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming. The historic move follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort, a legacy project of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which aimed to make the river safe for athletes and residents. Swimming had been banned since 1923 due to severe pollution and safety hazards. Three supervised swimming zones have been established with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, allowing Parisians and tourists to cool off in the iconic river amid a summer heatwave. Officials will continuously monitor water quality to ensure safety.</p>
