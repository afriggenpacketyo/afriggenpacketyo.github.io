          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one aimed at high-value political donors and the other at memecoin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, will feature David Sacks, who is influencing crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will grant access based on $TRUMP token holdings, with top holders promised dinner with Trump. Accountable.US has criticized the leaderboard contest as a corrupt scheme that could allow wealthy donors, possibly including foreign actors, to buy access to the president, while enriching the Trump family. Optimism score is 70.</p>

This equates to a compounded annual return of 19.9% for Berkshire, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is meeting this week to discuss monetary policy and interest rates, which could influence mortgage rates. While a rate cut is unlikely for May, any hints from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell about future cuts in June could cause lenders to preemptively lower rates. Inflation is cooling and unemployment is steady, possibly motivating the Fed to cut rates before summer. Buyers should monitor rates daily and ensure their credit profiles are strong to secure the best possible mortgage rate.</p>
