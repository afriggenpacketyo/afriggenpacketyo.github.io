          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has officially filed for an IPO on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," emphasizing its status as a tech company rather than a traditional bank.

Chime reported $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with a 32% revenue increase and 8.6 million active members. The IPO plans were delayed due to market volatility stemming from tariff announcements made in April.</p>
