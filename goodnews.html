        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 4-4 deadlock ruling in the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond case, preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, leading to the even split and upholding the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision that such schools would violate the state and U.S. constitutions. This outcome means the existing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular continues, though proponents of religious charter schools may attempt to create one again in the future. The court's action leaves in place lower court rulings that said the arrangement would have violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced plans to build a massive computing complex in the United Arab Emirates, in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, SoftBank, and Emirati AI firm G42. This joint venture includes constructing data centers in the UAE, with G42 also contributing to OpenAI data centers in the United States. The Emirati facility is part of Sam Altman's ambitious plan to build powerful AI systems globally. The arrangement overlaps with a separate agreement to build an AI campus in Abu Dhabi powered by five gigawatts of electrical power, but the deal has divided Washington, with some fearing it could turn the Middle East into an AI rival of the United States.</p>

          <p>New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, a mayoral candidate, plans to deliver a campaign speech at Elmhurst Hospital, connecting her father's death from Covid-19 to mismanagement by former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Adams will argue that her father was failed by the state government due to slow distribution of PPE and other resources to Black and brown communities. Cuomo's campaign has rejected these claims, and allies describe her as a common-sense candidate who can compete with Cuomo for Black voters. Adams has qualified for public matching funds and is seeking to siphon Black primary voters away from Cuomo.</p>

This award is higher than the previously budgeted 2.8%, with the remainder to be funded from existing budgets. Education unions have welcomed the decision but warn of potential cuts to school budgets. Health unions, however, reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise offered to other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action, and the Royal College of Nursing called the disparity in pay rises "grotesque."</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, with a phase-out over $500,000. The provision, if enacted, would go into effect in 2025, with annual increases of 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the SALT deduction was unlimited.</p>

These accounts function similarly to 529 college savings plans, providing tax-deferred earnings growth and long-term capital gains tax rates on qualified withdrawals. While similar to custodial brokerage accounts (UTMA/UGMA), Trump Accounts avoid the "kiddie tax" on investment income. These accounts offer another option for families to save for their children's future, though 529 plans may still be superior for higher education savings due to federal tax-free growth and the ability to roll over unused funds into a Roth IRA.</p>

          <h2>Nike to Increase Prices in US Amid Tariff Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US starting in June, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to tariffs. The company did not explicitly cite US tariffs as the reason, stating that it regularly makes "price adjustments". Almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia, a region affected by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing more than $100, with prices rising by as much as $10. The company's finance chief has stated that the company was "navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment" including tariffs.</p>
