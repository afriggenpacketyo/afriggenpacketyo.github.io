          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 17:30:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has unveiled plans for stricter visa rules aimed at fixing what he describes as a 'broken' migration system. The proposed reforms include tougher English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents, as well as extending the waiting period for migrants to apply for settled status from five to ten years. These changes are intended to create a controlled, selective, and fair immigration system, ensuring that those entering the UK commit to integration and language acquisition. Critics worry about potential family separations, while supporters emphasize the importance of language skills for employment and integration.</p>

          <p>Following reports of 'substantial progress' in US-China trade talks, economists and investors offered cautious optimism. Some analysts believe a de-escalation was inevitable, with a potential lowering of tariffs and purchase agreements for agricultural products. However, concerns remain that tariffs will still be dramatically higher and weigh on US growth. Others see the news as slightly better than expected, potentially taking a trade war with China off the table.</p>
