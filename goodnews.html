          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by positive sentiment following an announcement of a trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its resilience and status as a safe-haven asset amid market uncertainty. Analysts suggest that a pro-crypto administration and strong buying activity from spot-ETF investors are contributing factors. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions and concerns about Federal Reserve policies could test Bitcoin's resilience in the future.</p>
