          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions across several states. He emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising more jobs and a $5,000 bonus for each U.S. steelworker, while also guaranteeing no layoffs or outsourcing for at least 10 years. Trump portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker, claiming he rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America, stating that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," though specifics on ownership structure were not provided. During the 2024 campaign, Trump had pledged to block the acquisition of U.S. Steel by a foreign company. Optimism hinges on the actual implementation and the details of the deal's structure, as well as the future economic impacts. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, aiming to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, he stated this move would ensure U.S. Steel's survival, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for U.S. steelworkers. Trump reflected on implementing 25% steel tariffs during his first term, touting the increase as a way to ensure U.S. Steel's survival, as the announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs. While campaigning for president, Trump had said he would block foreign acquisition of US Steel, and it's unclear how the reported partnership would operate and who would own the company.

          <p>President Trump downplayed rumors of a rift with Elon Musk during Musk's official last day as a "special government employee," praising him as a great business leader. Trump indicated that Musk would continue to be involved, stating that many of his DOGE team members would remain in the administration, and Musk declared he would continue to visit the White House as an advisor. Musk attended the press conference with a visible black eye, attributing it to a playful punch from his son, X √Ü A-12, while Trump offered marital advice to French President Macron regarding a video of Macron and his wife. The article suggests a positive, if somewhat unconventional, departure for Musk from his government role.</p>

Trump praised Rudolph as a potential franchise quarterback, complimenting Killebrew as a "killer." Trump has become popular among professional athletes throughout his second term and dating back to his campaign, especially among football players, and Trump's signature dance became a frequent touchdown celebration during the 2024 NFL season.

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer a set of historic photos depicting enslaved people to the International African American Museum in South Carolina. The agreement ends a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people in the photos, which were taken in 1850. The photos were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz as part of discredited research to prove white superiority, and the case sparked debate about universities' historical links to slavery. Harvard said it had always hoped the photos would be given to another museum, and Ms. Lanier expressed her joy with the outcome. The transfer of the images marks a significant step in addressing the legacy of slavery and promoting access to these important historical artifacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse, and the judges argue she is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach by the executive branch" that threatens public trust in the judicial system. Dugan pleaded not guilty, and the case raises concerns about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. The outcome of the case will likely have implications for judicial independence and the balance of power between branches of government.</p>

Trump asserted that the agreement ensured US Steel would remain under American control, framing the drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security. He blamed "decades of Washington betrayals" for hollowing out the American steel industry, and repeated false claims about the 2020 election.

Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at 87, believed to be of natural causes, and was known for her long-running role as the head nurse on the show. Swit won two Emmys for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and wanted to portray Houlihan as more than the "Hot Lips" nickname her character was given. She said she still received letters from women all over the world who decided to become nurses because of Houlihan, saying contributing to someone's life like that is remarkable. Swit's portrayal of Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan was groundbreaking, bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy's most enduring roles.</p>
