          <p>Portugal defeated Germany 2-1 in the Nations League semifinal, despite Joshua Kimmich making his 100th appearance and assisting Germany's first goal. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning goal for Portugal, marking his 137th international goal and securing his team's place in the final. Kimmich acknowledged that Germany was not at 100 percent and lacked the necessary energy to win, despite his milestone achievement. The match was delayed due to a storm, and while Kimmich felt the team was more consolidated than in the past, they ultimately failed to capitalize on their opportunities, giving Ronaldo another night of praise.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Reveals How Feather Fossils Helped Birds Conquer the Sky</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feather fossils found in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in dominating the skies. The research, published in Science Bulletin, examined 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period. The study found that the development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds. While many feathered dinosaurs existed, most lacked the ability to fly, though some could glide or achieve powered flight.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria infants encounter after birth can protect them from dangerous infections, potentially halving the risk of hospitalization for lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life and tracked their hospital data for two years. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum, a common early inhabitant of the human body, showed a protective effect, with only 4% of babies with this species needing hospitalization for lung infections. The study suggests that early microbial encounters play a crucial role in immune system development.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warns that the impact of these medicines on unborn babies is unknown. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice, particularly when purchased from unregulated sources. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant.</p>
