          <p>David Kaczynski, who turned his brother Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) in to the FBI, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of his brother's bombs. The article explores David's initial guilt and his wife's suggestion to connect with the victims as a path toward healing. While most victims did not engage, Wright responded, and the two found common ground in their respective journeys of recovery and forgiveness. Their unlikely bond, developed over years of joint public appearances, serves as a powerful example of reconciliation emerging from profound violence and tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets, rather than a lack of skill or ambition, often prevent people from increasing their income. The first limiting belief is feeling ashamed for not already knowing how to make more money, which prevents individuals from seeking necessary help or education. The second is the false expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the need for patience and systematic effort. Finally, the habit of procrastination, or telling oneself they will start 'later,' allows years to pass without taking meaningful action. Sethi emphasizes that overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward achieving financial goals.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's ambitious goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029, emulating the post-war government's new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including industry cost pressures and criticism from some local communities who feel uninformed about the project's scale.</p>

          <p>China's advanced Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, is reportedly preparing for its first sea trials, sparking speculation about its capabilities as the world's first dedicated drone carrier. Recent social media images show that covers have been removed from the ship's electromagnetic catapult system, a key feature for launching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This vessel is considered a significant asset for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, enhancing its operational capacity for drone warfare. The development of such ships is particularly relevant in the context of regional tensions, as they could play a crucial role in any potential conflict involving Taiwan.</p>

This grassroots effort, supported by organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to address the disproportionate impact of poor air quality on communities of color, which are often located near industrial hubs and highways. The data collected helps fill gaps left by official government monitors and empowers residents to advocate for stronger regulations and enforcement. The initiative comes as the Trump administration moves to roll back numerous environmental protections, making community-led monitoring more critical than ever.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite occasional large fires, the United States has seen a dramatic and underappreciated decline in fire-related fatalities over the past four decades. The per-capita civilian fire death rate has fallen by approximately two-thirds since 1980, with total reported fires dropping by half. This progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers. Other contributing factors are safer furniture standards, a significant decrease in cigarette smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes in modern buildings, all of which have made homes and cities safer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively pursuing deals with U.S. mining companies to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China. Following a Pentagon decision to take an equity stake and provide a price floor for rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders are anticipating similar government support for other companies. Miners of rare earths, lithium, and other strategic minerals are seen as potential targets for federal investment to stabilize volatile prices and encourage domestic production. This shift toward strategic capitalism signals the administration's willingness to intervene in the market to counter China's dominance in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is expecting its eight-day "golden week" holiday, which begins this week, to generate approximately 2.4 billion journeys, providing a significant stimulus to its consumer economy. This major travel period, combining National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a critical time for domestic tourism and spending. According to the transport ministry, the vast majority of these trips, around 1.87 billion, will be made by car, reflecting a preference for personal vehicle travel. The first day of the holiday is projected to be the busiest, with an estimated 340 million journeys expected, surpassing travel numbers from this year's Lunar New Year.</p>

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, believed to have been dislodged from a riverbed by Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been discovered and preserved by Florida state archeologists. The 9-foot log boat is unique among the 450 ancient canoes found in the state because it is the first made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing its creation in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating has so far been inconclusive, investigators are exploring the theory that it could be a dugout cayuco made by Spanish settlers in the 16th century.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media broadcast has claimed that the country's J-35 stealth fighter jet possesses a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, suggesting superior stealth capabilities compared to the U.S. F-35. The report on CCTV attributed the J-35's low observability to its unique airframe design and proprietary metamaterial technology. For comparison, the radar cross-section of the American F-35 is often cited as being around the size of a golf ball. This announcement highlights the ongoing technological competition between the two nations as China continues to advance its military hardware to rival that of the United States.</p>
