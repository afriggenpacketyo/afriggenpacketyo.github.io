          <p>A 20-year-old woman received treatment for non-life-threatening injuries after likely being bitten by a shark at Jones Beach, Long Island. Experts believe a juvenile sand tiger shark was responsible for the minor lacerations on her leg and foot. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended while authorities conducted drone searches for marine life. Officials emphasized that such encounters are rare, with only 47 confirmed unprovoked bites worldwide last year.</p>

          <p>Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd has revealed his intention to develop top draft pick Cooper Flagg by playing him in multiple positions, including point guard. The goal is to make the 18-year-old uncomfortable to accelerate his growth and test his versatility during the upcoming NBA Summer League. Kidd, supported by part-owner Mark Cuban, drew parallels to his experience developing Giannis Antetokounmpo, emphasizing that allowing young players to fail is part of the process. Flagg is expected to make his debut against the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol was dispatched this week following a driver's report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. Upon investigation, the officer discovered the animal was not a tiger cub but a dead hawk. It remains unclear why the caller mistook the bird for a large feline. Authorities noted that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without specific permits for institutions like zoos or research facilities.</p>
