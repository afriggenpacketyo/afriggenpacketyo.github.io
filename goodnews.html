          <p>Treasury yields decreased following President Trump's proposal of a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. Investors sought safety in bonds amid concerns that these trade actions would negatively impact the economy. The 30-year Treasury yield fell by 4 basis points to 5.027%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 6 basis points to 4.497%. These moves came after a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by fears that Trump's budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which was further compounded by Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE effort with Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. The Trump administration appealed the decision, but the judge emphasized that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates. The judge stated that a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.</p>

          <p>A large study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound. The study, published in The Lancet, showed that contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors than standard mammograms, the study found, but are considerably more expensive. The scans were given to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that hadn‚Äôt turned up any abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective than M.R.I. scans, and they could be made more widely available at existing mammography centers with staff training and sometimes technology upgrades.</p>

The PKK's decision to disarm came two months after its imprisoned founder, Abdullah √ñcalan, suggested that the war had become obsolete. The Turkish government now has an opportunity to consolidate the peace by offering amnesty to the PKK's fighters and addressing the grievances that sparked the war in the first place: more cultural rights and respect for the Kurds. The PKK's leaders see their latest move less as a surrender than as the advent of a new phase in their movement.

The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms. Prior to the Pentagon memo standardizing search terms, the Navy used its own terms that identified 381 titles, including titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou. A defense official said that the new review using the DOD search terms found only two or three book titles included in the Navy's earlier search.</p>
