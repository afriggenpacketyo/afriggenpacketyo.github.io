          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice reserves to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which have reached near-record highs due to supply shortages. This measure involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned off. However, this substantial release could reduce the stockpile to a level that raises concerns about the government's ability to respond to future harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions. </p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned that growth forecasts for the year have been downgraded by both the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three Maori members of parliament in New Zealand are facing suspension after performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The traditional dance was initiated by opposition MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke in response to a controversial bill seeking to redefine the country's founding treaty. A parliamentary committee deemed the haka potentially intimidating to other lawmakers, recommending suspensions for Maipi-Clarke and Te PƒÅti MƒÅori co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. The MƒÅori Party has criticized the recommendations as a colonial overreach. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that spending time in nature can aid in recovery from physical injuries, as illustrated by Sarah Allely's experience of reduced pain after a brain injury when she started taking walks in the bush. Studies indicate that nature can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and even brief exposure to natural environments can lower pain levels. Experts explain that nature provides a softer form of attention that requires fewer mental resources, allowing the brain to rest and promote emotional well-being, which in turn positively impacts physical recovery. This highlights the potential benefits of incorporating nature into rehabilitation and daily life. </p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely attributed to pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not anticipated to be a major factor, according to the IMF. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system where most of the value comes from intellectual property, with manufacturing contracted to other countries. The U.S. is a key trading partner, but only 3% of total exports are produced in Denmark and pass through customs, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. </p>

The "Great Charter," the first extant expression in writing of the principle that a king and his government are not above the law, originally dates from June 1215, when it was signed by King John.
