          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" ready to purchase TikTok, with their identities to be revealed within two weeks. This development occurs as the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest from the platform's U.S. operations approaches on September 17. The potential sale is a consequence of a 2024 law aimed at addressing national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership. Any deal would likely require approval from both the U.S. and Chinese governments, adding complexity to the platform's uncertain future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has officially lifted its ban on seafood imports from most of Japan, ending a nearly two-year prohibition that was a major blow to Japan's fishing industry. The ban was imposed in August 2023 in response to Japan's discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The restriction will remain in place for 10 prefectures, including Fukushima, but the reopening of the market to other regions marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations, though imports will require new registration and certifications.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large tech companies just one day before the first payments were due. The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade negotiations with Canada over the tax, which he argued unfairly targeted American firms. Ottawa's reversal is intended to facilitate the resumption of talks for a comprehensive trade arrangement, resolving a significant point of economic friction between the two nations.

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States took effect Monday, reducing a 25% tariff on British cars to 10% and unleashing pent-up demand for UK auto exports. Luxury brands like Aston Martin and JLR expect a significant surge in shipments to the U.S. market. However, the deal has drawn sharp criticism from the National Farmers' Union, which argues that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip, citing concessions like the removal of tariffs on American ethanol that could harm UK biofuel producers.

Japan plans to strongly urge Beijing to remove the remaining import restrictions that still apply to products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima. This diplomatic effort aims to fully restore market access for all Japanese seafood, which was halted nearly two years ago due to concerns over the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.
