          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire, was damaged when the top portion came into contact with power lines during a helicopter lift. No injuries were reported. The tower was one of two being removed for testing to determine the cause of the fire. Edison International's CEO, Pedro Pizarro, suggests induction as a leading theory for the fire's cause. The towers were scheduled for testing at a warehouse as part of an agreement between SCE, county investigators, and law firms.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a revised narrative of World War II, shifting the start date to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role as a frontline force against fascism. The discussion takes place as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end.

          <p>India is considering a trade deal with the U.S. that would involve zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, up to a certain quantity. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner. Experts suggest that a trade deal would benefit logistics companies. The U.K. signed a bilateral trade agreement with India on Tuesday, under which India will gradually lower taxes on imports from the U.K., with the vast majority of goods traded becoming "fully tariff-free within a decade," according to the U.K. government.</p>
