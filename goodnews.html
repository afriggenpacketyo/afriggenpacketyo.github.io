          <p>Resorts World Sentosa's CEO affirmed the company will be prepared for its casino license renewal in 2026, following a reduced two-year extension from Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance. Despite the rebuke, the integrated resort is proceeding with a SG$6.8 billion expansion, including new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. The company's strategy is shifting from retail to experiential offerings, with new hotels and attractions like Super Nintendo World planned to transform it into a premium lifestyle destination.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000 between May and July. The number of payrolled employees also saw a slight decrease, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors, suggesting some firms are slowing recruitment or not replacing departing staff. Despite the slowdown, other indicators like wage growth remaining at 5% and a stable unemployment rate of 4.7% point to a gradual, rather than sharp, cooling of the labor market.

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, suspending planned tariff hikes that were set to take effect. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, unfair practices, and increasing market access for U.S. exporters. Despite the truce, some business owners express concern over the prolonged uncertainty, and trade flows between the two nations have already been significantly impacted this year.

Alongside the rate cut, the RBA downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker-than-expected public demand. The central bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially and is now near the lower end of its target range. This monetary easing comes amid a reshaped global trade environment and softer domestic economic performance than previously anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he agreed to join Manchester United in 2012 and was eager to play for manager Alex Ferguson. However, his club at the time, Borussia Dortmund, refused to sell him, believing they could earn more money by keeping him for another one or two years. While Lewandowski expressed that not playing in the Premier League might be a regret, he is very happy with his accomplished career at Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and Barcelona. He also spoke about the significant influence former Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp had on his life and career.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva held a phone call to discuss strengthening their bilateral relationship, which Xi described as being at its "best ever." The call, requested by Lula, came as Brazil faces potential impacts from new U.S. trade measures. Xi emphasized that the two nations should work together to set an example of solidarity for the Global South. This diplomatic engagement highlights the shifting global trade dynamics, occurring just as Washington extended a trade truce with Beijing but showed a different approach towards Brasilia.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian firm, Wild Hornets, has released video of its new "Sting" interceptor drone, which it claims can reach speeds of up to 195 miles per hour. This speed is crucial for its mission of chasing down and destroying Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. The low-cost, $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to use innovative technology to bolster its air defenses against overwhelming Russian drone and missile attacks. While still deployed at a small scale, Ukraine hopes such interceptors can help close a critical gap in its defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub faces increasing competition in the AI-powered coding tool market from fast-growing startups like Cursor and Replit. Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition, but no immediate successor has been named. GitHub, now part of Microsoft's CoreAI group, has seen significant growth with its Copilot tool, but the competitive landscape for developer productivity tools is rapidly evolving.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economist Advises Against Excessive Cash Burn in 'Quick Commerce' Sector</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to curb excessive "cash burn" competition within China's booming "quick commerce" sector. As e-commerce platforms vie for dominance in the instant retail market, which involves 30-minute delivery of goods, Wang argues for a balanced approach that fosters innovation without encouraging a zero-sum mindset. He suggests that instead of stifling competition, the goal should be to elevate it towards quality upgrades and a healthier industrial ecosystem. This approach could help the sector create new consumption opportunities vital for long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nepal Waives Climbing Fees for 97 Mountains While Increasing Everest Permits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 21:55:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a bid to boost tourism in more remote regions, Nepal has made 97 of its Himalayan peaks free to climb for the next two years. This initiative focuses on mountains in the poorer Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The move contrasts with a significant fee increase for climbing Mount Everest, where peak season permits will now cost $15,000. Authorities hope waiving fees will attract climbers to less-explored areas, generating local income and jobs, though questions remain about the infrastructure needed to support an influx of tourists in these developing regions.</p>
