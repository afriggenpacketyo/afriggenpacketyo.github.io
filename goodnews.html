        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that AI agents will soon replace some human employees in the company's corporate offices. In a memo to employees, Jassy stated that the company expects to reduce its corporate workforce in the coming years as it increasingly utilizes generative AI tools. This move towards AI is expected to improve efficiency across the company, ultimately leading to a smaller corporate workforce, although some employees have expressed concerns about the intensified work environment and routine tasks associated with AI implementation. The company currently has 1,000 generative AI services in development or already built. Optimism is tempered by concerns about job displacement and the changing nature of work. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. This decision was welcomed by abortion providers and organizations, although some groups expressed concerns about the implications for unborn children. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob Dorotik, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and some spots were not blood at all. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik persistently fought for a new examination of the evidence, maintaining her innocence. The District Attorney's Office ultimately dismissed the charges due to insufficient evidence, though the case could be reopened if new evidence surfaces. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, whose murder conviction was recently overturned, maintains that her bedroom was not a crime scene, despite investigators finding spots of blood throughout the room. Dorotik explained that her husband had a nosebleed and their dogs had bled, but authorities dismissed her explanations. According to the appeal, not every spot believed to be blood was tested, and some stains turned out not to be blood at all. Dorotik spent years seeking a new examination of the evidence, arguing that authorities focused on her from the beginning and failed to follow other leads. The case highlights the complexities of forensic evidence and the challenges of proving innocence after a wrongful conviction. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew in downtown Los Angeles that was initially imposed in response to clashes with police and vandalism during protests against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Bass, a Democrat, said the curfew provided ‚Äúsuccessful crime prevention and suppression efforts.‚Äù The curfew covered a small area of downtown and was implemented after 23 businesses were broken into and robbed. Trump had previously ordered the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to the city following the protests, reflecting ongoing tensions over immigration policies. The lifting of the curfew signals a decrease in unrest. </p>

          <p>The Senate's tax bill proposes a $1,000 baby bonus for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028, deposited into "Trump accounts." To be eligible, the child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. These accounts function similarly to 529 college savings plans, with tax-deferred growth and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. While proponents say the accounts will introduce more Americans to wealth-building, some experts find them overly complicated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of their tax cut package, similar to a House GOP provision. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, defined as cash, charged, or shared tips, available from 2025 through 2028. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the uncapped House bill. The Senate legislation also gradually reduces the deduction's value for individuals earning over $150,000, or $300,000 for married couples, while the House bill eliminates it entirely for those earning over $160,000.
