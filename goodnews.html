          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media regarding the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Jones justified the decision by stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team" both now and in the future, particularly by strengthening their run defense with the acquisition of Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark. He explained that contract negotiations with Parsons had stalled and that the trade, which also includes two future first-round draft picks, provides valuable assets. Jones emphasized the move was a consensus decision within the organization.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of ancient trees like the 800-year-old "Druids Oak" in Buckinghamshire to understand their remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify specific genes that allow these oaks to survive for centuries through climate change, disease, and other threats. Researchers hope this genetic information will help in selecting the best trees for future planting, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital ecological cornerstones, supporting thousands of species of wildlife from insects to mammals.</p>

          <p>For over four decades, host Bev Johnson has been a cornerstone of WDIA in Memphis, the first radio station in the United States programmed entirely by and for the Black community. Since its format change in 1948, WDIA has served as a vital source of music, news, and community information that was often ignored by mainstream outlets. The station played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement and helped preserve local history, such as leading the effort to save the Lorraine Motel. Johnson continues this legacy, providing a platform for community leaders and essential information to her loyal listeners.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

In an interview, Zhao emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed at which its regulators act to create a more favorable environment. He noted the Hong Kong government has shown a clear willingness to embrace Web3 technologies but suggested immediate changes are needed. Specifically, he advocated for expanding the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster growth.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain faith in strong growth stocks, using artificial intelligence leader Nvidia as a prime example. Despite a slight dip in its stock price after a strong earnings report, Cramer argued that Nvidia's dominance in the generative AI market positions it for long-term success. He believes the technology is still in its early stages and will revolutionize numerous industries, making Nvidia's products essential for future innovation. Cramer stressed that successful investing often requires trusting the market and holding quality companies through short-term fluctuations rather than trading frequently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, with some critics hailing it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging, successful movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film follows the character as he abruptly abandons a film shoot to reconnect with his family in Europe, forcing his entourage, including a manager played by Adam Sandler, to follow. Early reviews are varied, but Clooney's subtle performance is generating awards season buzz.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The judge stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which President Trump effectively dissolved by dismissing most of its members. The ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to dismantle the international broadcaster, which has seen its staff and programming drastically cut. The judge's decision reinforces the legal firewall designed to protect VOA from political interference.</p>
