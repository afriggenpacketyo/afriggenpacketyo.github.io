        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently neared $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per year, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a figure potentially influenced by reduced access in rural areas. For participating states, lottery sales are a notable source of revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of their general funds. Americans spent an average of $320 on tickets in 2023.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching two key inflation reports, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI), due this week for signals about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. Following a soft jobs report, the market is increasingly pricing in a rate reduction in September, though concerns about a broader economic slowdown persist. Also in focus is Apple's annual hardware event, where the company is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup. Analysts will be watching for potential price increases that could boost the company's sluggish revenue growth amid ongoing tariff and component cost pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of his release, he must pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chile for three years, but he plans to continue his mission.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in a race highlighted by a controversial team order from McLaren. The team instructed Oscar Piastri to yield second place to his teammate Lando Norris after a slow pit stop had reversed their on-track positions. While Norris had been running ahead for most of the race, a faulty wheel gun during his stop cost him time, but the team intervened to restore the original order. The decision has sparked debate in the ongoing title fight, though Piastri later stated he accepted the team's call as fair.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound and vibrated for approximately 10 seconds on Sunday as part of a national test of the emergency alert system. The drill, which took place around 3:00 PM, was deemed a success by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who called it an important step for public safety. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events such as severe weather or public safety emergencies.

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to create websites cataloging religious miracles, spreading his faith online. His canonization ceremony in St. Peter's Square drew tens of thousands of pilgrims, many of them young people inspired by his ability to integrate modern life with devout faith. The process for sainthood requires the Vatican to verify two miracles attributed to the candidate's intercession.</p>

Dr. Wright strictly avoids sugar and simple carbohydrates, stating she can physically feel the resulting inflammation and "dullness" in her brain.

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who has been repeatedly spotted driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on public motorways since 2019. The driver was tracked to his home after the vehicle was seen again on the D4 motorway. For years, authorities were unable to press charges because the driver's helmet obscured his identity. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, a model from a feeder series for Formula One. The man now faces fines and a possible license suspension for operating the un-roadworthy vehicle.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, who served as Germany's foreign minister until a change in government this year, has officially started her new role as President of the United Nations General Assembly. The Green Party politician's election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, a move seen as a reaction to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. In her year-long term, Baerbock will chair meetings and manage discussions among the 193 member states. Her nomination by the outgoing German government had generated some domestic controversy, with critics arguing a career diplomat was more suitable.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker has completed a 26.4-mile open-ocean journey from Catalina Island to the California mainland in a kayak he grew from mycelium, the root network of mushrooms. The 12-hour paddle is believed to be the longest open-water trip in such a vessel, aiming to showcase fungal materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation. The kayak was created by cultivating a network of wild Ganoderma polychromum mycelium on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. The project highlights the potential of innovative, environmentally friendly materials.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis" tariff exemption for small packages argues against widespread panic among small businesses. While the change will cause price increases and affect businesses that import goods, the article contends that the vast majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly impacted. The author suggests that the focus should instead be on the overall health of the U.S. economy, such as employment and consumer wealth, which determine whether customers can absorb higher prices. The piece advises businesses to adapt by diversifying suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>
