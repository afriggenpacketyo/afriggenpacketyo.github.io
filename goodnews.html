          <p>Despite significant gains in recent local elections, Reform UK is facing challenges in forming coalitions in hung councils across England. The party's policies, particularly its focus on immigration and national issues, have been met with suspicion by established parties. In some areas, Reform UK has been excluded from coalition talks, while in others, the party has shunned cooperation. The situation underscores the difficulties faced by new political forces in navigating the complexities of local government and forging alliances. The party's success in the local elections has propelled many councillors with limited or no political experience into council chambers across England.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish of cheese sauce on toast, has varied origin stories, some suggesting it began as an English joke. While some believe it was a substitute for rabbit meat for poor farmers, others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Food historians associate it with Welsh culture, cheese being vital in European diets, especially in Wales, where dairy thrived. The dish evolved from melted cheese in Wales, brought to English cities after the 1536 Act of Union, and the name 'Welsh rarebit' appeared later in English cookbooks, but there's no evidence linking it to actual rabbits.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional. The court found that teaching yoga is 'protected speech' and that the ordinance violated instructors' First Amendment rights. The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as instructors received donations, but the court sided with the instructors. The decision allows outdoor yoga classes to continue, providing access to yoga for those who may not be able to afford it otherwise. The ruling is seen as a victory for community access and freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The movie 'I Don't Understand You,' a comedy from co-writer-directors Brian Crano and David Joseph Craig, follows Dom and Cole, a gay couple eager to adopt a baby. The film sends Dom and Cole to Italy for an anniversary trip, dropping them into a series of unfortunate situations. The couple's rental car gets stuck on a private road that leads to a remote farmhouse where they have a reservation for an anniversary dinner. The evening tips over into a bloody farce of fear-driven misjudgment. The writer-directors are themselves a real-life couple who adopted a child.</p>
