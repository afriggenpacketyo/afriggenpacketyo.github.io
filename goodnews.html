        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin briefly surpassed its January record, reaching $109,857 before falling back due to rising Treasury yields and a drop in stocks. Antoni Trenchev of crypto exchange Nexo attributes Bitcoin's new high to factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $40 billion, with regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments expected to further drive prices. The Senate is also advancing legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any decrease in consumer demand due to President Trump's tariffs. Jassy's comments were made during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, where he also noted that they haven't seen any significant increases in average selling prices. Amazon is still assessing the potential impact of tariffs and trade policies, which it identified as factors that could affect its guidance for the current quarter. Walmart, however, has warned that consumers may see price increases as early as this month due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Welcome House Raleigh, a ministry of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of North Carolina, has agreed to resettle Afrikaners as refugees, despite the controversial nature of their refugee status. The ministry, which typically assists refugees from various countries, emphasizes its mandate to welcome and love all people, regardless of their background. This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church, which ended its refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government due to concerns about racial justice. The Trump administration fast-tracked Afrikaners for resettlement, citing persecution, a claim disputed by many.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses how market distractions, such as presidential announcements, debt downgrades, and tax bill battles, create buying opportunities for investors. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and trustworthy CEOs, rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Cramer notes that current market conditions, including a volatile 10-year Treasury yield and an overbought S&P Oscillator, warrant caution, but also present opportunities to acquire quality stocks at lower prices. He specifically highlights Home Depot and TJX as potential buys. (not investment advice)</p>

The Green Bay Packers' proposal fell short of the required majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The Eagles celebrated the decision on social media. The push to ban the play gained momentum after the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a surprise 'no tax on tips' bill, which, if enacted, could allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028. The proposal has received support from both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that around 4 million U.S. workers are in tipped occupations. While this policy could benefit moderate to middle-income workers, it may not provide significant advantages for lower-income individuals who already fall under the standard deduction.</p>
