          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% year-over-year and surpassing market expectations. This substantial growth is primarily fueled by the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI and 5G applications, accounted for 57% of its revenue. Consequently, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling strong confidence in the continued AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's Senate has passed a "Dignified Death" bill, making it the first country in Latin America to formally legalize euthanasia. The law permits mentally sound adult citizens in the terminal stage of an irreversible disease to opt for a medically assisted death administered by a healthcare professional. The legislation, which does not permit assisted suicide, reflects strong public support in the socially liberal nation, with over 60% of Uruguayans in favor. This move continues Uruguay's history of progressive laws, following the legalization of cannabis, same-sex marriage, and abortion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will halt its purchases of Russian oil, although a specific timeline for this cessation remains unclear. Trump stated the move would be part of a "process" and framed it as a significant step toward isolating Moscow over its war in Ukraine. India's external affairs ministry responded by stating its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy security. India is one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, and its continued trade has been a point of friction in its relationship with Washington.</p>

          <p>Ian Currie, a 76-year-old experienced hillwalker, has described his eight-day ordeal lost in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands as a "long black nightmare." Currie became lost during a 30-mile trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart amid severe weather, which left his tent, sleeping bag, and phone soaked. Exhausted and suffering from exposure, he survived with minimal food before being found by a local landowner and deer stalkers after a friend reported him missing. Members of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue team expressed amazement at his ability to survive in such inhospitable conditions for so long.</p>

A Fed governor recently highlighted that uncertainties from U.S.-China trade tensions have increased risks to the American economic outlook, strengthening the case for rate reductions.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is working to break out of a significant postseason slump, taking the rare step of participating in on-field batting practice during a workout day. Since the start of the playoffs, Ohtani is just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts, prompting questions about whether his return to pitching this season has affected his performance at the plate. While manager Dave Roberts acknowledged a potential correlation, Ohtani downplayed a direct link, stating he feels physically fine. He expressed his determination to improve, recognizing that his offensive contribution is crucial for the team's World Series aspirations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers while the government shutdown continues. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions after more than 4,000 employees received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the cuts were intended to target programs favored by Democrats. The order blocks any further termination actions against employees represented by the unions until a hearing for a preliminary injunction is held later this month.</p>

The detailed account was written by Lam Ping-yu, one of two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe during World War II. Lam's diary provides a vivid, firsthand perspective from aboard the battleship HMS Ramillies as it bombarded German fortifications on June 6, 1944.

          <p>The Last Dinner Party, winners of the BBC's Sound of 2024, are releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which they describe as darker and more gothically ambitious than their debut. Having written much of the material over Christmas, the band says they felt more confident and musically improved, allowing them to experiment with new sounds and longer song structures. Singer Abigail Morris reveals that some songs explore deep personal themes, including her teenage experience with the death of her father, reframing grief through the lens of heartbreak. The album reflects their rapid rise and artistic evolution.</p>
