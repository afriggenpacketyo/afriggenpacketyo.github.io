          <p>Brazilian counterintelligence is investigating a potential KGB operation where birth certificates were filed under fictitious names for future spies. The forensic analysis suggests the documents are not forged but were created during the Soviet era. This audacious possibility aligns with the Russian intelligence culture, which values long-term planning over immediate expediency. Intelligence experts find this forward-thinking approach consistent with Russia's commitment to deep-cover assignments, where obtaining authentic birth certificates is a priority.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, highlighting the importance of knowing when to step aside from power. He contrasts Souter's decision with the trend of many politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, citing examples like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Joe Biden. French argues that the desire to stay powerful is often fueled by enablers and a culture that defines people through their careers, emphasizing the need for leaders to prioritize deeper aspects of life and allow the next generation to take its turn.</p>

          <p>New research has shed light on what makes orange cats orange, identifying a unique genetic mutation. Two studies published in Current Biology identified a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange color. Scientists collected hundreds of cat DNA samples with the help of cat owners, who eagerly contributed to the research. The mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which gets turned on in pigment cells where it is not normally active, intersecting with the pathway responsible for red hair in humans.</p>
