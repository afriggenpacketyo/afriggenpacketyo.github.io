          <p>Recent clashes between India and Pakistan have become a testing ground for competing military technologies, with Chinese hardware facing off against Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's arsenal increasingly incorporates Chinese-made air and missile systems, drones, and fighters, offering a cost advantage compared to Western systems. This could reshape global defense procurement and strategic alignments, even if Chinese technology demonstrates only 70-80% of Western capabilities at 20-30% of the cost, creating a significant value proposition.</p>

The eventual winner will replace Andrzej Duda, a conservative and an ally of Law and Justice, who has used his powers to undermine Mr. Tusk‚Äôs plans.</p>

          <p>After winning the treble, there is a new era, new ambitions and there is new investment at Chelsea. Having smashed the world record transfer fee to sign USA defender Naomi Girma in January, she is likely to become a mainstay in the team next season after recovering from injury and returning to full fitness. Australia striker Sam Kerr is still to return following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Manchester United are one of those chasing, but manager Skinner knows they cannot compete financially - but what else can they do?</p>
