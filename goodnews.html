          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic to the Golden State Warriors with a final score of 89-84. Despite holding a double-digit lead in the first half, the Lakers' defense faltered, allowing 30 points in the third quarter. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while 2024 first-round pick Dalton Knecht struggled with his shooting. Bronny James, the team's highly anticipated rookie, traveled with the team but did not play in the game.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, delivering a polished show that noticeably toned down some of her racier lyrics and choreography for a more family-friendly audience. Despite the adjustments, the 26-year-old singer effectively charmed the crowd with a 17-song set of her biggest hits, including her breakout single "Espresso." The performance demonstrated her versatility and professionalism, solidifying her status as a major pop act. The article notes her long journey in the entertainment industry, from Disney star to her recent global chart success.</p>

          <p>British boxer Jack Catterall secured a victory over Harlem Eubank via a technical decision after their welterweight bout was stopped prematurely. The fight was halted at the start of the seventh round due to a severe cut above Catterall's right eye, which resulted from an accidental clash of heads in the sixth. As the fight had passed the required number of rounds, it went to the judges' scorecards, who unanimously awarded the win to Catterall. The result marks the first professional defeat for Eubank, the nephew of boxing legend Chris Eubank Sr.</p>
