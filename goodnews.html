          <h2>Labour Party Grapples with Election Setbacks and Strategic Direction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following disappointing local election results, Labour MPs are expressing concerns over the party's strategic direction, particularly regarding the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms. Some MPs believe reversing the winter fuel policy would signal that the prime minister understands public concerns, while others question its political benefit. The article highlights internal debates among Labour MPs, including frustrations from both critical and loyal members who feel Sir Keir Starmer needs to better communicate the party's strategic vision. A presentation by Pat McFadden is scheduled to address these concerns, focusing on the party's need to win over progressive voters in future elections. The Labour Party is also preparing for an upcoming UK-EU summit and immigration white paper, which could further influence their strategic direction.</p>

          <h2>Korean Women Divers May Have Evolved Genetic Adaptations for Diving</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study suggests that the Haenyeo women divers of Jeju Island, South Korea, have developed unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long practice of deep diving. These adaptations include a slower heart rate and genetic mutations that help them tolerate cold water and maintain lower blood pressure, even during pregnancy. Researchers compared the genomes of Jeju Island inhabitants to non-Jeju populations, finding two mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure. These findings could potentially lead to new medical treatments for conditions like stroke, as Jeju has one of the lowest rates of stroke mortality in all of Korea. The Haenyeo's cultural practice has helped them develop adaptations enabling them to dive longer than other humans.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have finalized a bilateral trade agreement that will reduce tariffs on key exports, including U.K. whisky and cars.

          <p>Rebekah Vardy has been ordered to pay over ¬£1.4 million of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their high-profile libel battle, dubbed the "Wagatha Christie" trial. A judge determined that Vardy must pay this amount after Rooney successfully defended herself against Vardy's High Court claim in 2022. The costs judge noted the "extraordinary expenditure of costs" by both parties and expressed hope that this would be the end of the matter. Vardy's barrister had argued that Rooney's costs were "grossly disproportionate," but the judge ultimately sided with Rooney, stating that Vardy was "the author of her own misfortune."</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact earnings this year. The company posted a net profit of 412 million euros ($466.3 million) for the first three months of the year. Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna highlighted the strong profitability driven by product mix and personalization demand. However, the company cautioned that the introduction of U.S. tariffs could reduce profitability percentage margins by 50 basis points.</p>
