          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 08:51:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government, under its new conservative-led coalition, is exploring a streamlined process to designate countries as safe origins to curb asylum seeker numbers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet has approved a draft policy that would allow such declarations via a simple statutory order, removing the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt framed this as a key component of a broader strategy to overhaul asylum procedures. However, opposition parties and NGOs have criticized the draft, citing concerns about its compatibility with German law and potential impact on asylum seekers' rights.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria has been given the green light by the European Commission and European Central Bank to join the Eurozone, potentially becoming its 21st member in 2026. Both institutions assessed that Bulgaria meets the necessary requirements for adopting the single currency. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the decision as a historic step that will bring more investment, trade, stability, and prosperity to Bulgaria. This positive assessment marks a significant shift from previous reports that cited Bulgaria's high inflation rate as an obstacle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that following the MIND diet, a blend of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The research, conducted by the University of Hawaii at Manoa, found that people aged 45 to 75 who adhered to the MIND diet were less likely to develop these conditions. The diet emphasizes leafy greens, berries, nuts, olive oil, and other brain-friendly foods. The focus is on building healthy habits over time and reducing consumption of processed snacks, sugary drinks, and alcohol.</p>

          <p>A report by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has criticized train companies for unfairly penalizing passengers for minor ticketing errors. The ORR found that Britain's fare system is overly complex and that rail firms are taking disproportionate action against travelers. The inquiry was launched after numerous passengers were prosecuted over small amounts of money, often due to genuine mistakes. The report recommends that rail firms should stop criminalizing innocent errors and adopt a more reasonable approach to fare enforcement.</p>

More people will qualify for the allowance, but specific details regarding the changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear. This announcement follows criticism of Labour's policy of restricting the payment to those on pension credit, a policy blamed for poor performance in recent local elections.

          <p>While paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, it's not the only factor, according to experts. Not all debt payments are reported to credit bureaus, meaning some on-time payments may not impact credit scores. For example, buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not be reported, and missing payments can negatively affect scores. Experts recommend checking credit reports to understand which payments are influencing credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>
