          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has made chess history by becoming the youngest female player to ever defeat a grandmaster in a competitive game. She achieved this record during the British Chess Championships by beating 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, is now being hailed as a remarkable talent in a sport historically dominated by men. Experts believe she is on a path to becoming a grandmaster herself and potentially a future world champion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The choice of Alaska for the summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is significant due to the state's deep historical and geographical connections to both the U.S. and Russia. Once a Russian colony before being sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska represents a unique intersection of the two nations' histories. Its strategic location, a former Cold War frontline, also provides a practical and symbolic backdrop for the high-stakes talks on the war in Ukraine. This neutral yet historically-charged territory offers a unique setting for diplomacy between the two world leaders.</p>

          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing artificial intelligence to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks in complex, human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training robots like "Ruby" by capturing data from humans performing tasks, teaching the machines to replicate actions with human-like precision and force. The goal is to move beyond single-task industrial robots to create versatile machines that can assist with household chores or in medical settings. Researchers emphasize that these AI-powered robots are tools designed to be safe and to augment human capabilities.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, their first update since 2017. The recommendations now suggest complete abstinence from alcohol, a shift from previous advice that allowed for moderate consumption. The guidelines also advocate for a more aggressive approach, recommending medication for individuals with systolic pressure in the 130-139 range if lifestyle changes alone are ineffective after three to six months. This approach aims to better prevent cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia by controlling blood pressure more effectively.</p>

          <p>Kristie Colton, a 28-year-old woman with a degenerative eye disease, is preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in October, guided by her two closest friends. Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age 9, Colton has refused to let her gradual vision loss limit her, having previously learned to snowboard and completed the Boston Marathon. She and her friends established a nonprofit, the Vorden Initiative, to train sighted individuals as athletic guides for the blind. The Kilimanjaro expedition, organized by a former paralympian, will feature eleven blind climbers aiming to conquer the nearly 20,000-foot peak.</p>

          <h2>An Analysis of Palantir's Rapid Growth and High Valuation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, pushing its market valuation past $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been its government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to its revenue, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio soaring past 280, dwarfing tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. This indicates that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its AI-powered software. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis of UK A-Level Results Shows Boys Outperforming Girls in Top Grades for First Time in Seven Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:33:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, reversing a long-standing trend. Boys secured 28.4% of top grades compared to 28.2% for girls, with the gap widening at the A* level. Analysts suggest this shift is partly due to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by significantly more boys and tend to award more high grades. While humanities subjects have declined in popularity, business and economics have seen a rise in entries.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for her invention designed to help homeless people. At age 12, she conceived the idea for a solar-powered blanket that stores heat during the day to provide warmth at night. The concept was developed into a working prototype by an engineering firm, and dozens of units have been distributed to a homeless charity in Glasgow. For her inspiring and impactful invention, Rebecca is being honored alongside nine other young women from around the world.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Exploration of the Evolving Concept of 'Genius'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:25:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical definition of "genius," tracing its evolution from an innate personal spirit in Roman times to a marker of exceptional, almost magical, talent in the 19th century. It examines how early attempts to scientifically explain genius, such as Francis Galton's work on heredity, were intertwined with the deeply flawed and racist ideas of eugenics. The author notes that while modern genetics acknowledges heritability in intelligence, it cannot fully account for genius, which is also shaped by social conditions, timing, and luck. The piece reflects on how our understanding and use of the word continues to change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece praises a new Department of Energy report for taking a middle-ground approach to climate change, acknowledging human contribution to warming without embracing apocalyptic narratives. The author argues the report, created by a small group of independent experts, injects nuance into a polarized debate by questioning the frequency of extreme weather events and the economic damage from warming. The article supports the report's call for open debate, suggesting that policies should be crafted from facts rather than fear, and that insisting "the science is settled" stifles important scientific scrutiny.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Choosing Between Debt Forgiveness and Debt Management</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:03:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the key differences between two major debt relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness, or debt settlement, involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, but it can significantly damage one's credit score and result in a tax liability on the forgiven amount. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, structures a repayment plan to pay the debt in full but with lower interest rates, which is less harmful to credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>
