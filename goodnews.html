          <p>A manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, once believed to be a copy, has been identified as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta by two British academics. Purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, the document is now recognized as one of only seven such originals in existence. The discovery, made by Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, was confirmed through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging, revealing matching text and dimensions compared to other known originals. The article notes the document's resurfacing during a time when Harvard faces political pressure, highlighting its significance as a symbol of the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, according to recent official data. The economy expanded by 0.7% from January to March, surpassing analysts' projections of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. The economy also saw a 0.2% increase in March, exceeding the forecast of zero growth, signaling positive momentum in the UK's economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, experiencing a boom due to pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in growth, though potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to significantly contribute to this slowdown, according to the IMF. The country's economic growth of 3.7% in 2024 is projected to decrease to 2.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth, including pharmaceuticals. The article notes that Denmark's reliance on a "merchanting and processing" system, where drug production is outsourced, shields it from direct impacts of U.S. tariffs, though broader trade tensions pose risks.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address soaring rice prices, which have reached near record highs. The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice monthly for three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned. This decision is driven by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.
