          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a Leicester, North Carolina resident named John Saunby is constructing a new home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. Instead of letting the debris go to a landfill, Saunby has repurposed items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards to build his dream house, incorporating unique elements like Black Locust bark siding. This project represents a personal and creative vision of resilience, turning the destructive aftermath of a natural disaster into a source of treasure and renewal.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to tackle the UK's asylum application backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart stated this would allow for the rapid establishment of temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and a doubling of asylum caseworkers. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to clear the backlog efficiently, end the costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers, and create a more humane and effective system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights the government secured as a condition of the company's recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel. The national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures, allowing the administration to force U.S. Steel to reverse its decision and keep the facility operational.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky discussed her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained her decision to reclaim her narrative was partly inspired by the tragic suicide of Tyler Clementi, hoping to become a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky noted the significant cultural shift, particularly among younger generations and in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has led to a re-evaluation of how young women were treated by the media and society.</p>

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) rays even while indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible signs like a burn. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended time near windows.</p>
