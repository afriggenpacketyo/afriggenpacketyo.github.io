          <p>The Japanese government is set to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its national stockpiles in an effort to combat rising prices of the country's staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the plan, which involves direct contracts with retailers, including smaller supermarket operators, to ensure broader access to affordable rice. This move follows previous auctions in March and April and aims to address rice prices that have doubled compared to the previous year. The government hopes this intervention will lower overall prices for consumers. </p>

However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that the government has not been transparent about the plant's costs and that the funds could be better allocated elsewhere. </p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the media conglomerate owning HBO and CNN, plans to divide its operations into two separate entities by mid-2026. The company will split its studio and streaming business, which includes HBO Max and its film division, from its traditional cable television networks like CNN and Discovery. This strategic move aims to allow each division to compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving media landscape, where streaming services are gaining popularity while cable TV audiences decline. David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery president and chief executive, believes this restructuring will provide sharper focus and strategic flexibility for the company's iconic brands. </p>

          <p>New government guidance in England encourages teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to save time on marking and administrative tasks. Training materials suggest that AI can help automate routine tasks, allowing teachers to focus on face-to-face interaction with students. The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking and that teachers must check the results. While the Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential benefits, it also highlights the need to resolve issues related to data breaches and marking errors. </p>
