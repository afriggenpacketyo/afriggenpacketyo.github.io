          <p>Following a request from the Department of Justice, Meta has removed a Facebook group page that was allegedly used to share personal information to target U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the DOJ will continue working with tech companies to eliminate platforms that incite violence against law enforcement. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group was removed for violating its policies against coordinated harm. This action is part of a broader trend, with Apple and Google having previously removed similar apps from their platforms.</p>

          <p>BlackRock's stock surged to a new record high following a third-quarter earnings report that exceeded analyst expectations. The asset manager's revenue rose 25% year-over-year, driven by successful strategic acquisitions and growth in alternative assets, private credit, and technology services. This performance validates the company's vision to become a "one-stop shop" asset manager, expanding beyond traditional stock and bond funds. The strong results, including a record $13.463 trillion in assets under management, have reinforced investor confidence in the firm's long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI is making aggressive strategic moves to control its entire business ecosystem, signaling a pivot toward vertical integration to dominate the artificial intelligence market. The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerator chips, similar to Apple's M-series, to optimize performance for its models. This, combined with massive infrastructure deals with Nvidia and AMD and an acquisition of a consumer hardware design firm, shows OpenAI is building a complete stack from silicon to consumer devices. This strategy aims to create a powerful, self-contained platform that is difficult for competitors to replicate or replace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The court's decision not to hear the case finalizes the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay to the families of the victims. During the original trial, relatives testified about the harassment and threats they endured from Jones' followers who believed his lies. Jones had argued the verdict violated his free speech rights.</p>

          <p>In a joint operation with U.S. authorities, the UK government has sanctioned two Chinese men accused of running large-scale scam operations in Cambodia and Myanmar that utilized forced labor. The men, Chen Zhi and Qiu Wei Ren, allegedly masterminded centers that tricked victims worldwide through romance and crypto scams. The sanctions freeze their extensive UK assets, including 19 London properties worth over £100 million, and lock them out of the UK financial system. This action targets the transnational criminal network and aims to protect vulnerable people and combat money laundering.</p>

          <p>As interest rates fall, homeowners may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to be an increasingly affordable borrowing option. With average HELOC rates currently below 8%, securing a rate around or under this benchmark is considered good in the current market. However, because HELOCs have variable rates, today's good rate could be considered high in the future if the downward trend continues. The article advises potential borrowers to maintain a strong credit profile and shop around with multiple lenders to secure the most competitive offer. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Zhi, who remains at large, for directing one of history's largest investment fraud operations.

While fire officials support these tactical measures for improving access during a blaze, some fire ecologists express concern that clearing native chaparral for fuel breaks could inadvertently lead to the growth of more flammable invasive grasses if not maintained properly.</p>
