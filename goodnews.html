          <p>Crystal Palace secured their first major trophy since 1861 by defeating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final, with Daichi Kamada playing a crucial role in Eberechi Eze's winning goal. Kamada, who previously won the Europa League under Palace manager Oliver Glasner, expressed his joy in making history as the first Japanese player in an FA Cup final. Henderson saved a penalty, and Crystal Palace held on to their lead, securing a spot in next season's Europa League and marking a trophy-less season for Manchester City for the first time since 2016-2017. Kamada emphasized the significance of the victory for the fans and his career.</p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a British mountain guide, has achieved a record-breaking 19th ascent of Mount Everest, surpassing his own record for the most climbs by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool first summited Everest in 2004 and has climbed it nearly every year since, with exceptions due to canceled seasons following the 2014 avalanche and 2015 earthquake. Nepali Sherpa guide Kami Rita holds the overall record with 30 climbs and is expected to summit again soon.

          <h2>Simple Brick Stacking Method Could Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that a simple change in brick-stacking techniques could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh. Traditional brick kilns contribute substantially to the country's high pollution levels, but researchers found that stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow, along with consistent fueling practices, can reduce fuel use by 23 percent. This would cut carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. The interventions also improve worker conditions and save kiln owners money, offering a feasible solution for reducing pollution in the region.</p>

While Europe expands its network to compete with short-haul flights, America struggles with underfunded rail systems and a car-centric culture. The author argues that revitalized railways offer an alternative vision for America, promoting community, connection, and a more sustainable future.</p>
