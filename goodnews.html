          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has rejected a substantial offer from Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal, despite considering the deal which would have more than doubled his current salary. After discussing the matter with his family, Fernandes informed Al-Hilal of his decision to remain with Manchester United, where he has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals since joining in January 2020. Manchester United is reportedly pleased with Fernandes' decision, particularly after head coach Ruben Amorim expressed confidence in Fernandes staying at Old Trafford. It remains uncertain whether Al-Hilal will now pursue alternative targets following Fernandes' rejection. </p>

          <p>The Klein Vision AirCar, a flying car decades in development, is nearing reality with certification expected later this year and customer deliveries planned for early 2026. This vehicle transforms from a road-legal sports coupe to an aircraft in about 80 seconds, requiring a runway for takeoff and landing, and offers a range of up to 620 miles in the air. It will be available with three engine options and will require both a driver's license and a private pilot's license to operate. Priced between $800,000 and $1.2 million, the AirCar targets wealthy travelers and air taxi services, with plans for future models including versions with more seats and an amphibious variant. </p>

          <p>A contributor argues that adding work requirements to Medicaid is a beneficial policy, citing past successes with similar rules in welfare and other government benefit programs. These requirements often provide a push and support network for individuals needing assistance entering the job market, and America Works, a job agency, assigns counselors to help participants with job placement and retention. While some participants may drop out due to personal challenges, those who maintain employment often gain confidence and structure in their lives, and the proposed Medicaid work rules exclude individuals with disabilities, mental health conditions, and adults with young children. The author asserts that existing workforce networks can provide job placement services, helping recipients move toward better economic prospects. </p>

          <p>A reissued book, "Los Angeles Before the Freeways: Images of An Era 1850-1950," curated and expanded by Nathan Marsak, presents a collection of photos by Arnold Hylen, capturing the city before its transformation by freeways. The book features black-and-white images of old adobe structures alongside Italianate buildings and homes on steep hillsides, accompanied by Hylen's essay documenting the city's cultural erasure. Marsak augmented the edition with additional text, notes, and previously unpublished photos, and Hylen, who photographed the city during World War II, aimed to chronicle the disappearing downtown area, especially Bunker Hill. Marsak hopes the book will inspire Angelenos to appreciate their city's history and consider preservation efforts. </p>

          <p>Jodie Marsh has won a court case against Uttlesford District Council, allowing her to keep lemurs at her private animal sanctuary, Fripps Farm, after the council refused her application for a wild animal license. The judge criticized the council for contradictory views and going against reports stating Marsh was a suitable keeper, and concerns had been raised about her taking a meerkat from her farm to the pub. Marsh, who founded the sanctuary in 2020, took the council to court after it did not allow her to adopt eight ring-tailed lemurs, and neighbors voiced opposition against her. The judge ordered the local authority to pay her ¬£19,641 in costs. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to 1.9% in May, falling below the European Central Bank's (ECB) 2% target, due to declines in services inflation, and economists had expected a 2% reading. The closely watched services inflation cooled to 3.2%, and core inflation also eased, with the latest figures being considered by the ECB as it prepares to make its next interest rate decision later this week. Markets are pricing in a high chance of interest rates being cut by 25 basis points, and the OECD expects the euro area to expand by 1% in 2025. Euro country bond yields were lower after the inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men, who avoided prison time but faced financial restitution and felony convictions, spotted the longline off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and freed the marine animals, believing it was an illegal fishing line. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman, but the pardons erase those convictions. The men had been ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms and traveling freely outside the U.S. </p>
