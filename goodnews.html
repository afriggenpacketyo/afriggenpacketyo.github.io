          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has offloaded a historic quantity of illegal narcotics at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, totaling over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana. Officials stated this is the largest cocaine seizure in the agency's history, with an estimated value of $473 million. The drugs were intercepted during 19 separate operations in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, involving collaboration with the U.S. Navy and the Royal Netherlands Navy. Authorities emphasized the seizure's significance, noting the amount of cocaine was enough to cause a fatal overdose for the entire population of Florida.</p>

          <p>A dramatic football match between Newcastle United and Liverpool has solidified their status as the Premier League's newest intense rivalry, culminating in a last-minute winning goal for Liverpool.

          <h2>Analysis: Why the U.S. and China Continue to Invest in Crewed Military Aircraft Despite Drone Advances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 18:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rapid advancements in autonomous drone technology that are reshaping modern warfare, major military powers like the United States and China continue to invest heavily in expensive, crewed systems such as sixth-generation fighter jets. This article explores the strategic reasoning behind this continued investment. While drones offer significant advantages in reducing human casualties and costs, military analysts believe that human decision-making, adaptability, and ethical oversight will remain central to critical combat operations for the foreseeable future. Drones are seen as redefining roles on the battlefield rather than completely replacing human pilots and soldiers.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has officially confirmed the return of its popular seasonal beverage, the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL), starting Tuesday, August 26. The coffee giant's fall menu will also feature other autumn-themed items, including a new Pecan Cold Foam, building on the success of its cold foam platform. The PSL, first introduced in 2003, has become a cultural phenomenon and is the company's most popular seasonal drink ever. The annual launch of the fall menu, which has been creeping earlier into August, is anticipated to provide a significant sales boost for the chain amid recent reports of weakening in-store traffic.</p>

The goal made him the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool's history and only the second 16-year-old to score a Premier League winner. Ngumoha, who joined Liverpool's youth setup from Chelsea last year, had already impressed during pre-season. His decisive finish, coming on as a late substitute, secured a crucial victory and marked a memorable arrival on the professional stage for the promising England Under-17 forward.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured a hard-fought victory in the first round of the US Open, defeating Federico Agustín Gómez despite struggling with on-court sickness. Draper, the fifth seed, won the match in four sets but was seen vomiting during the third set. He later attributed the illness to nervous energy and gut issues rather than a lack of physical fitness, as he returned to competition for the first time since an arm injury at Wimbledon. Draper also noted he is not yet serving at full power to manage the recovery of his arm but was pleased to advance in the tournament.</p>

During the meeting, President Lee requested Trump's assistance in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula. The discussion also touched upon a recent trade deal, with Trump acknowledging that South Korea might want to renegotiate but affirming his intention to stick to the agreed terms. The meeting occurred hours after Trump posted on social media about what he termed a "purge" or "revolution" in South Korea, a topic he briefly addressed before adopting a softer tone.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have reported a significant reduction in serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to recent years. Over the two-day event, 423 arrests were made for offenses including drug possession and carrying offensive weapons. While two stabbings occurred, neither resulted in serious injury, a marked improvement from the previous year which saw eight stabbings and one fatality. Police credited proactive measures, including the use of live facial recognition technology and stop-and-search powers, with preventing more severe incidents. The use of facial recognition, however, remains controversial among civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett clarified that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, is not looking to acquire another railroad but has explored increased cooperation with competitor CSX. Buffett told CNBC he met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss ways their respective rail networks could work together more efficiently, potentially achieving some of the benefits of a merger without an actual acquisition. This news followed a recent partnership announcement between Berkshire's BNSF Railway and CSX for a new coast-to-coast service. The comments quelled market speculation about a potential takeover, causing CSX shares to drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small craft store in Holdingford, Minnesota, has experienced a surge in visitors after the owner's 18-year-old grandson posted about it on Facebook Marketplace. Rosanne Forster, who has run Forster's Craft Corner for nearly 30 years, had seen business slow down recently. Her grandson, Tyler Larson, wrote a heartfelt post encouraging people to visit, even just for a chat, which quickly went viral. Forster, who has no internet access, was surprised and delighted by the influx of new customers who came specifically because of her grandson's touching gesture before he leaves for college.</p>
