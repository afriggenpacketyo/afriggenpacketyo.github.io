          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, marking a significant strengthening of the nation's nuclear capabilities. These jets will join NATO's airborne nuclear mission, which involves allied aircraft equipped with US-made B61 bombs stockpiled in Europe. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the investment in national security due to an era of radical uncertainty, and Defence Secretary Healey highlighted the strengthening of NATO's collective deterrent. The decision has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Rutte and is expected to support 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain, with the jets based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.</p>

The researchers emphasized that setting up such a system must navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000. The ABC has since apologized to Lattouf, acknowledging it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>China is expanding the use of the yuan for foreign institutions, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback weakens. The People's Bank of China is establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. While global finance institutions and investors have long been interested in diversifying to China, Beijing's strict controls on capital outflows and relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale buying of mainland China assets.

          <p>A proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was stripped from a Republican tax and spending bill for violating Senate rules. Senator Mike Lee's proposal to sell up to 3.3 million acres managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management was deemed extraneous to the budget. While the move initially appeared to scuttle the plan, Lee has indicated he will continue to pursue it with revisions.</p>
