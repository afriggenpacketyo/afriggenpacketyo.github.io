          <h2>Trump Restricts Funding for 'Gain-of-Function' Research Citing Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:49:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order restricting federal funding for 'gain-of-function' research, which involves experimenting with pathogens to understand their potential to cause pandemics. The move comes amid ongoing debate about the origins of COVID-19 and the risks associated with such research. The order blocks U.S. funding for gain-of-function research in countries of concern, such as China and Iran, and empowers American research agencies to identify and end funding for biological research posing a threat to public health. Supporters argue the restriction is necessary to prevent future pandemics, while critics worry it could hinder crucial research needed to respond to emerging health threats.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismantled some of the tents set up at Guant√°namo Bay to house migrants, just three months after the operation began. This New York Times article details that the operation never expanded to fulfill Trump‚Äôs vision of housing 30,000 migrants at the base. No migrants were ever held in the tents, and the operation is currently housing just 32 migrants in existing buildings. The decision to dismantle the tents indicates that the administration does not plan to house tens of thousands of migrants on the base, as originally envisioned.</p>

          <p>Several individuals are resisting the use of artificial intelligence due to concerns about its environmental impact, the loss of human connection, and the potential harm to critical thinking skills. Some worry that AI will benefit society long-term. However, some individuals are being forced to adopt AI in their work due to budget cuts and job requirements. One philosophy professor believes that the moment to opt out of AI has already passed and that AI will soon replace humans in some decision-making roles.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:08:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan to address concerns about its mission and control. The company will remain under the control of its non-profit board but will become a public benefit corporation. This update comes after criticism from co-founder Elon Musk and others who argued that OpenAI's pursuit of growth was compromising its original mission of benefiting humanity. The non-profit will receive a significant stake in OpenAI's business arm, providing access to funds for its goals, while the new structure will allow the company to raise money more easily.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to 8 years. The study, which examined over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events in those who received the vaccine. The protective effect was more pronounced in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, thereby lowering the risk of heart disease.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he considers one of the most important of his career, emphasizing the critical role oceans play in combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. This BBC article details how the film documents the decline of ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime and highlights the devastating impact of bottom trawling. However, it also offers a message of hope, showcasing the ocean's capacity to recover quickly with conservation efforts.

          <p>China's e-commerce giants, including Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan, are engaged in a fierce battle over "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. While Chinese consumers benefit from subsidized prices and quick service, investors are concerned about the lack of additional growth opportunities. The availability of millions of delivery workers and a robust transport network have enabled this model, but the intensified competition is causing stock prices to decline. Concerns have also been raised about the working conditions and social security of delivery couriers.</p>

The company's current list of events contracts for political outcomes includes options to bet on who will be the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees in 2028, which party will win the Senate race in Georgia, and who will be the Republican nominee for the governor of Ohio. Better Markets blasted the CFTC's decision to drop the appeal, calling it "a stark betrayal of the public interest."</p>
