          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a significant increase from the previous year. This boom is fueled by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, driven by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of mainland listings, and concerns about delisting from U.S. exchanges. The influx of capital has positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's leading listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for menopause hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, appears to reduce the risk. This research refines previous findings and underscores the importance of the type and timing of hormone therapy.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 19:37:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poised to set a record for player popularity and elite production, the Dodgers had eight finalists for the National League starting lineup in the 2025 All-Star Game as voted by fans.\n\nVoters had 48 hours to choose between the two players at each position who had accumulated the most votes over the last month in what MLB called Phase 1. Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani already was in the starting lineup because he led NL players in Phase 1 votes.\n\nWho in Blue would join him after Phase 2?\n\nMLB announced the winners Wednesday afternoon, and Dodgers catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman will start along with Ohtani. The other five Dodgers finalists ‚Äî second baseman Tommy Edman, shortstop Mookie Betts, third baseman Max Muncy and outfielders Teoscar Hern√°ndez and Andy Pages ‚Äî were outvoted and won‚Äôt start.\n\nThe record of five starting players held by the 1976 Cincinnati Reds, the 1956 and 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs, and the 1939 New York Yankees still stands. The Dodgers fell short, despite the bevy of finalists.\n\nIt is the ninth All-Star berth for Freeman, who is batting .308 with 21 doubles, and the third for Smith, who leads the NL with a .320 batting average and .419 on-base percentage. Both players have 10 home runs.\n\nEleven-time All-Star Mike Trout was the only Angels player among the American League finalists, and he did not finish among the top three outfielders in Phase 2. Thousand Oaks High product and Athletics rookie Jacob Wilson was voted the AL starter at shortstop, beating out Bobby Witt Jr.\n\nFinalists not voted as starters have no guarantee of making the All-Star Game as a reserve. Pitchers and reserves for the 32-man rosters will be determined by a vote of MLB players and the commissioner‚Äôs office.\n\nComplete rosters of 20 position players and 12 pitchers will be announced at 2 p.m. PDT Sunday on ESPN. The All-Star Game will take place July 15 at Truist Park in Atlanta. Managers Dave Roberts of the Dodgers and Aaron Boone of the Yankees have no say in the selections.\n\nBefore the Dodgers faced the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night, Roberts did say he hoped the number of All-Stars from his team would increase.\n\n‚ÄúI think they‚Äôve all had great first halves, and it‚Äôs great to know that three guys are starting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so hopefully we get a couple, two or three more. Really, good, really good.‚Äù\n\nThe teams that boasted a record five starters included Hall of Famers and also lesser-known players.\n\nThe ‚Äô39 Yankees had All-Star starters Joe DiMaggio, George Selkirk, Bill Dickey, Red Rolfe and Joe Gordon. Red Ruffing was named the starting pitcher by manager Joe McCarthy, making the ‚Äô39 Yankees the only team with six starting players.\n\nThe most recent team to land five All-Star starters was the ‚Äô76 Cincinnati Reds, known as the Big Red Machine, led by future Hall of Famers Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan. Pete Rose, Dave Concepci√≥n and George Foster also started.\n\nThe Reds were called the Redlegs from 1953 to 1959 because of a period of intense anti-communism in the U.S. To distance themselves from the Red Scare, the Reds temporarily changed their name.\n\nCincinnati fans loved their team by any name, casting a deluge of last-minute votes two years in a row that eventually required intervention from MLB commissioner Ford Frick and caused MLB to eliminate fan voting for more than a decade.\n\nFrick stood by the voting in ‚Äô56 despite complaints that five Redlegs were voted in, saying, ‚ÄúEverybody had a chance to vote, so there should be no squawks.‚Äù\n\nA year later he changed his tune when last-minute voting ‚Äî remember, all votes were handwritten and manually tabulated ‚Äî resulted in an all-Redlegs lineup. Frick swiftly stepped in and replaced three Redlegs with future Hall of Famers Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron.\n\nRedlegs fans were incensed, some making an effigy of the commissioner and driving it through Cincinnati tied to a truck. The reaction from players was more muted, with Redlegs center fielder Gus Bell saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly burned up about being replaced by Willie.‚Äù\n\nDodgers who finished second likely will have little quarrel with the results. Players who edged them out in voting are having excellent seasons: third baseman Manny Machado, shortstop Francisco Lindor, second baseman Ketel Marte and outfielders Ronald Acu√±a Jr., Kyle Tucker and Harvard-Westlake High product Pete Crow-Armstrong.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto (8-6, 2.51 earned-run average) of the Dodgers is a strong candidate to make the NL pitching staff. At least one Angels player must be chosen as a reserve or pitcher, and the nod could go to Trout, who has 13 home runs but is batting .230.\n\nOther possibilities for the resurgent Angels are catcher Logan O‚ÄôHoppe (17 home runs), shortstop Zach Neto (12 home runs, team-high 2.7 WAR), outfielder Jo Adell (18 homers, 44 runs batted in) and starting pitcher Yusei Kikuchi (2.79 ERA in 96.2 innings).\n\nMLB All-Star Starting Lineups\n\nNational League\n\nC: Will Smith, Dodgers\n\n1B: Freddie Freeman, Dodgers\n\n2B: Ketel Marte, Diamondbacks\n\nSS: Francisco Lindor, Mets\n\n3B: Manny Machado, Padres\n\nOF: Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs\n\nOF: Kyle Tucker, Cubs\n\nOF: Ronald Acu√±a Jr., Atlanta Braves\n\nDH: Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers\n\nAmerican League\n\nC: Cal Raleigh, Mariners\n\n1B: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays\n\n2B: Gleyber Torres, Tigers\n\nSS: Jacob Wilson, Athletics\n\n3B: Jose Ramirez, Guardians\n\nOF: Aaron Judge, Yankees\n\nOF: Riley Greene, Tigers\n\nOF: Javier Baez, Tigers\n\nDH: Ryan O‚ÄôHearn, Orioles</p>

          <p>North King Information Technology, a mainland Chinese fintech firm involved in the digital yuan project, has partnered with Hong Kong's GoFintech Quantum Innovation to develop stablecoin and virtual asset technology. The collaboration aims to build infrastructure for the stablecoin ecosystem, including developing secure hardware wallets. This move signals growing interest from mainland companies in Hong Kong's evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, as North King plans to use the city as a base for global expansion.

          <h2>U.S. and Vietnam Reach Trade Deal, Averting Higher Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will set tariffs on Vietnamese imports at 20%, avoiding a planned increase to 46%. As part of the deal, Vietnam will eliminate its own tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the administration claims is used to circumvent tariffs on Chinese products. This deal comes as many other U.S. trading partners are still negotiating to avoid upcoming tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>
