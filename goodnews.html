          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have announced a new ten-year, A$500 million ($328m) agreement to bolster security and economic ties, a move seen as part of Australia's effort to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific. The "Nakamal agreement" will fund projects including two data centers, climate change resilience initiatives, and security enhancements for the island nation. Leaders from both countries hailed the deal as a "win-win situation" that solidifies their relationship as "family." The agreement follows similar pacts Australia has recently signed with other Pacific neighbors like the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.</p>

The networking giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting earnings and revenue in line with or slightly above consensus estimates. CEO Chuck Robbins highlighted significant growth in AI-related infrastructure orders, which totaled over $2 billion for the fiscal year, more than doubling the company's goal.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Photos of rabbits with black, horn-like growths on their faces have gone viral, sparking alarm online, but Colorado wildlife officials have a scientific explanation. The animals are infected with Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively common disease spread by ticks and fleas that causes keratinous tumors to grow on the rabbits' heads. The virus is not transmissible to humans or other pets and is usually harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with their ability to eat. The phenomenon is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," a fabled rabbit with antelope antlers.</p>

          <p>Following an $8 billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his leadership team have laid out their plan to rejuvenate the media company. The strategy involves nearly doubling the studio's annual film output, focusing on major franchises like "Top Gun" and "Star Trek," and creating content for broad, non-politicized audiences. Ellison's Skydance Media and its backer RedBird Capital now control the company, which includes CBS and MTV, and plan to restore its status as a top destination for talent. The new leadership also secured a major deal for UFC streaming rights on Paramount+.</p>

          <p>An "outburst flood" from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier caused record-high water levels in Juneau, Alaska, before receding. The Mendenhall River crested at 16.65 feet, surpassing the previous record and threatening nearly 1,000 structures, prompting some evacuations. The flooding occurs annually when water from the glacier-fed Suicide Basin breaks through an ice dam, a phenomenon exacerbated by a warming climate. This year, temporary "Hesco" barriers were installed along the riverbank, which officials credited with preventing a catastrophic event by successfully mitigating widespread damage to homes.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that the practice of "bleisure," or blending business and leisure travel, is becoming increasingly common, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having family or friends join them on work trips. The trend is even more prevalent among C-suite executives, at 73%. Proponents cite the benefits of maintaining work-life balance, saving money on personal travel, and reducing the loneliness of being on the road. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a "policy grey zone," carefully separating expenses to ensure the company incurs no additional costs.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, a major step toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. The receiver now has the authority to seize and sell all company property, including the Infowars brand itself, with the process potentially beginning within days. This move shifts the case from federal bankruptcy court to state court, where attorneys for the families believe they have a better chance of a swift resolution. Jones decried the ruling on his show but may soon lose control of his platform.</p>

          <p>A large study from Sweden suggests that medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can significantly reduce the risk of adverse life outcomes. Researchers found that for newly diagnosed individuals, starting drug treatment was linked to lower rates of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The findings are based on data from nearly 150,000 people and provide evidence that the drugs' effects on impulsivity and concentration have tangible, long-term benefits. This research could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about beginning medication for the disorder.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. policies aimed at curbing China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Analysts suggest this move helps South Korean shipbuilders overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against China. HD Hyundai, a major Korean conglomerate, plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to ten vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs, with operations starting in 2026.
