          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago. The agreement stipulated he would guest-conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois on his 100th birthday. Unable to travel due to his health, Gabriel fulfilled his promise remotely, leading the band one last time from his home in Virginia. The heartwarming event celebrated his determination and commitment, as he emphasized that "your word is your bond," perfectly keeping time and inspiring those who witnessed it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent clinical trials in India are challenging the long-held belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two new studies suggest that consuming mangoes in moderation, particularly as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and metabolic health in individuals with type 2 diabetes. One study found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another showed improvements in key health markers like fasting glucose. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and clinical supervision.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is sparking conversation by depicting the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers-themed basketball jersey. The artwork, part of a larger tribute to the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win, adapts an iconic image of Bryant roaring with intensity. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while each location of the restaurant it's painted on features a Kobe mural, this one was altered to fit the Dodgers theme. The piece has generated mixed reactions, with many fans appreciating the crossover tribute to two Los Angeles sports icons, while others question altering the legendary purple and gold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her discussion of her fondness for the color orange, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns. Companies from United Airlines to Walmart quickly adopted the color in their marketing, aiming to align with the immense economic and cultural influence of the pop superstar. This phenomenon, known as brand-jacking, demonstrates the significant power Swift wields, as her Eras Tour previously generated substantial economic boosts for host cities. The widespread corporate response highlights a strategic effort to capitalize on her massive and highly engaged fanbase.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament has recommended that everyone in England under the age of 22 should receive free bus travel, mirroring a similar policy in Scotland. The proposal aims to help young people access work and education, as many currently struggle with high transportation costs that impact their budgets for food and rent. Young people interviewed by the BBC described bus fares as "extortionate," with some spending over £120 a month on travel. While the Department for Transport noted its existing funding for bus services, supporters argue the measure is crucial for youth independence and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Yavar Abbas, a 104-year-old veteran who served as a combat cameraman for the British Indian Army, has shared his extraordinary experiences from the Burma campaign during World War II. Despite detesting British imperialism, he enlisted to fight against Nazism and fascism, documenting key battles like Imphal and Kohima. At a recent VJ Day commemoration, he moved King Charles and Queen Camilla to tears with an impromptu tribute to the King's bravery during his cancer treatment. Reflecting on his service and the current state of global conflict, Abbas expressed that modern wars show humanity has "learnt nothing at all."</p>

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, years after its physical stores closed following the collapse of its parent company, Arcadia, in 2020. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand is set to open new standalone stores and will host its first catwalk show in seven years. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is strong among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. The relaunch aims to reclaim its status as a trendsetter with a distinct "London girl look."</p>

Despite the victory, the game highlighted defensive vulnerabilities for the reigning champions, as Bournemouth managed to equalize at 2-2 before late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah secured the win for Liverpool.</p>

This resurgence is encouraging a backlog of high-value private companies to prepare for public offerings, with Wall Street executives expressing optimism about a "healthy list" of IPOs for the second half of the year.

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by producing a simple, barebones pickup truck. The company's plan involves keeping manufacturing costs low on a compact, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's primary selling point has been its low price, which was initially advertised as under $20,000 with federal tax credits. With those incentives ending, the company faces the challenge of remaining competitive at a higher price point against established models like the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the pact, the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in control, rather than a federally appointed administrator from the DEA. This development followed a lawsuit filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move a "hostile takeover" and argued it exceeded the president's authority under the Home Rule Act. A federal judge had indicated she was prepared to issue a restraining order if the administration did not alter its plan.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The lawmakers argue that Trump has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required by the D.C. Home Rule Act to justify such a takeover. The resolution contends that the president's actions are a "lawless" attack on D.C.'s autonomy, based on a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate, which has actually declined. This legislative effort represents a formal challenge to what they describe as one of the most egregious incursions on D.C.'s self-governance in decades.</p>

The article suggests that Beijing could use this influence to push for constructive solutions, prevent major wars, and mitigate human suffering.
