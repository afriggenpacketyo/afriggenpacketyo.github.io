          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in London to continue trade talks, following a phone call between President Trump and President Xi. The U.S. delegation, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, aimed to address export controls on rare earth minerals. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed optimism for a swift resolution involving a "big, strong handshake" and the easing of U.S. export controls in exchange for China releasing rare earths in volume. China's Foreign Ministry asserted that the aircraft carrier's activities are consistent with international law and practices. Optimism surrounded the potential for a positive outcome, with expectations of eased export controls and increased rare earth mineral availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Guidance Allows Teachers to Use AI for Marking and Administrative Tasks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite marking and write letters to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks and free up time for face-to-face interaction. The Department for Education (DfE) advises transparency and careful checking of AI-generated results, limiting its use to low-stakes marking. While the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges AI's potential to enhance teaching, concerns persist regarding data breaches and marking errors. This initiative reflects a growing recognition of AI's role in education, balancing its benefits with the need for human oversight and data protection.</p>
