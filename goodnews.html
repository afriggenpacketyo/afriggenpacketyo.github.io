          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed concerns about Israel's intentions toward Iran, stating that regime change is not the primary objective. Instead, the focus is on dismantling Iran's nuclear program, which Herzog accuses of rapidly advancing towards creating a nuclear weapon. Herzog emphasized that while a change in regime could bring peace, the immediate goal is to eliminate the nuclear threat. He also mentioned ongoing back-channel talks and dialogue with world leaders to de-escalate tensions. Optimism that the situation can be resolved through diplomacy remains cautiously high.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court sided with a former middle school student who sued the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect her from bullying. The court upheld a $1 million jury verdict awarded to Eleri Irons, who was subjected to verbal and cyberbullying. The court found that the district was negligent in supervising and training its employees. The bullying began after Irons asked a friend if she could date her ex-boyfriend, and the harassment escalated despite the involvement of school officials.</p>
