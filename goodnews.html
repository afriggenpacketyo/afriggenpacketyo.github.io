Intrator emphasized that the company's financing remains robust, enabling them to repay lenders within contract terms. Despite investor concerns about debt and demand sustainability, CoreWeave continues to secure major technology clients like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI, indicating strong confidence in their business model.

          <p>Frank Bruni's New York Times opinion piece discusses how internal conflicts within the MAGA movement, exemplified by figures like Laura Loomer, could create problems for Donald Trump. Loomer's criticisms of other prominent Republicans and her demands on Trump highlight the fractious nature of his base. Bruni suggests that Trump's tendency to align with provocative figures, rather than those with sound policy ideas, could undermine his ability to govern effectively. The article also touches on the broader theme of resentment driving political conversations in America, as explored in Bruni's book, 'The Age of Grievance'.</p>
