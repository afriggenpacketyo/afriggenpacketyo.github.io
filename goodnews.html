        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally chaotic qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw numerous drivers crash on the difficult street circuit, including championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final segment. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, having set a fast time early, while Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson secured a surprise third position. The frequent interruptions and light rain created unpredictable conditions, challenging drivers and strategists throughout the dramatic qualifying event in Baku.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their 13th straight playoff berth following a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The win ties the second-longest postseason streak in MLB history and occurred during what was pitcher Clayton Kershaw's final regular-season home game of his career, as he recently announced his retirement. Kershaw, a franchise legend, received a no-decision after pitching 4.1 innings in the pivotal game. While the Dodgers have secured a spot in the postseason, they have not yet clinched the NL West division title, remaining focused on that next objective before turning their attention to the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina resident John Saunby is constructing a new home using materials he salvaged from the storm's wreckage. After his own home was damaged, Saunby found treasure in the debris, pulling porch posts from the wilderness and sourcing floorboards from a damaged cotton mill, saving them from a landfill. With help from his partner, musician Jenny Kimmel, he is realizing a long-held creative vision, incorporating unique elements like Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports. The project stands as a testament to resilience and resourcefulness in the face of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over a resilient French side. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two crucial tries in her return from a concussion. Although England scored first, France remained competitive, trailing by only 7-5 at halftime due to English errors. However, England's power and depth proved decisive in the second half, with their dominant driving maul and key tries from Amy Cokayne and Abbie Ward securing the victory. They will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham stadium.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in demonstrations across several German cities, focusing on the contentious issues of climate change and abortion rights. In Berlin and Cologne, marches were held by both anti-abortion groups, under the banner "March for Life," and pro-choice counter-protesters advocating for bodily autonomy. Simultaneously, climate activists from the Fridays for Future movement rallied against the government's energy policy and continued reliance on fossil fuels, particularly new gas-powered plants. These protests occurred as Munich kicked off its 190th Oktoberfest, the world-famous beer festival that draws millions of visitors to the Bavarian capital each year.</p>

          <p>The Mount Washington Cog Railway in New Hampshire, the world's first mountain-climbing railroad, provides a unique and scenic journey to the summit of New England's tallest peak. Built in the 1800s, the railway offers passengers breathtaking views, which are especially popular during the autumn for the vibrant fall foliage. The three-hour round trip ascends a steep grade, transitioning from dense, colorful forests to an open alpine zone with expansive vistas. While the weather can be unpredictable at the 6,288-foot summit, the clear, crisp days of fall make it an ideal time to experience this historic and innovative attraction.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime and national emergencies, to address the country's asylum backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart stated the party would establish temporary 'Nightingale processing centres' and double the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to 'get a grip' on the situation, which they frame as a crisis. This proposal is part of the party's broader focus on law and order at their annual conference, which also includes plans for more visible community policing.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indices achieved multiple record highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. This marks the first rate reduction since last December, with central bankers signaling the possibility of two additional cuts in the coming year. The move was highly anticipated by investors, who reacted positively, pushing the major indices to significant weekly gains.

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising new 'golden share' rights. These rights were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel, granting the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel informed nearly 800 workers of an impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warned the company the administration would not permit it, prompting a reversal. This marks the first use of these national-security-related powers, highlighting the administration's increasing direct involvement in the private sector.</p>

Lewinsky discussed how younger generations have re-evaluated her story with more empathy, recognizing the power imbalance at play. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, healing from past trauma, and finding humor in oneself as essential tools for survival and reclaiming one's identity.</p>

Following what both sides described as a productive conversation, Trump announced plans for the two leaders to meet at the upcoming APEC summit and for him to visit China early next year. The discussion covered key issues including trade frictions and the control of TikTok. Despite the positive signals, analysts remain wary, pointing to significant sources of friction such as tensions in the Taiwan Strait and potential U.S. tariffs over China's purchase of Russian oil that could undermine the momentum.</p>

Data shows a steady increase in U.S. students studying abroad, with consultants reporting a surge in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the primary motivation is financial, as tuition in many European countries is significantly lower than in the U.S., allowing them to avoid substantial student debt. For others, concerns about the domestic political landscape and a desire for an international perspective are driving their decision to pursue degrees overseas.</p>

Identifying a market gap for a safe, celebratory piercing experience, she founded the company on the principle of using trained, registered nurses for all procedures. After initially bootstrapping the business and facing skepticism from male investors, Rowan gained momentum through a viral social media post and successful funding rounds. The company, which became profitable in 2023, now operates 90 studios across the U.S., employs over 550 nurses, and generated over $70 million in revenue last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate the skin more deeply and are associated with accelerated skin aging and skin cancer. This 'silent' exposure can occur without any visible sign like a burn, as UVA rays can also pass through clouds. To stay protected, Dr. Friedman recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended periods near windows, and reapplying every two hours if outdoors.</p>
