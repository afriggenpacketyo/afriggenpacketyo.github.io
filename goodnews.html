          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to proceed with their case. The lawsuit alleges that the Saudi government provided support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers, a claim the kingdom has consistently denied. The case was bolstered by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act and recently declassified documents suggesting links between a Saudi official and two of the hijackers. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence of assistance, which Saudi Arabia has not sufficiently refuted.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that global demand, particularly from markets like China, is intrinsically linked to the deforestation caused by Indonesia's palm oil industry. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has initiated a campaign against illegal plantations, which cover at least 3.7 million hectares, aiming to reclaim vital forest areas. The author suggests that palm oil is not just a commodity but a reflection of civilization, where economic growth has often been prioritized at the expense of environmental destruction. The article posits that by leveraging its market power, China can play a crucial role in promoting more sustainable and responsible practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising reports of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests practical ways for workers to reduce on-the-job stress and improve work-life balance. Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," advises employees to utilize their "high energy time" in the morning for demanding tasks and save simpler activities for later in the day. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout, according to Wynn, is learning to set boundaries and occasionally say "no" to preserve one's own well-being.</p>

          <p>Emmanuel "Meme" del Real, the versatile keyboardist and vocalist for the iconic Mexican rock band Café Tacvba, is releasing his first solo album. The project was born from a period of quiet introspection after he moved from Mexico City to the more secluded Valle de Bravo. Del Real explains that the songs "arrived" organically without a formal intention to create an album, blooming from a process of solitary exploration and surrender to inspiration. The new music experiments with a range of genres, from electronic and bachata to futuristic boleros, reflecting a playful and honest creative process that he will preview at the Grammy Museum.</p>

          <h2>Dell Shares Dip as Weaker Third-Quarter Profit Outlook Overshadows Strong Results</h2>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock fall despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, driven by a 69% surge in its server business from AI-related demand. The company raised its full-year revenue and earnings forecast, but its guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below Wall Street estimates, causing investor concern. Dell attributed the back-loaded profit forecast to seasonality in its storage business, which saw a 3% revenue decline in the second quarter. The company announced it has shipped $10 billion in AI servers in the last two quarters and plans to double that figure next year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As seniors face rising costs and concerns about Social Security, managing healthcare expenses remains a primary challenge, as Medicare often does not cover all costs. This article outlines several options for filling these coverage gaps, including Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which can cover copays and deductibles. Other viable strategies for homeowners aged 62 and older include reverse mortgages, which provide access to home equity without requiring monthly repayments. For those concerned about future income, purchasing an annuity can provide a guaranteed stream of monthly payments to cover ongoing medical and living expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's Chief Financial Officer, David Zinser, confirmed that the semiconductor company received a $5.7 billion cash infusion from the U.S. government. The investment is part of a deal announced last week in which the White House will take a 10% stake in the company, though a press secretary noted that the final details are still being finalized. Zinser also indicated that Intel might seek outside investment for its foundry business to fund future growth. The news follows a recent stock drop for Intel due to concerns about the performance of its chip manufacturing unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a potential club-record fee. The move is significant as it could influence the future of Alexander Isak, who has been a transfer target for Liverpool. Newcastle had previously indicated they would need to secure two quality strikers before considering a sale of Isak. The acquisition of Woltemade, a 6ft 6in forward who scored 17 goals last season and was the top scorer at the recent Under-21 Euros, would be a major first step in meeting that condition.</p>

          <p>Data storage company Pure Storage saw its shares soar 32% to a record high after reporting strong quarterly earnings and raising its full-year guidance. A significant driver of the positive results is the company's new partnership with Meta, which has designated Pure as its key storage provider to meet the massive data needs of artificial intelligence applications. Pure has begun recognizing revenue from the Meta deal and expressed confidence in deploying one to two exabytes of storage for the tech giant this year. The company is also seeing increased interest from other large-scale "hyperscaler" clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have dropped to their lowest point of the year, making them a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners.

The article notes that with American homeowners' collective equity at a record high, there is a substantial pool of funds to borrow from.

          <p>Amazon is integrating fresh grocery delivery into its existing same-day service for Prime members in over 1,000 cities, with plans for further expansion. This move allows customers to order perishable items like eggs and produce alongside other goods for unified, rapid delivery from Amazon's specialized fulfillment hubs. The strategy leverages Amazon's extensive logistics network to enhance convenience and directly challenge traditional grocers and delivery services like Instacart and DoorDash. While analysts note that the initial selection of fresh items is limited, the expansion represents a significant long-term bet by Amazon to capture a larger share of the U.S. grocery market.
