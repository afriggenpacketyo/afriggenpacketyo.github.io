          <p>Ten years after their debut appearance, K-pop group Monsta X returned to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, showcasing their enduring appeal and strong group dynamic. The performance marked their first U.S. appearance as a reunited group following a two-year hiatus for South Korea's mandatory military service, a milestone that has often been a breaking point for other bands. Despite the absence of one member due to injury, the group delivered a powerful show, reaffirming their connection with a loyal fanbase. Their return signals a new era for the veteran group, which is preparing to release a new album.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows notable drops in violent crimes like murder, which fell by 14.9%, and property crimes, including a significant 18.6% decrease in motor vehicle thefts. While experts credit various factors for the decline, the report also notes a slight decrease in hate crime incidents, though some groups have seen increases in targeted offenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To protect tenants from extreme heat, Los Angeles County has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees. The measure, which passed with a 4-0 vote from the Board of Supervisors, addresses the rising public health risk of heat-related deaths amid climate change. While the law takes effect next month, enforcement will not begin until 2027, giving property owners time to comply, potentially through passive cooling methods like blackout curtains or reflective roofing. The ordinance reflects a growing trend of municipal governments enacting climate adaptation policies to safeguard vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>A partnership between a Los Angeles charter school and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land is demonstrating how replacing asphalt playgrounds with green spaces can have significant benefits. The new grass and plants at Camino Nuevo Charter Academy have cooled the playground's surface temperature by 40 degrees, creating a safer and more inviting environment for students. This initiative addresses the "concrete jungle" effect in many urban communities and tackles the issue of children staying indoors due to a lack of safe outdoor areas. The project highlights a nature-based solution to mitigate urban heat and improve children's well-being and development.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are turning to AI-powered chatbots, like a device named ElliQ, for companionship to alleviate social isolation. For retirees who live alone and have limited mobility, these AI companions offer interaction through conversation, games, and virtual activities, filling a significant void in their daily lives. While users report meaningful connections, some ethicists raise concerns that reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation if not deployed responsibly. However, for many seniors, the technology provides a valued and consistent source of engagement when human interaction is not readily available.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year deal worth $8.52 million. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection and the franchise's second all-time leading receiver, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move. His return provides a significant boost to the Chargers' receiving corps and reunites him with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he previously had a highly productive connection. The signing addresses a key need for the team following the recent retirement of another top receiver, Mike Williams.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced they will not pursue the death penalty against three high-profile alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. The decision, filed in a Brooklyn court, comes despite President Trump's calls for capital punishment for drug traffickers. This move is notable because Mexico, which has abolished capital punishment, typically requires assurances that its extradited citizens will not face execution. The decision spares the men from potential execution as they face charges related to large-scale drug trafficking, conspiracy, and, in Caro Quintero's case, the 1985 murder of a DEA agent.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with chemical manufacturer DuPont and its affiliates to resolve claims related to "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants. The agreement, the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history, holds the companies accountable for decades of contamination from four industrial sites. The deal mandates the creation of a $1.2 billion remediation fund for cleanup efforts and a separate $475 million reserve to protect taxpayers. This resolution follows a major lawsuit and is seen as a significant victory in holding polluters financially responsible for environmental damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant advances in accuracy, public trust in weather forecasting remains imperfect, a phenomenon a veteran meteorologist explores in a feature article. The piece explains that challenges arise from the "chaotic" nature of the atmosphere, where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, and the difficulty of predicting weather for very small geographic areas. A key issue is communicating complex, probability-based data in a simple format for TV or apps. The future of forecasting may involve AI, which promises greater accuracy but also presents new challenges in communicating an even greater volume of localized information.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they were irresponsible for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog determined that specific poses, lighting, and styling made the models look "gaunt" and emphasized "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. The ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting a continued regulatory focus on promoting responsible body image in advertising.</p>

With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary school children, many families face significant financial strain.
