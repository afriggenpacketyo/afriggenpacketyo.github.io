          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone later this month to bolster its naval defenses against growing pressure from China. Developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the drone will undergo combat capability evaluations. The defense ministry has allocated over NT$800 million for the project, with mass production expected to begin in 2026. The army intends to acquire more than 200 of these AI-enabled vessels to support coastal assault operations, enhancing Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. The article describes a defensive military development, suggesting a cautious but proactive approach to security, hence the optimism score reflects this.</p>
