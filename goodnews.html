          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption on Sunday, sending lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air and releasing volcanic plumes containing ash and Pele's hair. The lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, posing no immediate threat to residential areas. The US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported the eruption lasted for several hours, attracting tourists eager to witness the spectacle. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, with frequent eruptions since December 2024, and the USGS provides livestreams of the volcanic activity.</p>

          <p>Alexis Roderick Joel, wife of musician Billy Joel, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of love and support following Joel's diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. The family is thankful for the swift diagnosis and care received, as Joel will undergo physical therapy and has canceled concert dates through July 2026. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is relatively uncommon and usually treated with a shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. The family remains hopeful for his recovery and return to the stage.</p>

Hayley Matthews' brilliant 71 was not enough for the West Indies, as a rain delay disrupted their chase and Lauren Bell's game-changing wicket secured the win for England. Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 helped England post a total of 144-5, despite Matthews claiming 3-32 with the ball. A three-match one-day international series is set to begin on Friday, but Knight's fitness is uncertain due to a hamstring injury.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla arrived in Ottawa for a two-day visit to Canada, signaling support for the country amid rising tensions with the United States under President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won an election on an anti-Trump platform, greeted the royal couple. The King's visit includes delivering a "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament, expected to defend Canada's sovereignty and reject any US takeover attempts. The visit is seen as a diplomatic balancing act, as the King also maintains good relations with the US in his role as head of state of the UK.</p>

          <p>George Lucas is reasserting control over his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles as it approaches completion after years of delays. The museum recently parted ways with its director and eliminated several positions, with Lucas stepping in as head of "content direction." Questions remain about the museum's mission, described as exploring how narrative art influences societies, though some cultural leaders find the concept broad. The museum's collection will feature items amassed by Lucas, including illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings, in addition to memorabilia from his films.</p>

          <p>The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been detected in the United States, with symptoms similar to earlier strains, including respiratory issues and fatigue. Experts say the variant appears more transmissible but not more severe, though hospitalizations have increased in some regions. The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access, requiring new clinical trials for wider use, which could create confusion and reduce vaccination rates. Experts recommend prevention strategies like good hygiene and mask-wearing, while authorities in Hong Kong urge residents to mask in public places.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about reaching a quick resolution to the trade war with the US after President Donald Trump delayed his threatened 50% tariffs until July 9. The delay follows a "very nice call" between Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to fast-track negotiations. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed hope for the lowest possible tariffs, while Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is reportedly trying to organize a meeting between Trump and European leaders. The EU's "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, but Trump's flip-flopping has created uncertainty for businesses.</p>

After a 12-year investigation by a relative of one of the crew members, the wreckage was located, and a Navy dive team recovered remains and personal effects.
