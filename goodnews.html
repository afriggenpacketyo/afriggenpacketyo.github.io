          <p>The Greek government has launched "Kids Wallet," a state-operated mobile application designed to help parents monitor their children's screen time and verify their age on digital platforms. Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou emphasized that the app provides parents with a tool to protect their children online and confirm their ages when using social media. The app integrates with the government services platform, allowing parents to create accounts, set time limits for app and website access, and confirm their child's age through document uploads. The initiative aligns with EU plans to strengthen online protection for minors.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will restructure as a public benefit corporation, ensuring its nonprofit parent organization retains control of the company. This decision follows discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware and addresses concerns from civic leaders and former employees. The nonprofit will be OpenAI‚Äôs largest shareholder, and the company is still negotiating the specifics of the nonprofit‚Äôs stake in the new corporation and the selection process for board members. This move is seen as a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued the company was overly focused on profits.</p>
