The new president will immediately be sworn in for a five-year term, facing challenges including a slowing economy, President Trump's trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Lee has preached patience over Trump's tariff policy, while Kim has expressed a desire to meet with Trump quickly. </p>
