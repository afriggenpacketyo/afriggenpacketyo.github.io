During a visit by President Vladimir Putin to Beijing, the two nations signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, technology, and agriculture. This collaboration is driven by Russia's need for consumer goods and machinery due to Western sanctions, and China's strategy to find new markets amid trade tensions with the United States. The new deals underscore a deepening alliance as both countries seek to counter U.S. economic pressure.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York who has served in Congress for 34 years, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026. The 78-year-old lawmaker cited the need for a "generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary motivator for his decision, influenced by the events surrounding Joe Biden's 2024 presidential campaign. Nadler, who played a key role in both of President Trump's impeachments as the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested other aging Democrats should also consider stepping aside. His retirement is expected to open up a competitive primary for his seat.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, a 42-year-old London Assembly member, has won the UK Green Party's leadership election, promising a more confrontational communication style and an "eco-populist" movement. Beating two of the party's sitting MPs, Polanski aims to shift the party decisively to the left and directly challenge the Labour Party. With a background as an actor and hypnotherapist, he represents a move away from the party's more traditional leadership. His victory signals a potential for collaboration with other left-wing movements and a focus on connecting with voters' anger over inequality and the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Biologists are experimenting with a novel, non-lethal method to protect cattle from gray wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast heavy metal music, movie scenes, and human voices. This technique, developed by the USDA, aims to haze the predators by startling them with unfamiliar sounds, successfully interrupting wolf hunts in preliminary studies. The approach offers a creative solution to the increasing conflict between ranchers and the recovering wolf population in the western U.S. While its long-term effectiveness is still being evaluated, it represents an innovative step towards human-wildlife coexistence.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, banking experts are advising savers to make strategic moves with their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts this September. Key recommendations include locking in current high rates before they drop and considering no-penalty CDs, which offer flexibility for withdrawals despite slightly lower returns. Experts also caution against locking up too much cash in long-term CDs, suggesting a "CD ladder" approach to maintain liquidity. Finally, they emphasize the importance of shopping around at various financial institutions, as rates and terms can differ significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that President Trump's latest tax legislation presents a "golden opportunity" for many investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains. The bill's new deductions for 2025 could allow more individuals to fall within the income thresholds for the zero-tax bracket, which applies to single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and joint filers up to $96,700. This creates a window for "tax-gain harvesting," where investors can sell profitable assets without incurring taxes. This strategy can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for potential future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, Russell Marubbio has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on DNA analysis that distinguished him from his identical twin brother. Investigators used advanced genetic genealogy to trace a 37-year-old DNA sample to the twins. Scientists then employed ultra-deep sequencing to identify minute, acquired genetic mutations that are unique to each twin, definitively linking Russell Marubbio to the crime scene evidence. This is the first time this specific technique has been successfully used in a U.S. court, setting a precedent for solving complex cases involving identical twins.</p>

Rowan points to the rapid growth of private credit, which has stepped in as bank lending has become more regulated, as a key area for investment.
