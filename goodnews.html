          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discussed her highly anticipated new film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to convey the "primal" and "sexual" feeling she first experienced reading the book as a teenager. Speaking in Brontë's home town, Fennell, known for "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn," revealed her intention to fulfill her 14-year-old vision for the story, even incorporating risqué additions she thought she remembered from the novel. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film, with its "heightened and highly stylised gothic approach," promises a unique and intense cinematic interpretation of the turbulent romance.</p>

          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek and tech giant Huawei are spearheading efforts to reduce China's reliance on US chip technology. DeepSeek's recent shift towards supporting domestically produced chips stunned Nvidia investors, while Huawei showcased new Ascend chip series offerings designed to deliver world-class computing power without Nvidia processors. These developments highlight a significant wave of innovation in China's domestic AI industry, largely spurred by US trade restrictions imposed in 2019 over national security concerns. Beijing is now actively urging its tech giants to cease buying US-tailored chips, intensifying the tech rivalry with Washington.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new gene therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75%, offering immense hope for patients and their families. Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed in 2011, described the news as "like winning the lottery 10 times over," as it fundamentally changes the prospect of growing old with her husband and seeing her children become adults. While the treatment is still in early stages and faces regulatory hurdles for NHS availability, scientists believe it's a monumental breakthrough with potential broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and dementia.</p>

          <p>King Charles's urban planning ideas, once controversial and criticized by the architectural establishment, are now inspiring the next generation of new towns in England, with an announcement from the government imminent. The housing ministry's head of placemaking outlined plans for 12 new towns that will be walkable, environmentally friendly, and feature "gentle density" housing like terraced homes rather than high-rises. TV architect George Clarke notes a significant shift in architectural consensus, with younger architects embracing the King's emphasis on traditional designs, local materials, and community-focused public spaces. These principles aim to create high-quality, sustainable communities, learning from the failures of post-war new towns.</p>

Danyah, a performer, found content creation addictive and mentally draining. The article highlights the intense demands, self-worth impacts, and unexpected benefits of navigating the lucrative but unforgiving creator economy.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio, in partnership with the organization Hey Brother, offers a unique "Men's Work" program where over a dozen teen boys can openly discuss their emotional struggles and the evolving role of men in today's world. Founder Johnny Cole notes that boys often feel a "push and pull" regarding emotional expression, lacking adult male role models who demonstrate vulnerability. The program aims to discuss and challenge messaging from the "manosphere," which frequently pressures boys to be physically strong. This initiative provides a vital and loving space for young men to navigate complex emotions and societal expectations, addressing a critical gap in mental health support.</p>

          <p>At a Philadelphia Phillies game, 9-year-old Jameson Pennings, after successfully catching a prized foul ball, overheard a woman hoping to get one for her 80-year-old mother, Donna Morey. Realizing the slim chances for an older fan to receive a ball, Jameson selflessly walked over and gifted his cherished possession to Morey, who was "so shocked" and didn't know what to say. Jameson explained his reasoning, believing she couldn't attend many more games, while he could get more. Morey deeply cherished the gesture, stating it "symbolizes goodness in this world," and Jameson himself felt happier without the ball.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated millions for decades. While the widely accepted theory is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan crashed into the Pacific after running out of fuel, various unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was captured by the Japanese on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands territory specifically requested the declassification based on "credible, firsthand accounts" of her being spotted on Saipan. However, experts like journalist Laurie Gwen Shapiro dismiss spy theories as "nonsense," attributing the disappearance to simple fuel exhaustion.</p>
