          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.  The case, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift in the U.S.'s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, particularly given the Trump administration's apparent pro-crypto stance and the Justice Department's disbanding of its crypto enforcement team.  The move signals a potential end to one of the most aggressive crypto crackdowns in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, founder of the notorious Gangster Disciples street gang.  Hoover, 74, was serving multiple life sentences for various crimes, including conspiracy, extortion, and drug trafficking.  While Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he continued to lead his gang from prison. This commutation is part of a larger series of clemency actions taken by the president.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals a slightly improved outlook on the U.S. economy compared to winter, although overall sentiment remains negative. While more Americans plan summer vacations than last year, financial concerns and stress are more prevalent than feelings of security.  The poll highlights a disparity between higher-income earners, who feel more financially secure, and lower-income individuals, who experience greater financial stress.  The study underscores the ongoing impact of inflation and income inequality on Americans' financial well-being.</p>

The appeals court issued a stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect while Trump's appeal is considered.

          <p>A California court ordered Sable Offshore Corp. to cease further construction or repairs on its offshore oil pipelines until it obtains necessary permits from the California Coastal Commission.  Sable had argued that its work constituted maintenance, not new construction, and thus didn't require new permits. The court sided with the commission, finding that the work constituted “development” under the Coastal Act. Sable plans to appeal the ruling, while the Coastal Commission celebrates the decision as a victory for environmental protection and the rule of law.</p>
