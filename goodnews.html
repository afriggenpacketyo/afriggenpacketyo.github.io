          <p>A recent World Bank report indicates that Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, primarily driven by the oil and gas sector recovery and tech and finance industry expansion. Despite this growth, poverty levels remain high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, making it the country with the second-largest poor population after India. The report also highlights the negative impact of insecurity in the Middle Belt region on the agriculture sector, contributing to slow growth and exacerbating inflation, which is expected to remain above 20% throughout the year. President Bola Tinubu's government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, have been praised but have also led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians.</p>

Captured in 1966, Peterson spent six and a half years in captivity, enduring brutal interrogations. Upon his return to the United States, he made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to positive change, which led to his appointment as ambassador by President Bill Clinton in 1997. Peterson credits his open and transparent approach for helping to forge a new diplomatic relationship, overseeing a key trade agreement and initiating the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the complexities of determining who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs, highlighting that changes in health, rather than weight alone, should be the primary goal. It emphasizes that visceral fat, which accumulates around the waist and organs, is more dangerous to health than subcutaneous fat. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat and improving metabolic health, making them most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat and related health consequences. The article also critiques the use of BMI as the primary metric for judging and distributing anti-obesity drugs, advocating for more accurate measures of visceral fat and insulin resistance.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess the costs and progress of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington. The Department of Transportation confirmed that the Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted for a new engineering contract, with the goal of finding ways to build the tunnel more cheaply and efficiently. This move raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's leadership roles in multiple companies and his advisory position to President Trump, particularly as he oversees the Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut resources at federal agencies that regulate his businesses. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel is intended to replace the 152-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, but its estimated cost has increased to $8.5 billion, prompting the search for cost-saving measures.</p>

He stated that the United States will no longer subsidize the healthcare of foreign countries and that some drug prices will be reduced by 50% to 90% almost immediately. This move expands on his previous "most favored nation" idea, aiming to pay the lowest price in the world for prescription drugs.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled their plans for a comprehensive tax bill that would temporarily enact President Trump's campaign pledges, including not taxing tips or overtime pay, while also rolling back subsidies for clean energy and creating a new tax-advantaged investment account for children. The bill aims to extend several provisions from Trump's 2017 tax law but faces criticism from some Republicans over the proposed limit on the state and local tax deduction. To offset the costs of the tax cuts, Republicans plan to raise taxes on certain sectors, including those related to President Biden's clean energy agenda and university endowments, and impose a new tax on remittances sent overseas. The legislation is expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to understand why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The US team, working on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota, is constructing vast underground caverns to shield their detectors from external noise and radiation. The goal is to observe slight changes in these particles as they travel, potentially revealing why matter and antimatter did not cancel each other out after the Big Bang. Meanwhile, Japanese scientists are constructing Hyper K, an enhanced version of their existing neutrino detector, aiming to be operational sooner and potentially make a groundbreaking discovery about the origin of the Universe.</p>

The Museum of Survivors, housed in a renovated spinning mill, displays the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, the L√∂w-Beer family, and Holocaust survivors. Daniel L√∂w-Beer, whose family owned the plant before it was stolen by the Nazis, spearheaded the project. The museum includes exhibitions, lectures, film screenings, and concerts, with a glass wall separating the renovated area from the still-ruined parts of the site.</p>

          <p>American Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric, is set to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The company aims to mine bitcoin "below market cost" and build a reserve of the cryptocurrency.
