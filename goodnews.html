          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit series "Dallas," revealed she was unaware her character was being written off until her last day on set. She now realizes a scene where her character was packing a suitcase should have been a clear indicator of her departure. Despite her initial heartbreak at not being part of the show's final season, Stock holds no hard feelings and has fond memories of the cast, including stars Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. After leaving acting in the early 2000s to focus on her family and a new career in interior design, she has no regrets about her decision.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on how his upbringing in Sacramento, California, shaped his judicial philosophy. He writes that the West taught him the importance of economic freedom, personal liberty, and treating people as individuals beyond their background. Kennedy describes his unexpected path to the judiciary and his hope that his Western perspective, with its emphasis on community, tolerance, and dignity, guided him in his long service on the nation's highest court. The memoir aims to explain his journey and his commitment to the nation's founding principles.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Allen White, star of the acclaimed series "The Bear," is taking on the role of Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's 1982 album "Nebraska," a period when the musician was experiencing significant personal turmoil. White discusses the challenge of portraying the iconic artist, his deep dive into Springsteen's struggles with mental health, and how he found common ground with the musician's feeling of being an observer in his own life. He reflects on his own journey with acting and his approach to the intense pressures of fame.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a recent interview, expressed concern that the current Court has become "a little bit too personal and confrontational." While promoting his new memoir, the 89-year-old former justice, who was often the Court's swing vote, reflected on his legacy and the recent reversal of key precedents he helped establish, such as Roe v. Wade. Kennedy emphasized the importance of civility and rational discussion in public life, warning that its absence puts democracy in danger. He stood by his past decisions, including those on abortion rights and the legalization of same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages and that their release is anticipated within the next 24 hours. This development is seen as a major step towards peace in the Middle East, prompting President Donald Trump to schedule a visit to Israel and Egypt to mark the occasion. Vance stated that U.S. diplomats have been instrumental in brokering the deal, which is part of a broader ceasefire agreement. He also clarified that while some U.S. troops are being sent to a coordination center in Israel, there is no intention for them to enter Gaza.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 10:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study found that over 40% of U.S. employees have received AI-generated content, dubbed "workslop," that appears competent but lacks real substance. This article argues that the responsibility for this decline in productivity lies not with AI technology itself, but with employers. It posits that many businesses fail to invest in proper training, establish clear AI policies, or develop strategic plans for implementation. Instead of being a magical solution, AI is a tool that requires investment in the people using it to be effective, and the failure to do so is what ultimately produces low-quality output.</p>

          <p>The United States has a rich history of invention, a phenomenon this article explores by examining figures like Thomas Edison and modern entrepreneurs. It highlights that Edison's success was not just a lone genius moment but the creation of an "invention factory" that fostered collaborative systems. This spirit continues today, fueled by a unique ecosystem that includes a pioneering immigrant spirit, government support for venture capital, and a culture that glamorizes entrepreneurship. Unlike in many other countries, failure is often seen as a learning experience rather than a permanent mark, allowing innovators to persevere and ultimately succeed.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. It argues that one can separate the art from the artist by critically engaging with the work's positive messages about rejecting discrimination, while also acknowledging its flaws and the author's harmful statements. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively interrogate the text in community with others. This approach allows for continued appreciation of the series while fostering a more nuanced and socially conscious fandom.</p>
