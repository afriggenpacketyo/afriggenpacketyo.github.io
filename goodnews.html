          <p>Ten years after Angela Merkel's declaration of "wir schaffen das," Germany is reflecting on its migration policies and their consequences. While many refugees have integrated into the workforce, unemployment rates among migrants remain high. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has distanced himself from Merkel's approach, emphasizing the need to control immigration and ensure integration. In related news, authorities are searching for far-right activist Marla-Svenja Liebich, who is evading a prison sentence, raising concerns about abuse of Germany's Self-Determination Act, which allows adults to legally change genders and first names on official records. Despite challenges, the country continues to address integration and extremism.</p>

          <h2>Biologists Use Drones and Music to Protect Cattle from Wolves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 01:18:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists are employing drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from preying on cattle near the California-Oregon border. The drones broadcast sounds such as AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," movie clips, and human voices to scare away the wolves. This innovative approach aims to reduce conflict between ranchers and the growing wolf population, which has led to livestock losses. While environmental advocates are optimistic about the use of drones, some ranchers remain skeptical about its long-term effectiveness and seek permission to lethally control wolves in certain situations.</p>
