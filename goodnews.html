          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a significant tax and spending package into law, introducing substantial changes for American taxpayers. The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent and includes several new provisions aimed at different demographics. Key elements of the bill include a "bonus" for seniors, an increased state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a higher exemption for estate and gift taxes. Additionally, the package provides tax breaks for tip income and overtime pay, and establishes a new tax-advantaged savings account for children, representing a broad overhaul of the existing tax framework.

          <p>A hiker in the Swiss Alps was successfully rescued after falling 26 feet into a glacier crevasse, thanks to his long-haired Chihuahua. The man managed to make a distress call on a walkie-talkie, but rescuers from Air Zermatt had difficulty locating his position on the vast Fee Glacier. A rescue specialist spotted the tiny dog moving on a rock, perched right next to the hole where its owner had fallen. The dog's unwavering presence at the site allowed the team to pinpoint the man's location and perform a successful rescue, with the service hailing the Chihuahua as a four-legged hero.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's persistent public criticism and pressure on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, economists assert that his actual power over the central bank is limited. The Fed is structured to be an independent, nonpartisan institution, with decisions on interest rates made by a 12-member committee, not solely by the chair. While Trump can appoint some members over time, his immediate influence is minimal. Economists warn that undermining the Fed's independence, as seen in some other countries, could lead to severe economic problems like high inflation and unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder made a surprising decision during a Test match against Zimbabwe, declaring his team's innings while he was personally on a score of 367 not out. This left him just 33 runs short of breaking Brian Lara's legendary record for the highest individual score in Test cricket, which stands at 400. Mulder, captaining for the first time, prioritized the team's strategic position over his personal milestone. His score is now the fifth-highest individual innings in Test history and the highest ever by a South African player.</p>

          <p>The British government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass, is seen as a significant step in legally recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach, a former undocumented immigrant from Peru who has rapidly risen in Democratic leadership. Now in a key role on the House Oversight Committee, Garcia is positioned as a primary antagonist to the Trump administration. His personal story, from learning English with Superman comics to becoming a U.S. citizen and mayor, informs his unabashedly inclusive and fair vision of America. Garcia's confident and combative style reflects a growing sentiment within the Democratic party for new, aggressive leadership that can effectively challenge the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>A classic sibling rivalry has erupted on social media between UCLA and UC Berkeley, with both campuses claiming to be the No. 1 public university. The dispute began after U.S. News & World Report's latest global rankings placed Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting celebratory posts. UCLA quickly countered by citing a separate U.S. News national ranking from nine months prior that named it No. 1, a title it has held for years. The playful but pointed banter has engaged fans and alumni, highlighting the competitive spirit between the two prestigious University of California campuses.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles food writer details their quest for the perfect french fry, expressing a long-held disdain for thick-cut steak fries in favor of their skinny, crispy counterparts. After years of considering the truffle Parmesan fries at Chateau Marmont to be the city's best, a new contender has emerged. The article praises the "Apennine fries" at Rossoblu, an Italian restaurant in the Arts District. These thicker, triple-cooked Kennebec potato fries, tossed with herbs and balsamic vinegar, achieve a mind-bogglingly crunchy texture that challenges the author's belief that only skinny fries can be superior.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," offers a satirical look at the world of arts criticism through the story of two newspaper critics at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The anti-hero, Alex Lyons, is a notoriously harsh theater critic whose life unravels after he gives a one-star review to a performer he then sleeps with. The performer, Hayley Sinclair, turns her show into a public takedown of Alex, creating a national sensation. The story, told from the perspective of Alex's junior colleague, is a snackable and entertaining commentary on the power, ego, and potential corruption within the critic profession.</p>

In a recent interview, the Tacoma-bred comic explains that his improvisational style developed from hosting a weekly comedy show where he needed fresh material constantly. While he prides himself on his written jokes, he acknowledges that organic, in-the-moment interactions often connect more deeply with audiences. He views his ability to weave audience stories into a structured comedic set as an evolution of the stand-up art form.</p>
