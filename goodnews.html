          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to license credit scores directly. This change aims to eliminate mark-ups by credit bureaus, which previously held a near-monopoly on distribution. While Fair Isaac plans to offer both pricing models to credit bureaus, the news caused significant drops in the stocks of Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte praised the move as a creative solution benefiting American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by subsidiary Endeavor Air, had a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway. Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck Flight 5155, scheduled for Roanoke. Preliminary information indicates Flight 5155's wing contacted Flight 5047's fuselage, causing damage to both aircraft. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was hospitalized. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, recovering flight recorders for analysis, but airport operations were not impacted.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has called on his X followers to cancel Netflix subscriptions, citing a "transgender woke agenda" linked to the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park." The controversy stems from conservative backlash against the show, which features a transgender character and was canceled in 2023. While the show's creator, Hamish Steele, acknowledged the "odd day," analysts believe Musk's boycott call is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's substantial subscriber base or market capitalization. This article notes that similar boycotts, like the one against Bud Light, have varied in their destructive power.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, preventing a potential blackout of popular channels for millions of customers. The resolution came after intense negotiations, where YouTube TV reportedly backed away from demands to include Peacock programming at no extra cost. This article notes that both companies, motivated to avoid customer backlash, clinched a deal after their previous pact expired. The agreement follows recent resolutions for YouTube TV with Fox Corp. but contrasts with an ongoing standoff with TelevisaUnivision.</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow against their equity can now expect lower monthly payments for a $90,000 home equity loan, thanks to recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This article calculates that a 10-year loan at 8.34% would cost $1,108.18 monthly, and a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be $871.03. These figures represent a decrease compared to rates earlier this year and last year. While rates are more favorable, the article advises careful consideration due to the substantial amount and the home serving as collateral, suggesting a comparison with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs).
