          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened past 7.1 per US dollar for the first time in nearly a year, reaching 7.0999, ahead of the US Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts this week. This marks a significant development in China's monetary policy, contributing to the yuan's gradual gain over the past month. Economists predict that the Fed's easing will likely further depreciate the US dollar, consequently leading to greater stability and strength for the yuan. This shift could have notable implications for global trade and financial markets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a modest 0.1% year-on-year in August, a smaller decline than the 1.9% expected by economists, primarily due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. Despite this improvement, overall export growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month. Exports to Western Europe also saw a sharp increase, partially offsetting a steeper fall in shipments to the US. This article notes that while the headline figures are better than anticipated, export volumes could still shrink in 2026 due to slower external demand.</p>

          <p>Beyond the multi-billion-dollar business deals, the UK government hopes to achieve three key objectives from President Trump's state visit. Firstly, it aims to finalize and refine the existing US-UK trade deal, particularly pushing for the elimination of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum exports. Secondly, the visit is seen as a crucial confidence boost for Britain's beleaguered government, which has faced recent political turmoil and accusations of harming business sentiment. The UK seeks to project unity and global player status through this "special relationship."</p>
