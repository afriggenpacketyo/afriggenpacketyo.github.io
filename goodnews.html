          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship, decisively defeating American Amanda Anisimova in the women's final. The match was remarkably one-sided, with Swiatek winning in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0, in under an hour. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth major trophy, adding a grass-court Grand Slam to her previous wins on clay and hard courts. For Anisimova, reaching the final was a significant achievement after taking a career break in 2023 to focus on her mental health.</p>

          <p>A portion of Southern Boulevard in Florida, a key route leading to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, is set to be renamed in his honor. Palm Beach County commissioners unanimously approved the measure to change the name to "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The roadway is frequently used by Trump's motorcade and lined by his supporters during his visits. This honor follows a tradition in the county, which already has roads named after former presidents George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a nationwide wave of violence. His escape and the subsequent gang warfare led Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." Macias's agreement in court marks a significant step in Ecuador's efforts to combat organized crime with U.S. cooperation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, some companies are utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs. These zones allow businesses to import materials and components duty-free, with taxes only being applied once the finished products enter U.S. commerce. This strategy provides significant cash flow benefits by delaying or reducing duty payments. However, a recent executive order by President Trump eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit for FTZs, which previously allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on finished goods, complicating this approach for manufacturers.

By focusing on slow, deep growth in regional markets rather than rapid expansion, he built a strong brand identity. Today, Ithaca Hummus is sold in over 8,000 stores nationwide.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, posing a significant challenge to long-held U.S. leadership in the field. The country aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development. While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier moon landing, it faces significant technical hurdles, such as the need for in-orbit refueling. This intensifying space race has prompted the U.S. to increase funding for its own lunar exploration efforts.</p>
