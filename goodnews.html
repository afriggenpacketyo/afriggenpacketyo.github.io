          <p>Applied Digital shares surged 16% on Friday, extending an impressive 344% year-to-date gain, following robust first-quarter revenue driven by high demand for artificial intelligence data centers. The company reported $64.2 million in revenue, an 84% increase from the previous year, and a narrower loss per share than anticipated by analysts. This strong performance is fueled by a substantial $7 billion lease agreement with CoreWeave for its Polaris Forge 1 campus and securing funding for a second North Dakota campus, totaling 600 MW capacity. CEO Wes Cummins emphasized the company's strategic position to serve the intelligence era, with hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year.

He emphasizes his unwavering dedication to Scotland, asserting that his focus and connection with players will remain unchanged.

This new facility will enable Qatari F-15 pilots to train with American military personnel, aiming to enhance combined training, lethality, and interoperability. The initiative underscores the Trump administration's strengthening ties with Qatar, which has also included an executive order to assure Qatar's security and the acceptance of a Boeing 747 jet. However, this growing relationship has faced criticism, especially concerning potential conflicts of interest linked to Trump's family business expansion in the Middle East.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Optimal Timing and Alternatives for Opening a Gold IRA</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 16:10:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that the decision to open a gold IRA should primarily be driven by a desire for portfolio diversification, particularly in the current economic climate with expectations of continued record highs. While gold IRAs can offer inflation protection and wealth preservation, they are not suitable for novice investors or those needing short-term access to funds due to required asset levels for effective diversification. Alternatives to a gold IRA include investing in physical gold, gold ETFs, gold mining stocks, and gold futures and options, each with varying levels of risk and liquidity. Investors should consider a long-term perspective and carefully vet reputable providers when exploring gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rocket Lab shares surged 14% this week, extending a nearly 40% gain over two weeks, driven by a flurry of new launch deals in the burgeoning space tech industry. The company secured two launches with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for December and 2026, in addition to a multi-launch agreement with Q-shu Pioneers of Space. These recent successes build on 10 additional missions secured last month for Synspective, bringing their total to 21. The stock's impressive 150% year-to-date climb also reflects increased investor interest in the space sector, fueled by government contracts and a wave of recent public offerings from other space ventures.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested an unproven link between autism and circumcision, further reiterating his theory that Tylenol causes the disorder, claims that medical experts are strongly refuting. Kennedy cited two studies from 2013 and 2015, but experts like Dr. Céline Gounder highlight issues of correlation versus causation and confounding variables in these studies. Pediatricians, including Dr. Steven Abelowitz, firmly state there is no causal relationship between Tylenol, circumcisions, or vaccines and autism, noting Tylenol is rarely used after early circumcisions. International organizations, like the UK's National Autistic Society, have also condemned Kennedy's "dangerous anti-science" statements.</p>

          <p>Financial experts recommend gold as a suitable investment for millennials, offering crucial portfolio diversification, especially given its uncorrelated nature to other assets like stocks. Gold has demonstrated its ability to safeguard wealth during economic downturns, inflation, and market crashes, with prices soaring and surpassing $4,000 per ounce in October. Investing in gold at a younger age allows for more time to benefit from its long-term appreciation and proven stability, unlike trendier, more volatile assets. Various investment methods exist, including physical gold, ETFs, mutual funds, and gold IRAs, though experts advise limiting gold's portfolio share to a maximum of 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts affirm gold's enduring relevance and strategic importance in contemporary investment portfolios, citing its historical role as a safe haven, inflation hedge, and effective risk diversifier.

Brett Elliott of APMEX highlights that physical gold possesses "zero counterparty risk," distinguishing it from many other assets, including government treasuries. Investors can choose from various forms, such as physical coins and bars, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), gold IRAs, gold mining stocks, or gold futures, each offering distinct advantages for portfolio enhancement.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut and anticipated further reductions, financial experts are advising on optimal gold investments to consider. Physical gold and gold ETFs that hold physical gold are highlighted as the safest options, offering crucial portfolio diversification and maintaining value amidst economic uncertainty, particularly with a presidential election and potential recession on the horizon. Additionally, yield-earning gold investments, such as precious metals leases and gold bonds, are becoming increasingly attractive as interest rates decline. These strategies provide investors with tangible ways to safeguard wealth and potentially generate returns in a shifting economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increasing investor interest in physical gold due to inflation and economic uncertainty, understanding safe storage practices is crucial. Experts emphasize that physical gold carries unique risks like theft, damage, and natural disasters, unlike digital assets. Ben Nadelstein notes the importance of physical integrity for gold's value, while Brett Elliott highlights "contractual risk" with third-party facilities. Best practices include storing gold off-site at secure, independent depositories that are fully allocated, insured, and third-party audited, such as the Texas Bullion Depository. Investors should also be aware of storage costs, typically 0.33% to 0.5% of the gold's value annually, and understand liquidation terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkey's intelligence chief, Ibrahim Kalin, recently joined the US-backed Gaza peace talks in Egypt, signaling Turkey's significant, albeit late, involvement in the negotiation process. President Trump had reportedly urged Turkish President Erdogan to leverage his nation's close ties with Hamas to secure the group's acceptance of the deal. The agreement outlines an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial Israeli troop withdrawal, with Turkey expected to join a task force alongside US, Egyptian, and Qatari units for implementation. Turkey's potential deployment of troops to Gaza, requiring parliamentary approval, underscores its growing geopolitical role and commitment to the peace initiative, despite lingering uncertainties about Israeli reservations.</p>
