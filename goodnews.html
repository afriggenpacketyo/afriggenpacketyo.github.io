          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case *Ames v. Ohio*, which was directly relevant to the question of how much a nation and its institutions should provide assistance to targeted groups to help increase diversity in employment and education and help targeted groups overcome the systemic effects of centuries of discrimination. Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 after she believed she'd been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation, after she was demoted and replaced with a gay man after applying for a management position. The court's unanimity, and the identity of the author of the court's opinion, was notable, with the opinion itself being simple.</p>

          <p>Jobe Bellingham is following a similar path to his brother Jude by joining Dortmund, but he is determined to establish his own identity in football. While Jude plays as a number 10, Jobe is versatile, playing as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder. During his first season at Sunderland, he played 43 times, scoring four goals and registering three assists. His move to Germany is seen as a positive step, offering less pressure and financial advantages, and while comparisons to his brother are inevitable, Jobe aims to prove himself as a talented footballer in his own right.</p>

          <p>According to a YouGov poll of 1,000 American adults, and based on the author's research, the most common reasons couples fight include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or attitude can signal contempt, a predictor of divorce. Family arguments often reflect unmet needs, while chore disputes stem from uneven labor distribution. Ineffective communication can derail conversations, but couples can improve by naming the load, reassuring one another, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out.</p>

An online safety campaigner criticized the government for delaying new laws to protect children. Curfews and screen time limits are already available through parental controls on Apple and Google devices, and TikTok has introduced a 60-minute default limit for users under 18.</p>
