          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for certain 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a role the agency had taken over following safety crises. This decision signals growing regulatory confidence in the manufacturer's production quality after years of intense scrutiny and restrictions, including a production cap on the 737 MAX. The FAA stated its inspectors will now focus on other areas of the production process, while continuing to oversee certification on an alternating basis with Boeing.</p>

          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. This approach suggests converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, aiming to balance financial security with liquidity. The article notes that this strategy may not be suitable for everyone and depends on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has excluded the pro-Russia party Heart of Moldova from participating in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities for one year amid an investigation into illegal financing and vote-buying, which officials allege is part of a broader Russian effort to influence the election. This move is a critical development for the former Soviet republic, which is a candidate for European Union membership and is governed by a pro-European party.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is initiating a position in Nike, expressing confidence in the long-term turnaround plan under CEO Elliott Hill. The apparel company has struggled since 2021 due to issues in China, a flawed direct-to-consumer strategy that alienated retail partners, and rising competition. Hill's "Win Now" strategy focuses on core products and markets, repairing retail relationships, and cleaning up excess inventory to improve margins. The purchase is framed as a long-term investment rather than a bet on the upcoming quarterly earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new "Gold Card" program, which offers U.S. residency for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the government, is reportedly drawing significant interest from the global wealthy. Immigration attorneys say the price, reduced from an initial proposal of $5 million, makes it highly competitive with similar "golden visa" programs in other countries. The program aims to raise federal revenue and is expected to attract thousands of applicants, particularly from China and India, though legal challenges and existing backlogs for those countries may complicate its rollout.</p>

Clegg also warned against the trend of "data localization," where countries demand citizen data be stored domestically, as a threat to the open internet.</p>

The book's protagonist, an avatar for Lockwood herself, contracts the virus and suffers from persistent fever and cognitive difficulties, leading her to question if she has become a different person. The article highlights how the illness, while unwelcome, acts as a catalyst for metamorphosis, a theme of personal change that has been a long-standing interest in Lockwood's work, including her writing on Virginia Woolf.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure, avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and review the app's code for security. Under the deal, TikTok's parent company, China-based ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, satisfying the requirements of a divest-or-ban law passed by Congress.</p>
