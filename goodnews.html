          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fishlake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. Investigators used the manufacturing date of the boot to link it to the cold case. White had disappeared after going fishing alone, with his boat later found empty. DNA testing confirmed the remains were a parental match to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty. The family expressed gratitude for the closure after nearly three decades of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs, a subspecies extinct in the wild for decades, have made their public debut at a zoo in the Czech Republic. The birth is part of an international endangered species program aiming to eventually reintroduce the lions to their native habitat in North Africa's Atlas Mountains. The last wild Barbary lion was believed to have been killed in the 1960s, with fewer than 200 now living in captivity. While officials say reintroduction is a distant goal, they are in talks with Moroccan authorities to explore the possibility.</p>

          <p>Following a destructive fire that ravaged the community of Altadena, resident Laurie Scott has started a free plant stand called "Regrow Altadena" to help her neighbors recover. After losing her own garage, Scott found solace in a small houseplant and was inspired to share that feeling of hope and renewal. She propagates plants and gives them away from a stand in her yard, having distributed over 1,000 plants and seed packets so far. The initiative has grown with community support, offering everything from houseplants to native California saplings to help restore the area's lost greenery.</p>

The 2014 World Cup winner, known for his unique "Raumdeuter" or "space interpreter" playing style, is expected to bring immense experience and leadership to the Canadian club. While some question how a player nearing 36 will adapt to the league, many pundits believe his intelligence and personality will be a major asset. The signing is a significant coup for the Whitecaps and a major boost for the league's profile.</p>

          <p>Nashville-based band Rainbow Kitten Surprise will release a new album, "Bones," on September 26. The 10-track collection is a raw and direct follow-up to their sprawling 2024 album, with frontwoman Ela Melo stating the songs "just came pouring out." Produced by Jay Joyce, the record features a more stripped-down rock sound, with many songs written on guitar to be easily playable live. Lyrically, the album is described as a "spill-your-guts-out record," with Melo ad-libbing verses in the studio that touch on relationships, sobriety, and past experiences.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join President Trump to announce a new $100 billion investment commitment in the United States. This pledge, which includes a new "American Manufacturing Program," brings Apple's total planned investment in the U.S. over the next four years to $600 billion. The announcement comes as the Trump administration continues to pressure the tech giant to move more of its production from China and other countries to America. This move may help Apple navigate the administration's tariff policies, which have recently been expanded to include higher rates on Indian goods.</p>

          <p>Shares of e-commerce platform Shopify surged 20% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and provided a strong forecast for the third quarter. The company's revenue grew 31% year-over-year, and it expects continued growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage rate. Shopify's CFO stated that the potential negative impact from US tariffs, which had been factored into previous guidance, "did not materialize." The positive results suggest robust consumer spending and that Shopify's merchants are successfully navigating the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the roles of annuities and certificates of deposit (CDs) in retirement planning, noting that neither is universally superior. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC-insured safety, making them suitable for short-term goals and capital preservation. However, their returns often fail to outpace inflation. Annuities are designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, but are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, risk tolerance, and desire for lifetime income versus flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
