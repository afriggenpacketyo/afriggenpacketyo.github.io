        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in collegiate sports. The settlement includes provisions for schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion to compensate former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will vary based on the sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving up to $135,000 each, while the highest payouts could reach nearly $2 million for lost NIL opportunities. This decision resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, addressing claims that these rules denied athletes the opportunity to earn money from their names, images, and likenesses.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China.

Lee's administration is anticipated to focus on domestic economic recovery and engagement with North Korea. However, continuity is expected in military cooperation with the US and Japan, despite potential adjustments in broader foreign policy strategies.</p>

          <p>While tech billionaires pursue extreme methods for extended lifespans, the average person's life expectancy is stagnating or declining in many high-income countries. A focus on individual self-optimization distracts from the significant impact of public policy, infrastructure, and community on health and longevity. Countries like Japan and South Korea, where healthy lifestyles are integrated into government and culture, demonstrate the importance of collective responsibility. Achieving better health outcomes requires policies that prioritize nutritious food, active cities, clean air, and preventive healthcare for everyone.</p>

Matthew, the man's son, initiated a search into his family history during the pandemic, leading to a DNA test that revealed unexpected relatives. The discovery highlights the era before standardized identification practices in hospitals, when babies were often cared for in nurseries and identified only by cards on their cots. The BBC reports there are now five known cases of babies mistakenly switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s.</p>
