          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project," a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, aims to provide a faster alternative to existing connections via the US. The project is expected to benefit other South American countries like Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Google is investing between $300 million and $550 million, while the Chilean government will contribute $25 million to the initiative which will also reduce signal latency, improving telemedicine capabilities.</p>

          <p>A plow driver testified that he saw no body in the snow during multiple passes by the address where Karen Read is accused of leaving her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, to die. Brian "Lucky" Loughran stated he didn't see a body on the lawn while clearing snow in the hours after prosecutors allege O'Keefe stopped moving. Loughran's testimony supports the defense's argument that O'Keefe was not present at the location during the time frame suggested by the prosecution. The defense also presented testimony from a friend of both O'Keefe and Read, who stated that Read did not seem too drunk to drive the night of O'Keefe's death, further challenging the prosecution's narrative.</p>

          <p>A leading battery scientist, Zhou Jianbin, with extensive experience in the US, has returned to a Chinese university to advance his work on next-generation battery technologies. Zhou earned his PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and worked as a researcher in the US before returning to China as a special professor at USTC. His research focuses on the design and development of electrode materials and electrolytes for high-performance solid-state metal batteries. This move indicates a potential shift in the global race for solid-state battery innovation and talent, with China increasingly attracting top researchers in the field.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The fact that this referendum is happening is considered a miracle, as the Italian state has been tightening citizenship rules for the past three decades. Prime Minister Meloni has declared she will not be collecting her ballot, and several high-profile ministers are encouraging people to skip the vote. The outcome of the referendum could recognize the dignity and diversity of millions of residents, enriching Italy's national story with new protagonists.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. This operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels, making it the agency's largest operation of its kind. The agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels, with hundreds more still needing to be addressed.</p>
