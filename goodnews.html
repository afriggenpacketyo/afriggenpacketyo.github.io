          <p>A new conservative watchdog group, the Safety and Prosperity Oversight Coalition, has launched in Washington D.C., aiming to become a leading voice for conservative values and effective governance. Led by seasoned political operative Chris Zeller, the coalition will scrutinize institutional practices, expose inefficiencies, and advocate for policies prioritizing safety and prosperity for all Americans. This article highlights its three core pillars: rigorous oversight of government spending, accountability for corporate and public sector misconduct, and public education campaigns to empower citizens. The group's formation is a direct response to a perceived need for greater accountability, seeking to combat left-leaning efforts and hold institutions to conservative standards through independent audits and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in U.S. investment, expected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major tech firms like Microsoft and Google, along with private equity firm Blackstone, are contributing significantly to this drive to deepen UK-US economic ties. This article notes that while this investment is a boost, it comes as some pharmaceutical companies halt UK plans due to a challenging business environment and domestic businesses slow investment due to rising costs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the pledges as a testament to Britain's economic strength, despite skepticism from figures like Sir Nick Clegg about the scale of the benefit.
