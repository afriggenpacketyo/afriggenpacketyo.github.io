          <p>President Xi Jinping commemorated the 120th birth anniversary of Chen Yun, a key economic planner of the Communist Party of China, signaling a shift towards prioritizing resilient governance. Xi's speech focused on development planning and political resilience, with less emphasis on communist conviction compared to his 2015 address. He portrayed Chen as a model of disciplined governance, highlighting his ability to balance state-led and market approaches to economic planning. Xi also promoted Chen's maxim of following facts and embracing policy logic in uncertain times, suggesting a pragmatic approach to navigating current challenges. This rhetorical shift indicates a move towards technocratic governance amidst multiple crises.</p>

          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK. The deal represents a significant private capital investment in a project of national interest for the UK, with the interest rate below 7%. The unsecured lending to EDF, the majority owner of Hinkley Point C, is believed to be earmarked for the project, which has faced delays and budget increases. This investment comes after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted its funding amid tensions with the British government, leaving EDF to cover the project's costs alone, and the first reactor is expected to come online in 2029.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark had a difficult shooting night as the Indiana Fever fell to the Golden State Valkyries, despite a recent win against the Connecticut Sun.

The Fever lost the game 88-77 after blowing a 13-point lead, with turnovers being a significant factor. This performance comes after a physical game against the Sun, where Clark was poked in the eye and shoved to the ground, but the team's next opportunity to rebound will be against the Las Vegas Aces.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have discovered that individuals with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, exhibit significant differences in their blood compared to healthy individuals. This finding could lead to the development of a diagnostic test for the condition, which has long been dismissed as psychological. The study, which compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals, identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. Researchers hope this evidence will help validate the experiences of individuals who have been disbelieved regarding their symptoms.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, Caregiving, examines the difficulties of family caregiving in America, highlighting the lack of resources and support. The film traces the history of caregiving in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the limitations of Medicare and Medicaid. Caregivers often face significant out-of-pocket expenses and lost income, and the film explores the policy decisions that have led to caregiving being largely a private matter rather than a public concern. Activists are now pushing for new policies to support caregivers, with some bipartisan efforts gaining traction.</p>
