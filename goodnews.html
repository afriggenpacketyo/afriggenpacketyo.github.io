        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a high-interest-rate environment, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are presented as more affordable borrowing options for homeowners compared to personal loans or credit cards. With the average homeowner possessing significant equity, these financial products offer lower rates that are expected to decrease further with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article details the current average rates for different loan terms and explains the functional differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate HELOC. It also notes potential tax benefits but warns that the home is used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, current interest rates remain a significant factor amid a challenging market. This article provides the average national rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances as of late September 2025. It suggests that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure a better rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms.

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should, at a minimum, secure a trademark to legally protect their brand. This measure is compared to owning a deed to a house, preventing others from using a similar name, logo, or slogan and potentially suing for a share of the profits. The article stresses the importance of thinking about the future growth of a business, no matter how small it starts. Other recommended legal protections include obtaining copyrights for original work and forming a limited liability company (LLC) to separate personal and business assets, thereby protecting personal finances from potential lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular investment, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The article reports the price of gold as of September 25, 2025, while noting that its value is subject to constant fluctuation. Several key factors that influence gold's price are detailed, including supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The strength of the U.S. dollar and the policies of central banks also play a significant role in determining the value of the precious metal in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August. The headline inflation rate saw a slight increase to 2.7%, with both figures aligning with economists' expectations. The data suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices, and strong consumer spending and income growth were also reported. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's course, with policymakers still anticipating further interest rate reductions before the end of the year.

          <p>A Chinese tech start-up has successfully launched the world's most powerful flying wind turbine in the Xinjiang region. The airship-like device, named S1500, is the size of a basketball court and generated one megawatt of power during its test flight. Unlike traditional ground-based turbines, this airborne model floats on helium and is tethered to the ground by cables that transmit electricity. The company's CEO stated that this test was a critical step toward real-world application, with mass production scheduled for 2026 and grid connection expected the same year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, is advancing in Congress with the goal of making Social Security's claiming-age terminology easier to understand. The proposed changes would rename the "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and the "full retirement age" (66-67) to "standard benefit age." Additionally, age 70 would be referred to as the "maximum benefit age." Proponents argue these new terms more accurately reflect the financial consequences of claiming benefits at different times, which could help retirees make more informed decisions and improve their long-term financial security.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan Senate bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, aims to address the national housing crisis by encouraging changes at the local level through federal action. The legislation proposes developing model zoning codes to promote denser construction and creating financial incentives for municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. While state-level efforts have had some success in overriding restrictive local zoning, they often face significant political opposition. This federal approach seeks to cut through local gridlock by offering grants and support, potentially creating a framework for "Right-to-Build Zones" where streamlined regulations could spur much-needed development.</p>

          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, has been dismissed due to a procedural error. He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. A judge at Woolwich Crown Court ruled the charge "unlawful" because it was not brought within the required six-month time limit, as the prosecution failed to obtain the necessary consent in time. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has suspended newly announced export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa. The curbs, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different chip-related products, were introduced amid a diplomatic dispute over South Africa's demand that Taipei change the name of its representative office. Following the announcement of the controls, South Africa agreed to suspend its demand and engage in further discussions. This led Taiwan to backtrack on the planned measures, which were seen as a rare unilateral move by Taipei to use its dominance in the chip industry for diplomatic leverage.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on her marriage to a man who is her political opposite—a devoted supporter of Donald Trump. Despite their conflicting views, which once led a marriage counselor to advise them to avoid politics entirely, their 15-year relationship endures. The author describes the tension that arises from their differences but ultimately focuses on the qualities that hold them together, such as mutual laughter, support, and acts of kindness. The piece illustrates how love and personal connection can coexist with, and sometimes transcend, the profound political and cultural divisions prevalent in contemporary American society.</p>

          <p>Hiring a financial advisor involves understanding how they are compensated, which typically falls into commission-based or fee-based models. Commissions are one-time payments for selling a product, which can create conflicts of interest, while fee-based structures include charges based on assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or hourly rates. The most common model is the AUM fee, where an advisor charges a percentage of the client's portfolio. The article explains the pros and cons of each model and advises consumers to ask direct questions about fees and potential conflicts to protect their investments and ensure transparency.</p>

          <h2>Ultra-Wealthy Investors Favor Public Stocks for AI Exposure, Survey Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 family offices reveals that the ultra-wealthy prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities rather than direct investments in startups or venture capital funds. Over half of the respondents reported AI exposure via stocks or ETFs, compared to just a quarter investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies among top stocks in the S&P 500. The trend indicates that while high-profile tech billionaires make headlines backing startups, the broader cohort of wealthy investors is taking a more conventional approach.
