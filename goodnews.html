          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior talent, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing and compensation. This move does not involve an investment in Windsurf but grants Google a nonexclusive license to its technology, allowing the startup to remain independent. The acquisition highlights the escalating "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, as major companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft compete fiercely for top-tier expertise.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a significant backlash over its recent collection. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their cultural origins, sparking a social media outcry. In response, the company engaged with an Indian commerce chamber representing the artisans to explore respectful collaboration, a move seen as a positive step in addressing cultural appropriation in fashion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops in several Southern California counties based solely on factors like race or language. The ruling responds to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were engaging in unconstitutional racial profiling and other violations. The judge noted there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims, marking a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on controversial immigration enforcement methods.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against the AI startup Lovo can proceed, representing a notable development in the legal battles over AI training data. While the judge dismissed claims that a person's voice can be copyrighted, the artists' claims for breach of contract and deceptive business practices will move forward. The case centers on allegations that the artists' voices were cloned and sold on Lovo's platform after they were told the recordings were for internal use only.</p>

          <p>In response to a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies expanding overseas, Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their global presence. The number of their foreign offices has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as Chinese businesses often prefer legal support from their compatriots. While they are successfully serving this niche, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid a climate of rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry.</p>

          <p>Dozens of weight-loss drugs are currently in development in China, as pharmaceutical companies race to create rivals to highly successful GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, which is expected to open the floodgates for cheaper generic versions. Analysts predict this will dramatically lower prices and expand access to these treatments for a massive potential market of patients with obesity and diabetes. (not investment advice)</p>
