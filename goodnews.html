          <p>Inflation in the euro zone rose to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in months. This development was largely expected by economists and follows varied inflation data from major economies like Germany, France, and Spain. The closely watched services inflation metric also increased slightly. Following the data release, the ECB's chief economist indicated that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now considered complete, suggesting the bank will likely hold interest rates steady in its upcoming July meeting before a potential final cut in September.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in July, approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills decrease by about 7% under the new Ofgem price cap. This translates to a reduction of around ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, concerns persist that bills will remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels, and future price direction is uncertain, especially heading into winter. Analysts forecast a potential minor drop in October, but Ofgem is also planning long-term infrastructure investments that could add to bills in the coming decade, urging consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for stability.

          <p>Former U.S. Representative Colin Allred, a Democrat, has officially launched his campaign for the Texas Senate seat in 2026, setting up a potentially high-profile race. Allred, a former NFL player, previously ran an unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz in 2024. His entry comes as the Republican primary for the seat heats up, with Attorney General Ken Paxton challenging incumbent Senator John Cornyn. Democrats view the race as a key target, hoping to capitalize on GOP infighting and shifting suburban demographics, though the party has not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, presenting a significant challenge.</p>

Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, discussed his goals of implementing free public transit and expanded childcare, which he believes are feasible despite needing state-level cooperation. He responded to backlash over his identity and unsubstantiated claims against him, attributing them to a multi-million dollar smear campaign. Mamdani also clarified his controversial remarks about billionaires, stating his focus is on addressing income inequality to ensure working people can afford to live in the city, not on eliminating wealth.</p>

          <p>State and national lawmakers are addressing a significant gap in medical training regarding menopause, as many doctors receive little to no formal education on the topic. In California, a bill is advancing that would require menopause-related coursework for physicians to renew their licenses. This legislative push is part of a national trend, with 13 states introducing similar bills this session to improve provider knowledge and patient care for symptoms that affect half the population. Advocates and medical professionals highlight that many people suffer from manageable symptoms due to unresponsive or ill-equipped doctors, emphasizing the need for better, more consistent medical education and care.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission reveals a shift in how Americans voted in the 2024 election. While mail-in voting decreased to 30.3% of turnout from its pandemic peak of 43% in 2020, it remains more popular than in pre-pandemic elections. Conversely, in-person voting saw a resurgence, with early in-person voting becoming a particularly popular option. For the first time, all states offered some form of in-person voting before Election Day. The data suggests that while misinformation campaigns may have impacted mail-in voting's popularity, voters are embracing the convenience of casting their ballots in person ahead of the final day, prompting election officials to prepare for diverse voting preferences.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Huawei has made two of its Pangu series artificial intelligence models open-source, a strategic move aimed at accelerating AI adoption and expanding its ecosystem globally. This decision allows developers and businesses to freely use and customize the models, which is expected to incentivize the use of Huawei's broader AI products, particularly its Ascend AI chips. Experts note that by coupling its software with its own hardware, Huawei is creating a unique advantage and solidifying its position across the entire AI value chain. The strategy is also seen as a way to make inroads into new overseas markets, especially in developing countries, amid ongoing U.S. export restrictions.</p>

This capital infusion intensifies the competition with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, as xAI plans to build one of the world's largest data centers.

          <p>At a technology conference in Bangkok, experts emphasized the importance of emerging economies developing "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and address unique cultural and linguistic needs. Panelists argued that many prominent AI models are English-centric, failing to capture the nuances of other languages and cultures. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for democratizing AI and allowing nations to build their own systems. The ASEAN region, with its large, young, and digitally savvy population, is seen as particularly well-positioned to lead this charge, fostering a collective energy to compete globally and ensure the benefits of AI are not concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

          <p>According to a source, China has offered a tax refund to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy, Martell, and R√©my Martin, as part of ongoing negotiations. The offer comes ahead of a July 5 deadline in Beijing's anti-dumping investigation into European brandy, which could result in permanent tariffs of up to 39%. To qualify for the refund, producers must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices. France's main cognac industry body confirmed that a preliminary agreement on a minimum import price has been negotiated, pending approval from Chinese authorities, in an effort to resolve the trade dispute.</p>

The review comes after a parliamentary committee labeled the UK's system one of the worst in the developed world. Campaign groups have welcomed the 18-month review, noting that low pay for paternity leave and extremely low take-up of shared leave highlight the need for significant reform to better support working families.</p>

          <p>In a profile piece, new British and Irish Lions captain Maro Itoje opens up about the wide range of interests and beliefs that shape his life and leadership style. The 30-year-old rugby star discusses his Christian faith, which he says has deepened in recent years and provides him with humility and perspective. Beyond the pitch, Itoje is involved in politics, charity through his Pearl Fund, and the art world, having founded the Akoje Gallery to promote African art. As he prepares to lead the Lions on their tour of Australia, Itoje aims to maintain his calm and routine, balancing the immense pressure of captaincy with his multi-faceted "portfolio existence."</p>
