          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff secured her place in the last 16 of the US Open with a commanding 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. After two tense opening matches and recent changes to her coaching team aimed at fixing her serve, Gauff delivered a much more settled and confident performance. She minimized double faults and dominated rallies, showing signs that the adjustments to her game are beginning to pay off. This win marks her fourth consecutive year reaching the second week of her home Grand Slam, reinforcing her status as a top contender.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has submitted an improved £35 million bid for Crystal Palace's captain and defender, Marc Guehi, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, seeking an additional £5 million in performance-related bonuses, and talks between the two clubs are ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, prompting Palace to negotiate a sale rather than risk losing him on a free transfer next summer. The London club is actively seeking two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's potential move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with the condiment company Hela to create a limited-edition beer infused with spiced curry ketchup. The new beverage, named "Currydurst" (Currythirst), pays homage to the city's iconic street food, Currywurst, which is traditionally served with curry ketchup and often enjoyed with an Astra beer. This unconventional brew combines the classic taste of the local beer with the spicy, smoky notes of Hela's famous sauce. The brewery is producing only 2,000 liters of this special edition, testing the public's appetite for a novel flavor combination.</p>

          <p>An original lightsaber prop used by Darth Vader in the "Star Wars" films is headlining a major Hollywood memorabilia auction with a presale estimate of $3 million. The auction, hosted by Propstore, will feature over 1,000 items, including the cursed medallion from "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Indiana Jones's bullwhip. The lightsaber's authenticity was verified by tracing its construction from a real vintage camera flash attachment, a method used by the original prop makers. While some items command high prices, the event also offers lower-ticket props, allowing fans a chance to own a piece of film history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy of expanding expedited removals, which allows for the rapid deportation of undocumented immigrants without a court hearing. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that applying this process to migrants detained in the interior of the country, who may have been present for up to two years, is unlawful. The ruling is a significant, though potentially temporary, setback for the administration's aggressive deportation agenda. Judge Cobb's opinion emphasized that the government's argument could threaten the due process rights of citizens and noncitizens alike.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the recent Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been reported in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. Mayor Eric Adams stated the city will implement new measures to improve detection and response, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence could significantly speed up the diagnosis of serious heart conditions, according to UK researchers. The device analyzes a patient's heartbeat and blood flow for subtle sounds the human ear cannot detect, identifying signs of heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. In a large study involving over 200 GP surgeries, patients examined with the AI stethoscope were diagnosed with heart conditions far more frequently than those in a control group. Experts believe this innovation could be a game-changer, enabling earlier treatment and improving patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic 'The Toxic Avenger,' directed by Macon Blair, stars Peter Dinklage as the titular mutant hero. This updated version retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the Troma original but presents it with a higher production value and a well-known cast including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story centers on Winston Goose, a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, becomes a disfigured vigilante fighting a villainous pharmaceutical corporation. The film balances its gruesome, goofy humor with a surprising amount of emotional sincerity and a clear environmental message.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on nearly all trading partners represent an illegal overreach of presidential emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used for justification, does not grant the authority to impose such broad taxes. While the tariffs have not been immediately halted, they are set to expire in mid-October unless the administration successfully appeals to the Supreme Court. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic and trade policy.</p>

          <p>Receding water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir in northern Iraq, caused by severe drought, have led to the discovery of approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists believe the tombs date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic period. The excavation was only possible because the ongoing drought has lowered the reservoir to historically low levels. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for archaeological work. The team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again.</p>
