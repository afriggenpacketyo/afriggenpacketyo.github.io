The 15,000-square-mile Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve is crucial for research at the McDonald Observatory and supports local tourism and wildlife. Astronomers and conservationists have successfully worked with local governments and even oil and gas companies to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting ordinances.

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone rose to 2% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's target for the first time in an extended period. The slight increase from May's 1.9% rate was driven in part by a pickup in services inflation, which reached 3.3%. This development has reinforced expectations that the ECB will hold interest rates steady in its upcoming July meeting before potentially implementing a final cut in September. Following the data release, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane stated that the central bank's cycle of interventions to curb high inflation is now considered complete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy bills for millions of households across England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by 7% as of July 1st, providing some relief to consumers. Under the new price cap from regulator Ofgem, a typical household's annual bill will fall by approximately ¬£129. However, analysts caution that prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and future costs, especially for the upcoming winter, are uncertain. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a minor 1% drop in October, highlighting the continued volatility of the international gas market and the need for long-term energy infrastructure investment.

          <p>This article explores the complicated but profound relationship between iconic writer Hunter S. Thompson and his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Key locations like Churchill Downs were pivotal, as his 1970 article on the Kentucky Derby gave birth to the revolutionary style of "Gonzo journalism." The Louisville Free Public Library and the nearby Cherokee Park were also crucial influences on his youth, fostering a love for reading while also being the site of a fateful robbery that led to his enlistment in the Air Force. Despite his global fame, Thompson's early experiences and connections in Louisville fundamentally shaped his life and literary career.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Representative Colin Allred has officially launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas for the 2026 election. A former NFL player, Allred is entering a race that is already drawing national attention, particularly due to the contentious Republican primary between incumbent Senator John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton. Democrats view the seat as a key target for expanding their Senate map, though they have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994. Allred's campaign video focuses on lowering costs and criticizes both potential Republican opponents for rigging the economy against working Texans.</p>

Mamdani secured a strong lead with 43.5% of first-choice votes on election night, and his victory is anticipated once second and third-choice preferences are tabulated. The process involves eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes in successive rounds and reallocating their votes until one candidate surpasses 50%. Given Mamdani's substantial lead and a cross-endorsement with another top candidate, his path to clinching the nomination appears secure.</p>

Conversely, in-person early voting has become increasingly popular, with a majority of votes now cast in person before or on Election Day.

By making its models and technology freely available, Huawei aims to encourage developers and businesses to build applications around its Ascend AI chips, which are China's primary competitors to Nvidia's products. This strategy allows Huawei to strengthen its position across the entire AI value chain, from hardware to software, while navigating U.S. export restrictions.

This offer comes as Beijing's investigation into European brandy, which is set to conclude on July 5, continues. To qualify for the refund, producers must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to avoiding dumping practices. The move is seen as an attempt to de-escalate trade tensions between China and the European Union. If no agreement is reached, temporary tariffs of up to 39 percent could become permanent.</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed an optimized model using satellite data to accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from individual coal-fired power plants. This new framework offers a standardized and high-precision methodology for global carbon accounting, an area that has historically lacked consistency. The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, demonstrates the significant potential of remote sensing technology for tracking emissions. The researchers suggest this satellite-based approach could also be adapted to monitor other major emission sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants.</p>
