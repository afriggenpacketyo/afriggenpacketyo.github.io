Fleetwood held a two-shot lead with three holes remaining but bogeyed the last after missing a crucial par putt. Bradley's clutch performance sealed the victory, leaving Fleetwood "gutted" after a disappointing finish. This marks Bradley's first win since his Ryder Cup captaincy announcement, adding another accolade to his career.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, witnessed the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Despite initial fears for the monkeys' survival, most of the population of 1,800 monkeys survived the storm, a mystery that researchers attribute to possible sheltering behavior and changes in diet. The team also managed to preserve decades of research data and biological samples through dedicated efforts to maintain power to freezers. The experience highlighted the resilience of both the monkeys and the research team in the face of extreme environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>60 Minutes explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammals, with zoologist Lucy Cooke in Costa Rica. Cooke explains that sloths' slow movement is an energy-saving adaptation to their vegetarian diet of toxic leaves, allowing them to survive for over 64 million years. Despite their poor eyesight and hearing, sloths are masters of disguise in the trees and conserve energy by moving deliberately, and are uniquely built to survive. Cooke also discusses her book "Bitch," challenging conventional wisdom about gender roles in the animal kingdom, while highlighting efforts to protect sloths from human-caused dangers like power lines.</p>

          <p>Scientists studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, or Monkey Island, have gained rare access to over six decades of biological and behavioral data. The monkeys, descendants of a group brought from India in 1938, live in a natural laboratory setting where researchers study their social interactions and adaptability. Hurricane Maria in 2017 devastated the island, but most of the monkeys survived, leading to new research into their resilience and the impact of environmental stress on their health. The study revealed that monkeys who lived through the hurricane had immune systems that aged prematurely, suggesting the trauma of the event accelerated their biological aging.</p>

          <p>To prevent Social Security overpayments, recipients should regularly check their earnings history and verify payment amounts. If returning to work while receiving disability benefits, recipients must carefully monitor their income to stay below the Substantial Gainful Activity limit.

Promptly report any mistakes to the Social Security Administration and maintain detailed records of all communications, as this can be grounds for challenging overpayments or underpayments.

          <h2>US Urges China to Prevent Iran from Closing Strait of Hormuz</h2>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. China is Iran's largest oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic. Rubio warned that closing the strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt its oil exports to China. The U.S. retains options to address any Iranian attempt to close the strait, and the U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf.</p>
