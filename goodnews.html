          <p>Market analyst Gary Shilling suggests that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China may create investment opportunities in India. Shilling highlights India's democratic government, British-inherited legal system, and widespread use of the English language as factors making it an attractive investment destination. He also points out India's booming population, which is expected to grow while China's declines, and the increasing proportion of money spent on services as economies grow, with India poised to capitalize on recreation, travel, and medical services.

          <p>After eight years of weekly dialogues, New York Times columnists Gail Collins (liberal) and Bret Stephens (conservative) are ending their written "Conversation." In a final audio episode, they discuss the transformation of the Republican Party, the degradation of public discourse, and how they maintained civil conversations despite political differences. They emphasize the importance of humor, listening, and not aiming to "win" arguments, and address reader questions about their process and whether they ever changed their positions; Stephens admits Collins swayed him on gun control, and the columnists stress the importance of remembering that the goal of a conversation is to keep the ball in the air rather than to score points.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a dip as investors reacted to Warren Buffett's unexpected announcement to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel set to replace him on January 1, 2026. Despite the share decline, analysts believe that Buffett's continued role as chairman will ensure a smooth transition and maintain the company's stability. Buffett's decision marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under his leadership, and he is handing over the reins at a high point as the company's shares recently reached a new peak.</p>

The decision to increase production, nearly triple the forecast, has raised concerns about a potential oversupply in the market.
