          <p>The UK plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of a major defense review aimed at enhancing warfighting readiness. The review also includes a ¬£15 billion investment in the UK's nuclear warhead program and a commitment to build six new munitions factories. Additional measures involve developing up to 7,000 long-range weapons, establishing a cyber and electromagnetic command, and allocating funds for military housing repairs. The construction of new submarines is expected to support 30,000 jobs, apprenticeships, and graduate roles, strengthening the UK's defense posture and contributing to NATO's security. The move shows a commitment to military defense and readiness. </p>

          <p>New US-China tariff wars are affecting the Chinese technology sector by making it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market.

These companies are also aggressively seeking opportunities in other markets such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepening trade relations with Europe by offering technology transfers for market access. Despite the challenges, Chinese firms are determined to remain competitive. The situation presents both challenges and opportunities. </p>
