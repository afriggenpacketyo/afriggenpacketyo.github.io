          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion. While acknowledging the financial benefits and prestige of the tournament, Guardiola admitted he tries not to think about the potential for player exhaustion and burnout to avoid anxiety.

          <p>The search for the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings from amateur seekers. This folklore-like quest is paralleled by a serious scientific endeavor, as a well-funded de-extinction project aims to bring the creature back to life using genetic engineering. Researchers are working to edit the DNA of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, in a project that highlights both a passion for the lost species and a sense of remorse for its extinction.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was put in place in August 2023 following the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve relations with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities, but imports will be conditional on Japanese facilities being registered and products passing radiation checks.</p>
