          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after a decades-long battle to regain control of his song catalog. After the band's breakup in 1972, Fogerty lost the rights to his own compositions, a painful experience that led him to stop performing them for many years. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he eventually bought back the rights and recorded "Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)" with his sons, allowing him to finally present his iconic songs like "Proud Mary" as he intended.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support thousands of UK jobs and hundreds of businesses. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian frigates designed to operate jointly in the North Atlantic, enhancing capabilities to monitor Russian submarine activity and protect critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>In his new book, CNN's chief medical correspondent and neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta investigates the complex nature of chronic pain, revealing that its source often lies within the brain itself. The article highlights the story of a heavy metal musician who suffered from a rare, excruciating condition for decades until a revolutionary clinical trial involving deep brain stimulation mapped and interrupted his pain signals. This research demonstrates that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and treatable, offering hope that new, less invasive therapies can be developed to manage a condition affecting millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's transfer window is set for a frantic finale, with several high-profile moves anticipated before Monday's deadline. The most prominent saga involves Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, who is attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a deal that seems more likely now that Newcastle is close to signing a replacement. Elsewhere, Arsenal completed a dramatic £60m hijacking of Eberechi Eze from Tottenham, while Crystal Palace is in negotiations to sell captain Marc Guehi to Liverpool. Manchester United is also expected to be active, focusing on offloading several players.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues Hunting Can Be an Ethical and Sustainable Form of Meat Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:00:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal hunter challenges the common progressive disdain for hunting, arguing it is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. The author recounts the emotionally complex experience of hunting, emphasizing the deep connection to nature and the responsibility one assumes for their own sustenance. The article posits that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with license fees and taxes on firearms funding wildlife management, and that their intimate knowledge of ecosystems makes them key stewards of the land.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of rebuilding her life after her husband died suddenly when she was 26, leaving her a young widow. Initially believing she would never remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who became her second husband and, in her words, her "biggest cheerleader." Their relationship not only provided companionship but also inspired her to pursue a new life path, leading her to become a full-time author and speaker while living on a sailboat, a life she had never previously imagined for herself.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White reflects on the challenge of playing Bruce Springsteen in the film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the artist's stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." White describes the daunting task of embodying a cultural icon, particularly during a period when Springsteen was battling depression and feeling fraudulent as a person despite his professional success. The actor drew parallels between Springsteen's struggles with generational trauma and his role as chef Carmy in "The Bear," noting both characters use their art as a refuge from profound internal conflict.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing.

The winner can choose between receiving the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or an immediate cash lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the little-known origins of surfing on the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were attending a nearby military school, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and introduced the sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of what was then a royal Hawaiian tradition captivated locals and planted the seeds for a culture that would eventually sweep the nation, long before it was popularized globally in the 20th century.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece delves into the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world faces numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author draws on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is natural to feel the pain of others. However, the essay argues that this connection should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy." The author concludes that allowing oneself to feel both horror and delight is not a contradiction but a necessary part of human resistance and well-being.</p>
