          <p>This article reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly reduced the threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. Previously, these sectors faced potential tariffs as high as 250% and 100% respectively, but new details of the US-EU agreement now cap them at 15%. However, the deal includes a condition: the 27.5% tariff on European car exports will only be reduced to 15% once the EU passes legislation to cut its own industrial duties to zero. This agreement, described as a "first step," aims to provide stability in the world's largest trading partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order concerning stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing authorities to catch, sterilize, and immunize the animals before releasing them, except for rabid or aggressive cases. The court also banned public feeding of strays, mandating designated feeding zones and threatening legal action for violations. This article notes that the decision follows widespread protests against an earlier order for mass removal and relocation, with critics highlighting logistical challenges and the importance of existing animal birth control rules. The court will centralize similar cases to form a nationwide policy.</p>

          <p>Morecambe Football Club has become the first professional English team owned by Sikh investors, Panjab Warriors, a move highlighted in this article as a significant cultural breakthrough. Following the takeover, Ashvir Singh Johal was appointed as the first Sikh manager of a professional British club. The new ownership group aims to infuse the club with Sikh principles like discipline and compassion, hoping to attract a global Sikh fanbase. This development is seen as an inspiration for the Sikh community, which has historically been underrepresented in British football.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of royal insult (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court, avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he commented on the 2014 military coup, which prosecutors argued defamed the monarchy. This article highlights that the court's decision, interpreting the law literally and finding insufficient evidence, brings relief to his family's influential political movement. Critics often view Thailand's strict lese majeste law as a tool to suppress political dissent.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, aiming to save £350 million over five years. This article explains that a new specialist team will utilize travel data to identify claimants who are ineligible after spending more than eight weeks outside the UK, unless under exceptional circumstances. A pilot program already recovered £17 million from 2,600 incorrect claims. The initiative seeks to raise awareness of the rules and will expand to over 200 investigators from next month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This article highlights findings published in the journal Science, based on surveys in maize fields in Hainan. The research indicates that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also reduced growth. This mechanism offers valuable clues on how optimizing linalool release could be used to combat pests and potentially increase crop yield, contributing to agricultural advancements.</p>
