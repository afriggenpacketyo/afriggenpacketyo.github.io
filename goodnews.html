          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is primarily attributed to the high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division constituted 60% of its revenue, underscoring the AI boom's impact. Despite this strong performance, TSMC acknowledges potential risks from U.S. tariff policies and export controls affecting its business with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars reported a second-quarter operating profit that surpassed analyst expectations, causing its stock to rise over 10%. Despite this, the profit of 2.9 billion Swedish kronor marked a significant drop from the 8 billion kronor reported in the same period last year. The company is navigating a challenging automotive market and the impact of U.S. tariffs by adjusting its U.S. production strategy. Volvo plans to start producing its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant to mitigate tariff impacts and better utilize its American manufacturing assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential new trade deal between the United States and China could closely resemble the phase one agreement from Donald Trump's first term, according to former Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Biegun suggested the core of a new pact would likely involve substantial Chinese purchases of American agricultural and industrial goods. This structure aims to address the trade imbalance, which the U.S. president uses as a key metric for economic fairness. The original phase one deal, signed in 2020, was only partially fulfilled, a factor that current negotiators are reportedly considering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Sands has commenced construction on an $8 billion "ultra luxurious" resort in Singapore, a major expansion of its Marina Bay Sands property. The new development will feature a 55-story all-suite hotel, high-end retail, and a 15,000-seat arena designed by the team behind the Las Vegas Sphere. The project is a standalone entity, not merely an extension, and includes a public rooftop space with an observation deck and gardens. This significant investment aligns with Singapore's long-term strategy to boost tourism, particularly by attracting high-value leisure and business travelers with world-class entertainment and facilities.</p>

          <p>After years of delays, Elon Musk's engagement with the Indian market is advancing, marked by the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai and regulatory approval for Starlink's satellite internet service. Tesla is initially targeting India's premium vehicle segment with its high-priced Model Y, requiring investment in a dedicated charging infrastructure. Meanwhile, Starlink aims to address rural internet connectivity gaps, likely through government and business partnerships rather than mass-market consumer sales. This strategic pivot towards India provides Musk with new growth avenues while aligning with India's "Make in India" initiative and digital infrastructure goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a significant boost in defense funding. The plan allocates €131 billion for defense and space investment, a fivefold increase from current levels, reflecting a broader European "era of rearmament" amid geopolitical instability. Overall, the budget framework aims to streamline funding access and introduces new revenue streams to support its goals, including climate projects and aid for Ukraine. The proposal must now gain unanimous approval from all EU member states, with some, like the Netherlands, already signaling the proposed amount is too high. (not investment advice)</p>

Nvidia has been navigating complex U.S. export controls that have restricted its access to the significant Chinese market. The company recently resumed sales of its H20 chip, a less-advanced version designed to comply with American restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Emirates flight from Dubai to Hong Kong was forced to divert to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after being unable to land at its destination. Flight data indicated that the Boeing 777 aircraft made at least two unsuccessful landing attempts and circled the area before the crew made the decision to divert. The crew and passengers remained in Kaohsiung overnight before flying back to Hong Kong the next day. An aviation observer cited in reports suggested that weather conditions, including sustained winds of about 12 knots, may have contributed to the difficulties the flight crew experienced during the approach.</p>
