          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions, stating they have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." This statement followed the Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and affirmed the UK's continued support for Ukraine. He also welcomed the U.S.'s willingness to provide robust security guarantees as part of a potential deal, highlighting international cooperation in the ongoing pursuit of a resolution.</p>

          <p>Samsung is intensifying its rivalry with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share slightly declined. This resurgence is largely driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors beyond the traditional smartphone design. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of price points and willingness to experiment with new technology are creating competitive pressure. Analysts anticipate Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhone models in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful strategies for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to handle stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. She advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that the frustration of learning is a normal part of growth, not a sign of failure. Kennedy also emphasizes the importance of engaging in positive self-talk to shift internal dialogues from self-criticism to support and understanding. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body and mind to tolerate discomfort and build resilience over time.</p>

She has built a thriving brand that includes a TV network, retail market, and hotel, all while remaining rooted in the community where she and her husband, Chip, first found success.

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia, which Trump described as a more durable solution than a temporary ceasefire. European leaders were reportedly briefed on the Trump-Putin talks and expressed support for U.S.-led security guarantees for Ukraine. This development marks a direct diplomatic follow-up to the Alaska summit, shifting the focus to direct engagement with Ukraine's leadership to forge a path toward peace.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, driven by growing concerns about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend coincides with recent medical findings, including from the World Health Organization, stating that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for one's health. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates dropping significantly over the past two decades, a positive development for public health.</p>

The firm argues that self-inflicted mistakes and a flawed leadership structure have led to a significant decline in shareholder value, suggesting a sale of the company as an alternative path.

The artifact, a decorative piece about 1.5 inches long, was found near the route of a major Roman road, suggesting the area was used by high-status individuals long after the Roman Empire's decline. Experts believe the object, along with a similar one found nearby in 2021, may have been part of a pair with religious or ceremonial significance.

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by fiber-optic cables, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The company, Fold, aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind the front lines. This innovation is a response to the evolving battlefield, where enemy positions have moved farther apart, rendering shorter-range drones less effective. While longer cables present technical challenges, the development signifies a crucial advancement in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Empower found that Americans believe the ideal age to start saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by age 58. However, certified financial planners advise that starting even earlier can be significantly more beneficial due to the power of compound interest. Data shows that younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are indeed starting to save earlier than their predecessors, often in their early 20s. While achieving retirement in one's late 50s is possible when starting at 27, experts emphasize that an earlier start provides a much larger financial cushion. (not investment advice)</p>
