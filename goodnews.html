          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent backed by left-wing parties, has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland after securing a landslide victory with 63% of first preference votes. Connolly pledged to be an inclusive president, advocating for peace, neutrality, and addressing climate change, in her acceptance speech delivered in both Irish and English. Humphreys, Connolly's rival, conceded defeat and wished her well, acknowledging Connolly's role as president for all citizens. Connolly will succeed Michael D Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin praised Connolly's election, highlighting the clear mandate given by the people.

          <p>President Trump, en route to the ASEAN summit, expressed his openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, potentially marking their first encounter since 2019. Trump emphasized his positive relationship with Kim and indicated willingness to engage in dialogue. However, Kim has stated he would only meet if Washington recognizes North Korea as a nuclear state, a demand Trump addressed by acknowledging North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Seoul's reunification minister suggested a "considerable" chance of a Trump-Kim meeting, setting the stage for potential diplomatic developments in Asia.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey advises a Georgia woman, Brandy, to take immediate action regarding her husband's financial secrecy, emphasizing the importance of financial independence within a marriage. Ramsey suggests counseling, demanding transparency, or considering leaving the relationship if necessary. The article highlights steps towards regaining financial independence, such as opening a bank account, tracking expenses, and building an emergency fund. It also underscores the need for financial equality in marriage through joint budgeting, discretionary funds for both spouses, and open communication about financial matters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An online graphic claiming the UK has the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe is misleading due to variations in legal definitions and reporting practices. The article explains that the UK's higher rate reflects its broader definition of sexual assault and its reporting practices, where a case is counted upon filing a police report. Criminologists suggest victim surveys as a more accurate measure, noting that crime statistics only capture reported cases. The article also refutes claims linking immigration to sexual assault rates, highlighting that the UK and the Netherlands have similar shares of foreign-born residents but vastly different reported sexual assault rates.</p>

          <p>Germany plans to enhance its surveillance capabilities by acquiring eight Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft to detect Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius observed a reconnaissance flight, highlighting the importance of monitoring Russian submarine activity and protecting critical infrastructure. The collaboration between Germany and the UK will strengthen NATO's capabilities in the region. The move is part of a broader effort to increase European responsibility for security and defense, sending a message to both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin about NATO's readiness and capabilities.</p>

Strategas Securities highlights the record-high weighting of technology in the S&P 500 and renewed interest in small-cap stocks.
