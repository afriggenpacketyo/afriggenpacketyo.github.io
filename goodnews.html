          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 05:50:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leicester City has been referred to an independent commission by the Premier League for allegedly breaching EFL financial rules during the 2023-24 season when they were in the Championship. While a tribunal previously ruled that the Premier League couldn't punish Leicester for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules for the 2022-23 season due to their relegation, it did grant the Premier League jurisdiction to investigate the EFL rule breach. The commission will also assess allegations that Leicester failed to provide accounts by December 31, 2024, and didn't fully cooperate with the Premier League's inquiries. Leicester stated they intend to cooperate with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 16% in their Hong Kong debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest globally this year. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. This expansion coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs due to unfair trade practices, and allegations of CATL's ties to the Chinese military, which the company denies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer will not raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. More than half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports to reduce reliance on China. This pricing strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to cover tariff costs. While Home Depot missed first-quarter earnings expectations, it beat sales estimates and maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating a 2.8% sales growth and a 1% increase in comparable sales, contingent on current tariff agreements remaining in place.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are warning of increased solar activity, including solar flares and storms, as an active region of the Sun rotates into view, potentially causing auroras and blackouts on Earth. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory recently captured the most powerful eruption of 2025, an X2.7 flare, which triggered radio blackouts across parts of the Middle East. Ongoing flares and solar eruptions could impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. The Met Office also forecasts the possibility of Northern Lights over the UK and Ireland due to the increased solar activity.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Patti Davis reflects on her father Ronald Reagan's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis and suggests that Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis presents an opportunity for him to demonstrate leadership on a human level. Davis argues that Biden can connect with millions facing similar struggles by openly discussing his experience and fears. She emphasizes that such candor could restore trust with voters who feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. By sharing his personal journey, Biden could transcend political divides and show the shared fragility and strength of human beings.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities, despite stylistic differences. Both men positioned themselves against the political establishment, championed conservative ideas, and appealed to blue-collar voters. Reagan's stance against the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy are cited as examples of his anti-establishment views, mirroring Trump's policies. The author contends that both leaders acted on their conservative ideas and were cherished by Republicans for doing so, with the article emphasizing the importance of the individual in their ideologies.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary roll thruster on Voyager 1, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, relies on these thrusters to maintain its antenna's alignment with Earth. The thrusters had been out of use for two decades due to a suspected electronics glitch, and engineers risked a potential explosion by attempting to reactivate them. This repair was crucial as the Deep Space Station 43, used to communicate with the Voyager probes, was scheduled to go offline for upgrades, limiting communication options. The successful revival ensures the spacecraft can continue its mission and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>
