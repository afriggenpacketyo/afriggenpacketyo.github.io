          <p>NASA and SpaceX postponed the launch of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station due to unfavorable weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Center. The crew includes astronauts who were rescheduled from a previous flight because of issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule, which required their seats for a return trip. The mission's commander, Zena Cardman, expressed that spaceflight is a team effort and she is grateful for the journey despite the unexpected changes. This flight will use the Crew Dragon Endeavour, marking a record sixth flight for the capsule as SpaceX works toward certifying its vehicles for up to 15 missions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 90-day extension of the current tariff rates on Mexican goods, postponing a threatened increase to allow for further trade negotiations. President Trump confirmed the decision after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, stating the deal maintains a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on metals. The article notes that this extension highlights the lack of a broader trade agreement between the U.S. and its largest trading partner. The goal is to sign a new trade deal within the 90-day period.

          <p>This article delves into the phenomenon of impostor syndrome, where high-achieving individuals secretly feel like frauds despite their genuine accomplishments. Citing the example of author John Steinbeck, it explains that this feeling is common among professionals in technical fields and those in positions of trust, such as doctors. The article suggests that while some believe it can motivate improvement, it often leads to burnout and anxiety. To combat these feelings, it recommends practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of growth, and building a supportive peer community.</p>

          <p>Speculation about a new international basketball league has intensified after Nikola Jokic's agent, Misko Raznatovic, posted a photo of a meeting with LeBron James and his business partner Maverick Carter. The proposed league, described as the "F1 of basketball," is reportedly backed by a group of investors seeking $5 billion and would feature a touring model with teams playing in eight cities, likely outside the U.S. The league may require players to cut ties with the NBA, similar to the LIV Golf model. Raznatovic's social media post hinted at a potential launch in the fall of 2026.</p>

The bank, which already has the most branches in the U.S., plans to open another 500 locations by 2027. This strategy runs counter to the broader industry trend of branch closures, as JPMorgan aims to capture more deposits and serve a larger portion of the U.S. population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The College Sports Commission (CSC), the new body overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, has relaxed its standards for agreements between student-athletes and third-party collectives.

This change came after plaintiff attorneys threatened further legal action, arguing the initial guidance was too restrictive.

Under the plans, the small business commissioner would gain the power to issue fines, and invoice payment terms would be limited to a maximum of 60 days. The government claims late payments, estimated to total £26 billion at any given time, are a primary issue for small firms and contribute to thousands of business failures annually.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed a surprising origin for the potato, suggesting its lineage began 8 to 9 million years ago from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and a flowering plant from the Etuberosum group. Researchers found that this improbable union created a new plant that, unlike its parents, could form tubers—the nutrient-storage organs we eat as potatoes. This unique ability allowed the proto-potato to thrive in new, harsher environments and diversify into over 100 species. The discovery reframes hybridization not as an evolutionary dead end but as a powerful force for creating novel traits.</p>
