          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and pressure of modern tipping culture, particularly with automated payment screens that prompt for high percentages. He contrasts the minimal effort of a server bringing eggs with the heavy lifting of buying cat litter, questioning the logic behind the expected gratuity. Through his signature wit and personal anecdotes about his immigrant grandparents, Sedaris explores the feelings of guilt and social obligation that now accompany even the simplest transactions.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their collaborative "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated traditional Mexican huarache sandals. The controversy arose because the design, inspired by Indigenous artisans, was reportedly made in China without crediting or partnering with the Oaxacan communities who originated it. Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, spoke out against the issue, prompting Adidas to engage in discussions about making restitution for the plagiarism.</p>

          <p>Goldie Chan, a branding agency founder and self-described introvert, asserts that developing a strong personal brand is essential for career advancement, particularly for those who are naturally less outspoken. The article explains that a personal brand is simply what people know you for professionally and that it allows individuals to shape their own narrative rather than being underestimated. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like networking or posting online, to build confidence and visibility, emphasizing that unique interests outside of work also contribute to a powerful professional identity.</p>

          <p>A review of Frances Wilson's biography, "Electric Spark," delves into the complex life of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer often obscures her significance as a major religious author. The article highlights how Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism profoundly shaped her work, allowing her to explore themes of divine judgment and human fallibility with a signature dark wit. It discusses how she used narrative techniques like omniscience and prolepsis to "play God," creating absurdist storylines that reflect the collision between God's unknowable will and human shortsightedness.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, quit their jobs and moved with their young son to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical to allow him to bond with his paternal grandparents. After five years of saving $60,000, they embraced a slower pace of life, which Jason says has been transformative for his mental health and perspective on career success. The experience allowed them to reassess their priorities, realizing they could live happily on less money and focus more on family, leading them to plan for a more flexible work-life balance upon their return.</p>

          <p>As cyberattacks become more sophisticated with the help of generative AI, companies are fighting back by integrating autonomous AI agents into their own cybersecurity forces. These AI "teammates" are being used to automate routine tasks like monitoring for threats, analyzing alerts, and responding to incidents, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex strategic work. While still in early stages, experts believe this technology is essential for defenders to keep pace with AI-powered attackers and can help alleviate the talent shortage and burnout in the cybersecurity industry.</p>

The country offers a significant advantage for Americans, allowing them to live visa-free for up to a year, making it an ideal place to "test drive" expat life without complex paperwork. With a low cost of living, a growing expat community, and a friendly attitude toward Americans, Albania is emerging as an attractive and accessible option for digital nomads, retirees, and families seeking a new life in Europe.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Michigan State University have confirmed the presence of black bears in the Lansing swamp area using trail cameras, signaling the species' continued migration into the state's southern peninsula. This southern movement is believed to be a positive sign of a healthy and growing bear population, partly due to state limits on hunting licenses. Wildlife officials consider the bears a vital part of the ecosystem and have issued guidance to residents on how to coexist peacefully, such as securing trash and removing bird feeders to avoid attracting them.</p>

          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing shoppers temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies and clothing. While politically popular, tax experts note the benefits are often overstated, suggesting they primarily shift the timing of purchases rather than stimulating new economic growth. However, for many families, especially those with lower incomes, these holidays offer a real opportunity to save on essential back-to-school shopping, particularly when combined with other store promotions and discounts.

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, Orkney, discovered the hull of a 275-year-old ship that washed ashore after a storm. Community researchers and archaeologists worked together to identify the vessel as the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy ship named HMS Hind. The ship had a storied history, serving the British during the American Revolution before being sold as a whaler. It ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the psychological reason why people are drawn to negative news, a phenomenon known as negativity bias, which is an evolutionary trait for threat detection. It argues that this bias, combined with the media's focus on problems, can obscure real, tangible progress happening in the world, such as falling murder rates and fewer deaths from extreme weather. The author advocates for "realistic optimism," suggesting that focusing on positive developments is not naive but a necessary tool for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve problems.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite called a chondrite, created a loud boom and was seen as a fireball across several states before fragments landed. Researchers are studying the meteorite's composition to better understand the history of our solar system and the potential threat of future asteroid impacts.</p>
