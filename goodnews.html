          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, dubbed "Gwada negative." The discovery, made by France's blood supply agency (EFS), marks the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The woman is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, which was identified through high-throughput DNA sequencing. Scientists are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad</h2>

          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are less effective than many available overseas, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. The concern comes as a heat wave is arriving for millions of people across the US. The FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years, while other countries have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval. </p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms. The court ruled that the mandate violates the separation of church and state. Civil liberties groups celebrated the ruling, while the Louisiana Attorney General plans to appeal the decision. The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by parents who argued the law violates First Amendment rights. </p>
