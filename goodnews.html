          <h2>Turkey Considers New Regulations to Combat Hotel Buffet Food Waste</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is actively considering new regulations to curb significant food waste, particularly targeting all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditionally large breakfasts. Advisors to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are developing proposals, prompted by reports from the Waste Prevention Foundation of Turkey, which indicate 8.7 million tons of food are discarded annually in the country. Restaurateur Ramazan Bingol, a member of the Presidential Council for Agriculture and Food Policy, emphasizes that nearly half of the food in popular "Serpme Kahvalti" breakfasts is wasted, advocating for customizable menus and flexible billing to empower guests. This initiative seeks to address pressing economic problems and environmental damage, though it faces potential resistance and skepticism from the tourism sector, which values the current all-inclusive model.</p>

          <p>Kira Chathli, a 26-year-old cricketer, has emerged as an unexpected leading run-scorer in The Hundred women's competition, despite initially going unsold in this year's draft. She was signed by London Spirit as a replacement for an injured captain and has since delivered 160 runs in six matches with an impressive strike-rate. Chathli attributes her significant improvement to dedicated strength and conditioning training, which has enhanced her hitting power and overall fitness, allowing her to trust her timing rather than over-hitting. A chemistry graduate and co-founder of a cricket coaching academy for young girls, she brings a fearless playing style and tactical intelligence to the game, marking a notable upward trajectory in her career.</p>

          <p>At 30, self-made billionaire Lucy Guo maintains a relentless work ethic and strict daily routine, which includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, back-to-back gym sessions, and frequently no lunch breaks. Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and founder of Passes, attributes her high productivity to meticulously optimizing her day and consciously avoiding perceived time-wasting activities like "doom scrolling" on social media. She advocates for intense working hours, particularly for new founders, drawing parallels to China's "996" work culture, believing it's necessary to get companies off the ground. Despite her entrepreneurial success, Guo's latest startup, Passes, is embroiled in a class action lawsuit alleging distribution of child sexual abuse material, an accusation she vehemently denies as a "total shakedown."</p>

          <p>Mission Viejo clinched a hard-fought 7-3 victory over Santa Margarita in an intense opening high school football game, which resembled a Southern Section Division 1 playoff match. The decisive play came late in the third quarter when Ohio State commit Luke Fahey delivered a crucial 33-yard touchdown pass to Jack Junker, effectively erasing a 3-0 deficit. Fahey, showcasing exceptional mobility and instincts, completed 16 of 22 passes for 169 yards against Santa Margarita's formidable and aggressive defensive line. The game was characterized by dominant defensive performances from both teams, with Mission Viejo ultimately securing the win by stopping Santa Margarita on fourth down from the eight-yard line with just 26 seconds remaining on the score.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a narrow 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, causing them to relinquish their two-game lead and fall back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The Dodgers' offense struggled significantly, managing only three hits throughout the game, largely due to a dominant six-inning performance from Padres pitcher Yu Darvish. Despite a stellar seven-inning outing from Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell, who delivered his best performance since returning from injury, the team failed to capitalize on crucial scoring opportunities. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the disappointment of squandering their lead but emphasized the team's immediate focus on winning the next game in this critical divisional series.</p>

          <p>Award-winning HIV scientist Shan Liang, previously a tenured associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine, has relocated to Shenzhen, China, to lead the Institute of Human Immunology at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART). Shan's expertise lies in studying the immunobiology of HIV infection and developing innovative strategies to combat the virus, with a specific focus on identifying unknown immune mechanisms that could potentially lead to an HIV cure, as only a few bone-marrow transplant cases have achieved this. SMART has highly praised his research for establishing crucial foundations in understanding HIV immunobiology and developing new generations of drugs, notably his discovery of novel mechanisms by which HIV kills target cells.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Bans Raw Rare Earth Exports Amid US Demand for Non-Chinese Sources</h2>

          <p>Malaysia has enacted a ban on exports of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move aimed at retaining these critical resources onshore to stimulate investment in downstream industries and assert its geoeconomic agency. This decision is particularly significant as the mineral-hungry United States is actively seeking non-Chinese sources for these globally prized raw materials, which are essential for various electronic hardware components. Malaysia's Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry, Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz, indicated that foreign investors are welcome to participate if their projects incorporate local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts suggest Malaysia's existing processing capacity provides a considerable head start in integrating into global supply chains, potentially positioning it as a vital alternative supplier for the US.

          <p>Hong Kong has officially surpassed the U.S. as the leading venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies, marking a significant milestone for the city's capital market. In the first eight months of 2025, a substantial 46 Chinese companies raised a combined $16.5 billion via IPOs on the Hong Kong stock exchange, starkly contrasting with just 16 listings that raised $740.9 million in the U.S. over the same period. This notable shift is primarily driven by Hong Kong's more active and recovering market, where new shares have seen an average jump of 19.4% in their trading debuts, alongside lingering US-China rivalry that introduces uncertainty and delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the American market.
