          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff addressed investor concerns after the company's stock fell over 5% following its latest earnings report. Despite beating revenue and earnings estimates, Wall Street was disappointed by the company's future guidance, which Benioff described as "appropriately conservative." He highlighted the success of Salesforce's AI products and recent competitive wins against rivals like Palantir, asserting that the company's performance remains strong despite the market's reaction and a significant year-to-date stock decline.

          <p>A series of high-level meetings conducted by Chinese President Xi Jinping has highlighted key tenets of China's current foreign policy. A central theme in discussions with various world leaders has been the importance of multilateralism and upholding the United Nations-centered international order. This stance positions Beijing as a champion for a multipolar world, often in implicit contrast to the unilateralism it associates with the United States. These diplomatic efforts aim to forge closer economic cooperation and present a unified front against perceived global power imbalances.</p>

Similarly, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 1% following positive household spending data.

          <p>This article delves into the difficult decision of what to do with a beloved but aging family vehicle, a 20-year-old Chrysler minivan. The author explores the various paths available: selling it for a low price, donating it to a charity that repairs cars for families in need, or recycling it through an environmentally-certified salvage yard. The piece highlights the growing longevity of modern cars and the environmental and economic factors influencing when to retire a vehicle. It provides a detailed look at the auto recycling process, where cars are demanufactured and their parts are salvaged for reuse.</p>

          <p>Leaders from approximately 30 allied nations are meeting in Paris to finalize a plan for providing security guarantees to Ukraine once the war with Russia ends. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated that allies are prepared to help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land as part of an eventual peace deal. The proposed plan reportedly includes continued military training, arms supplies, and the potential deployment of European troops to deter future aggression. However, the success of the initiative is seen as heavily dependent on securing a commitment from the United States to act as an ultimate backstop.</p>

The program was established after a campaign by the parents of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died from sepsis after her family's concerns were dismissed. The pilot has already led to nearly 5,000 calls and hundreds of potentially life-saving interventions.</p>

          <p>A new 'braided career' initiative in Scotland aims to address the critical shortage of computing teachers by allowing tech industry professionals to transition into education without leaving their jobs. In a pilot program with the tech firm Skyscanner, four employees are training to become teachers while receiving their full company salary. Upon graduation, they will work part-time for both Skyscanner and a local school, bringing current industry expertise into the classroom. The project hopes to reverse a two-decade decline in computing teacher numbers and inspire more students to pursue careers in technology.</p>
