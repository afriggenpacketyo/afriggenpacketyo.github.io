          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 6% following a report indicating that IBM can utilize AMD's field-programmable gate array chips to run specific quantum error-correction algorithms. IBM's shares also gained significantly, heading for their best day since January. This positive development underscores the ongoing collaboration between the two tech giants, who previously announced an agreement to develop quantum computing capabilities, with IBM planning to debut a quantum computer by 2029. The report has fueled renewed interest across the quantum computing sector, boosting stocks of other companies like D-Wave Quantum, Rigetti Computing, and IonQ, as technology leaders race to innovate in this transformative field.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has suffered a significant setback as left-handed reliever Alex Vesia was officially left off the World Series roster due to a deeply personal family matter. Vesia will not be placed on the Family Medical Emergency List, indicating his expected absence for the duration of the series unless an injury occurs elsewhere on the pitching staff. This unexpected development removes one of the team's most trusted left-handed arms during the postseason. To compensate, the Dodgers have added hard-throwing right-handers Edgardo Henriquez and Will Klein to the relief corps, necessitating a strategic adjustment for their critical championship games and potentially impacting their performance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.3% in September, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.0%, which was slightly lower than economists' expectations. This long-awaited report, the only official economic data released during the government shutdown, indicated generally muted inflation pressures despite a 4.1% jump in gasoline prices. Excluding food and energy, core CPI also registered a 3.0% annual rate, below estimates. This softer-than-expected data is seen as reinforcing the Federal Reserve's likelihood of cutting interest rates next week, providing a crucial economic glimpse amidst the suspension of other government data releases and boosting investor optimism.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Jana Partners, alongside NFL star Travis Kelce and corporate executives, has taken a significant stake in Six Flags Entertainment, aiming to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience. This intervention follows the underperformance of the Cedar Fair merger, exacerbated by severe weather and ongoing operational issues. Jana's plan includes modernizing consumer-facing technology, reexamining operating strategies during inclement weather, and reinvigorating advertising and marketing, potentially leveraging Kelce's celebrity as a unique asset. The ongoing search for a new CEO presents a critical opportunity to recruit a world-class operator to execute these initiatives and potentially explore strategic alternatives, such as selling underperforming parks or the entire company, to unlock value.</p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has firmly stated he will not discuss his future until after next year's World Cup, despite having rejected a lucrative offer from Al-Hilal and ongoing interest from major European clubs. Fernandes, who is set to make his 300th appearance for United, emphasized his deep commitment to achieving his dreams and winning trophies with the club, a sentiment strongly supported by his wife. He highlighted the importance of collective team achievements over individual praise and dismissed any notion of competition with teammate Kobbie Mainoo, viewing their different skill sets as complementary and beneficial for the team's overall performance.

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru achieved a significant victory in a local Welsh parliament by-election in Caerphilly, outperforming both the far-right populist Reform UK and the defending Labour Party. This result is seen as a bellwether for broader UK political trends, especially as Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is currently ahead of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party in national polls. Plaid Cymru's leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, hailed the win as a choice for "hope over division," positioning his party as the "real choice for Wales" and the only one capable of stopping "billionaire-backed Reform." The high turnout for a by-election suggests increased voter engagement and a shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase average Social Security retirement benefits by about $56 per month starting in January. This annual adjustment aims to help benefits keep pace with inflation, impacting approximately 75 million people receiving Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. While in line with expert estimates, the increase might not fully alleviate the struggle with higher prices for beneficiaries who rely on these payments as their primary income. The article details how to estimate the increase and notes that Medicare Part B premiums and tax withholdings will also affect final monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The decaying lakeside villa built for Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, unused since 2000, will temporarily host guided tours and events, aiming to prevent its demolition. Berlin's Finance Ministry, which had renewed an offer to give away the property due to hefty annual upkeep costs of €200,000, will continue to cover these expenses. The Wandlitz municipality, now managing the site, ultimately plans to raise funds for a full renovation, estimated at €300 million. This initiative addresses Germany's ongoing struggle with managing former Nazi sites, balancing the preservation of history with the prevention of far-right extremist gatherings, transforming a controversial landmark into a site for public engagement and education.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, known as "Brother Wang," an alleged Chinese fentanyl kingpin, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States, with Mexico's assistance. Zhang, who escaped house arrest in Mexico in July, is accused of international drug trafficking, money laundering, and forming alliances with powerful cartels like Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation. He is alleged to have laundered at least $20 million in the U.S. and facilitated fentanyl transfers from China to various continents. This extradition follows increased pressure from the Trump administration on Mexico and China to curb drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin that has largely replaced other opioids as a cause of overdoses.</p>

          <p>A fact-check article debunks a viral chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe," explaining why direct international comparisons of sexual assault statistics are misleading. The article highlights major differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors across countries, which significantly skew data. For instance, the UK's consent-based laws and counting methods inflate its reported figures compared to nations with narrower definitions. Criminologists recommend victim surveys over police reports for a more accurate measure of prevalence, as police statistics only capture a fraction of actual incidents. The article also debunks the false claim linking increased sexual assault rates to uncontrolled mass immigration, citing a lack of supporting evidence and emphasizing the complexity of crime data.</p>
