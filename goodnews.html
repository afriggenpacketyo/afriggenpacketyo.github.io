        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer, aiming to alleviate the impact of inflation. This measure is part of a broader relief package designed to counter the adverse economic effects of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which include a 25 percent levy on automobiles that significantly affects Japan's car industry. The subsidies are intended to ease financial burdens amid rising energy costs and trade tensions.</p>

Zhang Zhiwei from Pinpoint Asset Management noted that this trend aligns with improved export figures for April, but the outlook for the second half of the year remains uncertain due to the unclear trade relationship between China and the US.
