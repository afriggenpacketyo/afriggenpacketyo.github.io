          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to finalize the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire agreement. This truce, brokered by US President Donald Trump, took effect Friday and involves Hamas releasing Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. Starmer plans to commend Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and Trump for their pivotal roles, stressing the need for continued international coordination to secure the ceasefire and progress towards the deal's subsequent, more complex phases. The summit aims to end the two-year conflict, strengthen Middle East stability, and address critical issues such as Gaza's future governance and Hamas's disarmament.</p>

          <p>China has launched a commercial underwater data center in Hainan, a significant step in its bid for AI leadership. However, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart China's plans. The US, through the Trump administration, has fostered multi-billion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, supporting the construction of the Stargate UAE AI data center. This initiative aims to integrate major UAE institutions into a US-technology-based digital ecosystem. The article argues that the US's ability to pool resources with chipmakers and its growing convergence between investment and supply chain demands for companies like Nvidia pose a significant challenge to China's near-term data center industry dominance.

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, is receiving radiation and hormone therapy for prostate cancer, his spokesman confirmed. Diagnosed in May with an aggressive, hormone-sensitive form of the disease that had spread to his bones, Biden's radiation treatment began a few weeks ago and is expected to last five weeks. A person close to Biden reported he is responding well. Having left office as the oldest US president, health concerns followed his term, leading him to end his re-election bid. Biden, who lost his eldest son to brain cancer, has long advocated for cancer research and relaunched the "cancer moonshot" initiative.</p>

          <p>Hull KR stand-off Mikey Lewis delivered a stellar performance in the Super League Grand Final, scoring his team's first try in their historic victory over Wigan Warriors. The 24-year-old, who won the Rob Burrow Award for man of the match, is now strongly contending for a starting spot in England's Ashes series against Australia. His coach, Willie Peters, praised Lewis's growth and impact on the big stage, calling it a pivotal moment in his career. England coach Shaun Wane faces a selection dilemma with several talented players vying for positions, but Lewis's compelling performance has made a strong case for inclusion.</p>

          <p>Major airlines, including American, Southwest, Delta, United, and JetBlue, are proactively waiving flight-change fees and fare differences for customers affected by an impending coastal storm on the U.S. East Coast.

This measure provides flexibility for travelers booked through over a dozen airports, allowing them to reschedule without incurring additional costs. As of Saturday afternoon, flight delays and cancellations were minimal, suggesting airlines are managing the situation and offering necessary accommodations to passengers in advance of the weather event.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team, though underdogs, is thriving in the World Cup thanks to captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who have delivered "statement performances." Sciver-Brunt, recently a new mother, scored a record fifth World Cup century against Sri Lanka, while Ecclestone, the world's number one spinner, took 4-17 in the same match. England remains unbeaten after three games, sitting atop the table, and is well-positioned for a semi-final spot before facing favorites India and Australia. Their strong bowling attack, particularly the spin trio, is proving highly effective on slow surfaces, giving the team a much-needed boost after a challenging year.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football team, under interim coach Tim Skipper, emphatically proved they are "no one-hit wonder" by routing Michigan State 38-13, following their upset win against Penn State. The Bruins' offense, led by playcaller Jerry Neuheisel, scored 38 consecutive points, while the defense, coordinated by Kevin Coyle, stifled Michigan State's offense and forced turnovers. Skipper's motivational tactics have transformed the team from a winless start, with players rediscovering their joy for the game. This impressive turnaround positions Skipper as a strong candidate for the permanent coaching vacancy, showcasing the team's renewed focus and vitality.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been officially retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire following injuries sustained during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses that were spooked by construction noise, causing them to gallop five miles through the capital, resulting in injuries to four pedestrians and five soldiers. The horse suffered a broken bone and serious bleeding, making him unable to return to ceremonial duties. His retirement ensures his long-term welfare and marks a peaceful conclusion for an animal involved in a widely publicized and chaotic event.</p>

This endorsement came ahead of a proposal to treat the 2026 election as a de-facto independence vote. Despite UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's stance against another referendum, Swinney affirmed his commitment to delivering independence for Scotland, stressing the party will "win big" and secure Scotland's choice.</p>

          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand and refurbished items, driven by environmental awareness and a desire for emotional connection with their decor. This generation recognizes the massive carbon footprint of the furniture industry, where over 95% of consumed furniture is discarded annually, often due to cheap, mass-produced items designed for short lifecycles and difficult recycling. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest show skyrocketing interest in secondhand decor. Experts note that younger consumers value sustainability, budget constraints, and the personal investment required to restore older pieces, challenging the industry's reliance on disposable trends and new materials.</p>
