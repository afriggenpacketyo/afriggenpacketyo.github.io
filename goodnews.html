          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its consumer products by the end of 2027, aligning with a broader industry trend towards natural ingredients. This initiative extends to foods supplied to K-12 schools, which will be free of synthetic dyes by the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its products, like Uncrustables, are already compliant, the change will affect items such as sugar-free jams and certain Hostess snacks. This move follows similar pledges from other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of synthetic food additives.</p>

The match showcased the team's ambitious, attacking style under coach Andy Farrell, characterized by creative plays and numerous offloads. However, the victory was tempered by an injury concern for scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring.

          <p>Ukraine has executed a highly effective drone operation, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," striking airbases deep within Russian territory and inflicting significant damage on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. The coordinated attack reportedly involved 117 drones smuggled into Russia, which destroyed or damaged over 40 long-range bombers and an early-warning jet. This operation demonstrates a new and cost-effective strategy for smaller nations to counter the airpower of larger adversaries by targeting valuable assets at their supposedly safe rear bases.

According to this industry guideline, an ideal home should have 80% of the features a buyer loves, such as location and layout. Another 10% should consist of elements that can be improved over time, like paint or fixtures. The final 10% are aspects the buyer can learn to live with, such as a neighbor's fence.

          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting that U.S. gas prices will be at their lowest levels since 2021 this summer, potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. A recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary now that a ceasefire is in place. The typical summer trend involves a slow decline in prices due to increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early travel peaks. Despite recent volatility, year-over-year gas prices are down 12%, and experts note that Americans are spending a smaller portion of their income on fuel. (not investment advice)</p>
