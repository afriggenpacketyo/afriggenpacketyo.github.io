          <p>A massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted thousands of global online platforms has been resolved. The day-long disruption affected a wide range of services, including social media, gaming, banking, and travel, highlighting modern society's dependence on a few major cloud providers. Amazon attributed the problem to issues with its domain name system (DNS) in its eastern U.S. region, which prevented users from connecting to numerous websites and applications. The incident caused significant operational issues for companies like Southwest Airlines, Amtrak, and many others relying on AWS infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread internet outage on Monday was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error within Amazon Web Services' oldest and largest data center in northern Virginia. DNS acts as the internet's address book, and the failure meant AWS could not direct traffic to the websites and apps it hosts. This event underscores the risks of the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud computing giants, with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform controlling a significant majority of the market. Experts note that while such errors are common, the scale of this outage was a stark reminder of the internet's concentrated infrastructure.</p>

Goldman Sachs raised its 2025 full-year forecast from 4.8% to 4.9%, stating that the government's official target of "around 5 percent" growth appears to be largely on track. This optimistic revision comes despite ongoing domestic and external economic pressures. The adjustment reflects growing confidence among some foreign financial institutions in the resilience and trajectory of China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed former Everton and Burnley boss Sean Dyche as their new manager on a contract lasting until 2027. Dyche becomes the club's third manager this season, replacing Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked after just 39 days and failed to win any of his eight games in charge. The club, currently 18th in the Premier League, is turning to Dyche for his experience in stabilizing teams and avoiding relegation. The appointment is seen as a pragmatic move to ensure Premier League survival, shifting away from the tactical style Postecoglou attempted to implement.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities, aiming to become the world leader by 2030 through massive state and private investment. Startups like DeepSeek are developing large language models that rival top Western competitors at a fraction of the cost, while tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent are expanding their global AI infrastructure. Despite U.S. export controls on advanced chips, Chinese firms are innovating with existing hardware and leveraging a vast domestic market to scale new technologies quickly. This intense competition and focus on open-source models are closing the gap with Silicon Valley, reshaping the global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Declan Rice's role at Arsenal has evolved significantly since his arrival, transforming him from a traditional holding midfielder into a complete box-to-box player. The summer signing of deep-lying midfielder Martin Zubimendi has allowed Rice more freedom to utilize his running power and contribute to attacks, resulting in career-best numbers for goals and assists. This season, Rice leads Arsenal in key attacking metrics like ball carries and chances created, showcasing his versatility. The tactical adjustment by manager Mikel Arteta has been praised for maximizing the £105m player's all-around abilities, benefiting both his club and the England national team.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured a place in the World Series for the first time in over three decades after a dramatic 4-3 series victory over the Seattle Mariners. In the decisive seventh game of the American League Championship Series, George Springer hit a go-ahead three-run home run in the seventh inning to clinch the win. The Blue Jays, MLB's only Canadian franchise, will now face the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the championship series. The loss was a major disappointment for the Mariners, who remain the only active MLB team to have never appeared in a World Series.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified two protein enzymes that are crucial for the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. This discovery reveals a key mechanism that could be targeted to regulate the androgen receptor protein, which fuels the disease's progression. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offer a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating prostate cancer. The disease is one of the most common cancers among men worldwide, with an estimated 1.5 million new diagnoses each year.</p>

          <p>Scientists exploring the deep sea in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia have discovered several new species, including a tiny, glowing lantern shark and a semi-transparent porcelain crab. The research voyage, conducted by Australia's science agency CSIRO, has so far identified about 20 new species from the hundreds of specimens collected. The West Australian Lantern Shark, which grows up to 40cm, is bioluminescent and was found over 600 meters below the surface. The discoveries highlight how much of the world's oceans remain unexplored and underscore Australia's status as a major biodiversity hotspot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients opting to use the Chinese yuan for trade settlements instead of the U.S. dollar. Businesses report that customers from Southeast Asia and Central Asia are increasingly requesting yuan-based transactions, with some companies seeing such orders rise to as much as 20% of their total exports. This shift is partly driven by infrastructure projects in developing nations led by Chinese suppliers, which encourages the use of their native currency. The trend reflects a gradual but noticeable increase in the yuan's role in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

The installation will feature a series of large-scale sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, which will serve as habitats for transplanted, resilient local corals. The project aims to restore the area's marine ecosystem, which lost its natural reef decades ago, while also creating a unique ecotourism attraction accessible to snorkelers. Funded by the city and private donations, the first phase includes an underwater "traffic jam" of 22 concrete cars designed by artist Leandro Ehrlich.</p>
