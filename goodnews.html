          <p>At a rally in Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his 'One Big, Beautiful Bill,' highlighting its historic tax cuts and border security investments. He also previewed plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebration in 2026, which will include a 'Great American State Fair,' a UFC fight on the White House lawn, and a new National Garden of American Heroes.

          <p>Actress Jane Seymour, at 74, reveals she has maintained the same body size she had at age 17 through consistent, moderate habits rather than extreme diets or workouts. She emphasizes a diet rich in fish, vegetables from her own garden, and mindful eating, typically skipping breakfast and enjoying a substantial lunch. Seymour's fitness routine focuses on Pilates and Gyrotonics to build core strength, using light weights and her own body weight, which she credits for helping her avoid injury. She advocates for listening to one's body and choosing sustainable practices over drastic measures to feel good at any age.</p>

          <p>A previously lost handwritten letter by Thomas Jefferson from 1783 has been discovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter to Virginia's governor, Jefferson discusses the right of citizens to take up arms against autocratic rulers, referencing revolutionary movements in Europe and drawing parallels to the American colonies' fight for independence. The document, valued at around $90,000, also reveals Jefferson's anxiety over the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Revolutionary War. This finding provides a significant historical snapshot of a pivotal moment for the new nation and its influence on global democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>A North Korean man has successfully crossed the heavily militarized Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and has been taken into custody by South Korea's military. The civilian was detected near the Military Demarcation Line on Thursday, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation by South Korean troops to safely secure him. The mission was complex due to dense vegetation and the high risk of landmines in the area. This type of defection across the land border is rare, as most North Koreans escape through China. The individual is now being questioned by relevant authorities to determine the circumstances of his crossing.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the expanded Club World Cup reveals mixed results, with attendance figures averaging 35,000 but stadiums often appearing half-empty, particularly for weekday games. Extreme heat was a significant factor, with some matches played in 'oppressive' conditions, especially in cities like Washington D.C. On the field, the tournament has provided a rare chance to see how clubs from different confederations compare, with South American teams from CONMEBOL showing impressive strength. They achieved a win or draw in 77% of their games during the group and last-16 stages, outperforming their European counterparts from UEFA.</p>

          <p>Dozens of 300,000-year-old wooden artifacts discovered at the Gantangqing archaeological site in southwest China's Yunnan province suggest that wood was a primary material for toolmaking in ancient East Asia. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of its use has been scarce, making this find a world-class discovery that helps fill a major gap in understanding the Paleolithic era in the region. The discovery challenges the traditional view that stone was the dominant material for tools during this period. The Gantangqing site, located near Fuxian Lake, was previously named one of China's top ten archaeological finds in 2015 for its wealth of relics.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on or near Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright orange glow and a loud bang that was witnessed by dozens of people in the Scottish Highlands. Security cameras captured the event, allowing UKMON to calculate its trajectory and potential landing zone. The organization has asked hillwalkers to be on the lookout for the space rocks, though they acknowledge that finding them in the vast, mountainous terrain will be extremely difficult.</p>

The 22-year-old, who played a key role in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, stated the decision was made with his heart, as Bilbao is his home.

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to hydration multiplier powders to stay hydrated, but experts advise caution. While these products can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost through heavy sweating, especially during strenuous exercise, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. They are best used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, continuous water intake, and consulting a doctor before use is recommended for those with chronic illnesses.</p>

Despite his grim prognosis, Mays maintains a refreshingly pragmatic and peaceful attitude toward mortality, a decision supported by his close-knit group of friends, his estranged daughter with whom he has recently reconnected, and a long-time friend in Australia. Mays finds strength not in spirituality or bravery, but in the love and support of his community, believing it is better to live a shorter life with good quality than a longer one filled with miserable treatments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues for a renewed defense of liberal democracy, suggesting that many have forgotten its core justifications amidst modern critiques from both the left and right. It posits that the strongest defense lies in the concept of 'value pluralism,' as articulated by philosopher Isaiah Berlin. This idea holds that human values like justice, mercy, liberty, and equality are diverse, often incompatible, and cannot be perfectly harmonized into a single utopian system. Therefore, a liberal democracy, which protects individual freedom to choose between these competing values and allows for collective decision-making, is the most decent and humane form of governance, as it avoids the dangers of totalitarian 'monism.'</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets, accusing it of extensive manipulation of the Nifty 50 index.

SEBI's order cited the firm's 'egregious behaviour' and disregard for a previous advisory as reasons for the ban, stating the move is crucial for protecting market integrity and retail investors.
