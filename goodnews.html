          <p>The viral popularity of Labubu dolls on TikTok has created a lucrative market for counterfeiters, with authorities seizing thousands of dangerous fakes. Trading Standards officers in London discovered a massive cache of counterfeit products, including fake Labubu dolls that pose a serious choking hazard to children as they easily fall apart. The high demand and resale market for genuine dolls, which can be expensive, drive consumers toward cheaper but unsafe alternatives. Authorities warn these fakes are often made with toxic materials and disregard safety standards.</p>

          <p>In Lagos, Nigeria, a unique Christian church offers a vital community hub for the city's deaf population, conducting services entirely in sign language. For decades, the church has provided a space where attendees, who often feel isolated in mainstream society, can connect with their faith and with each other. Pastors preach in sign language, and the vibrations from drums cue the congregation for prayer and worship. The church also functions as a crucial support network and educational center, teaching sign language to members and their hearing children, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment.</p>

          <p>A new BBC series narrated by Sir David Attenborough, titled "Parenthood," explores the diverse and often extreme ways animals raise their young. The show highlights the immense sacrifices parents in the animal kingdom make, from an orangutan's decade-long teaching process to the ultimate sacrifice of the African social spider mother, who is eaten by her offspring. The director notes the series aims to capture universal themes of parenting and adaptation in a rapidly changing world. At 99 years old, Attenborough continues to provide compelling narration for these dramatic natural history stories.</p>

          <p>With news of a potential sequel, women are reflecting on the cultural impact of the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham." The movie, about a Punjabi girl in London who defies her family's expectations to play football, is remembered for making many South Asian women feel "heard and seen." For many, the film mirrored their own struggles against cultural and gender stereotypes in sports and life. While women's football has grown significantly since the film's release, the story of balancing cultural heritage with personal ambition remains a powerful and inspiring narrative for a generation of viewers.</p>

          <p>Observers are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. One analyst suggested that Modi's presence, alongside Russia, could provide an opportunity to resolve ongoing political differences between India and China. However, most experts quoted in the article believe Modi is unlikely to participate in the Beijing event. The speculation comes amid a recent, though fragile, thaw in diplomatic relations between the two Asian powers.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released after being held in ICE detention for two months. Clouatre was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, advocated for her release, which came after intervention from Senator John Kennedy's office. Now released on bond with an ankle monitor, she faces a lengthy immigration court process, in a case her lawyer calls an example of a "hyper-enforcement environment."</p>
