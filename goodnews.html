          <h2>Agatha Christie's Likeness Resurrected via AI for Writing Course</h2>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who passed away in 1976, has been digitally reanimated to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro. Using a "digital prosthetic" created with artificial intelligence and archival material, Christie's likeness and voice are brought back to life, though the course script and content were written by academic researchers. While the project has the blessing of Christie's family, it raises ethical questions about the use of AI to resurrect the dead, particularly concerning consent and the potential for misrepresentation. Despite the concerns, proponents argue that the course offers a new way for fans to engage with Christie's work and learn about the craft of writing.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are using powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. A new study estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. These findings could aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and designing a proposed China-led research base on the moon.</p>
