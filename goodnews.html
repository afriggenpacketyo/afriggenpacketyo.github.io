          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, nullifying the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to dismantle the agency. The judge deemed the administration's actions, including the removal of USIP's president and staff, a "gross usurpation of power" that violated the statute establishing USIP. The ruling details a forced takeover by DOGE officials, assisted by law enforcement, which the judge found exceeded constitutional authority. This decision underscores the importance of congressional oversight and the limitations on presidential power in restructuring government agencies.</p>

          <p>The UK and the EU have agreed on a deal to reset relations after Brexit, covering areas such as defense, fishing, food trade, and youth mobility. UK food exporters may benefit from fewer checks, but the UK will need to follow EU food standards. EU fishing vessels gain 12 more years of access to UK waters, while young people may have more opportunities to work and study in both regions. British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports, but implementation is uncertain. The article provides a balanced analysis of the potential impacts of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga, and Cocoteros belong to Equatorial Guinea, resolving a decades-long dispute with Gabon. The ICJ rejected Gabon's claim based on a 1974 treaty, ordering them to acknowledge a 1900 treaty that handed the islands to Spain.
