          <p>Major financial institutions are increasingly embracing stablecoins, viewing them as a revolutionary money-movement platform comparable to the advent of credit cards. Companies like Fiserv and Mastercard are integrating stablecoin technology, while firms such as SpaceX and ScaleAI already use them for global payments. Experts predict the stablecoin market, currently valued at $400 billion, could expand into a multi-trillion dollar industry as regulatory clarity improves and traditional banks enter the space. This growing adoption is fueling investor interest in companies like Circle, a leading stablecoin issuer. (not investment advice)</p>

The company has been aggressively pivoting to host high-performance computing for AI clients, a lucrative move reflecting a broader trend in the mining sector. This 12-year partnership is projected to generate over $10 billion in revenue, marking a significant turnaround for the formerly distressed company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft is officially retiring its infamous "blue screen of death," a hallmark of Windows operating system crashes since the early 1990s. The company announced the iconic blue error screen will be replaced with a black version in the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update. This change is part of a broader effort to streamline the unexpected restart experience for users, making it faster and less disruptive. Microsoft aims to reduce downtime during these restarts to just two seconds for most users, marking the end of an era for a sight familiar to generations of PC users.</p>

Sources indicate that under a new deal, existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not face cuts. The government's original bill aimed to save ¬£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability and sickness benefits. The concessions follow pressure from over 100 Labour MPs who opposed the reforms, which they argued were unfair to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the upcoming July deadlines for reimposing steep tariffs on imports from numerous countries. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the deadlines are "not critical" and could be pushed back, giving countries more time to negotiate trade deals with the U.S. This signal of flexibility suggests the administration may not hold firm to its "90 deals in 90 days" goal. The potential delay comes as the U.S. has only managed to strike framework agreements with China and the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After rising steadily since April, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see a decline this summer, according to a recent analysis. The article identifies three key dates when rates could fall: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A cooling inflation report or a formal rate cut by the Fed could lead lenders to lower their variable HELOC rates. While a July rate cut is uncertain, experts see a high probability of a reduction at the September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for 3- and 6-month terms, a high-yield savings account could potentially earn more over a 9-month period, assuming its variable rate remains steady. The choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. Locking in a CD rate may be preferable if rates are expected to fall.
