          <p>Jon Jones, a prominent figure in mixed martial arts, has announced his retirement, leading to the promotion of interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall to the undisputed title holder. UFC President Dana White confirmed Jones's retirement, prompting Aspinall to express his eagerness to activate the heavyweight division. Jones, who has a 28-1 record, previously held UFC titles at light heavyweight and heavyweight and was expected to have a unification bout with Aspinall before his injury. Aspinall has been campaigning for a fight with Jones, but the American decided against accepting the UFC's offer, making this a turning point in the UFC's heavyweight landscape. </p>

          <p>Jessi Toronjo, who lost her mother, stepfather, and two sisters in a 1989 murder, has spent decades healing from the trauma, with her stepbrother convicted of the crime. After the murders, Jessi was sent to live with relatives and eventually placed in foster care, leading to a sense of displacement and isolation. In adulthood, she reconnected with a childhood friend and cousin, which provided support and led to writing a book about her experiences. Despite ongoing legal battles related to her stepbrother's case, Jessi focuses on helping others and finding purpose in her survival, having also been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship doubled in 2024, driven by Germany's attractiveness for life, work, and study, as well as recent citizenship reforms. Dual citizenship, allowed under the new reforms, is a major incentive, as many Turks wish to retain their Turkish citizenship for voting rights and business ties. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to the increased interest in German citizenship. Despite integration, many Turks still feel rooted in their culture and consider Turkey their home, highlighting the complexities of identity and belonging for migrants in Germany. </p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit showing promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages using non-invasive methods. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA in urine. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, demonstrated the kit's ability to detect changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of tumors that were difficult to find by X-ray. This technology could be particularly valuable in areas with limited medical resources. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Led by Professor Li Lei, the study redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, organizing it into four distinct phases that reflect a unique metabolic state. These phases transition sequentially, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach integrates ancient wisdom with modern scientific inquiry, offering new insights into molecular life mechanisms. </p>
