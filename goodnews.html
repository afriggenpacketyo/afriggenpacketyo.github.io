          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office has adopted President Trump's aggressive social media tactics, including all-caps posts, nicknames, and satirical memes, to troll the former president and his allies. This article reports that Fox News hosts, typically supportive of Trump's online behavior, expressed dismay and called Newsom's style "childish" and "performative confrontational." Newsom's approach has garnered significant online engagement and followers, with even Steve Bannon acknowledging his "Trumpian vision of fighting." The governor justifies his actions by stating that if his mockery bothers people, they should look to the original source, highlighting the perceived double standard in media reactions to political online conduct.</p>

          <p>Interpol announced a major cybercrime crackdown in Africa, dubbed "Serengeti 2.0," resulting in over 1,200 arrests across 18 African countries and the United Kingdom. This article highlights that the operation, conducted between June and August, identified approximately 88,000 victims of fraud and illegal cryptocurrency networks, recovering $97.4 million and taking down 11,432 malicious infrastructures. Cybercrime now accounts for over 30% of reported crime in West and East Africa, underscoring the growing threat. Significant busts included dismantling 25 cryptocurrency mining centers in Angola, where seized equipment is now earmarked for power distribution, and disrupting a transnational inheritance scam in Ivory Coast that caused $1.6 million in losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to seek $2 billion from Congress for a comprehensive beautification project in Washington, D.C., working with a general contractor, Clark Construction. This article reports that the president, speaking during a visit to The People's House museum, stated Congress was "happy to do it," though he provided no further details on the request or a bidding process. The initiative aims to renovate streets and infrastructure, including replacing rusting poles and light bulbs, within a three-mile radius of the Capitol and White House. Trump promised to "beautify" the capital within 12 months, framing it as part of his administration's broader efforts, including a federal anti-crime initiative.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's tariff increases by diversifying sourcing, pushing costs to vendors, and strategically raising prices. This article reports that while tariff costs are rising for retailers, consumer spending has largely remained strong, and the impact hasn't been as severe as initially feared. Executives expect costs to continue increasing but are working to keep consumer prices down, with some raising prices on certain items while expanding discounts on others. Strong brands and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are proving crucial for companies to absorb economic pressures, making their earnings steadier despite profit margin concerns and trade uncertainties.

This article reports that DeepSeek's mention of a tailored "UE8M0 FP8" precision format signals a closer collaboration with China's domestic AI chip ecosystem. This development comes amidst Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's push for chip self-sufficiency.

          <p>This article offers commentary on the "MAGA World's" reaction to California Governor Gavin Newsom's social media trolling of President Trump, noting the hypocrisy of Fox News commentators. It highlights how figures like Dana Perino, who typically excuse Trump's behavior, expressed dismay at Newsom's similar tactics. The article suggests Newsom's parodies act as a mirror, forcing Trump's supporters to confront how his actions appear to others, and exposing their hypersensitivity despite their "Fuck your feelings" rhetoric. It argues that Newsom's approach reveals a deeper, unacknowledged awareness among Trump's base about the president's problematic conduct.</p>
