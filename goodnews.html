          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has evolved from a fledgling concept into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Launched by Vitalik Buterin and a small team, the platform's ability to run smart contracts has enabled the rise of decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized assets, attracting major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Despite its success, Buterin warns about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. The blockchain continues to be favored by institutions for its stability and security, solidifying its role as the essential plumbing for a new generation of financial services.</p>

          <p>England concluded day three of the fifth Test against India at 50-1, needing another 324 runs to secure a series victory. The hosts made steady progress in their chase of 374 before opener Zak Crawley was bowled by Mohammed Siraj just before the close of play. Earlier, India built a formidable lead of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite some sloppy fielding from England, who dropped six catches, the improved batting conditions set the stage for a tense and potentially record-breaking final two days at The Oval.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky's Angel Reese jokingly pointed a finger at Las Vegas Aces player Sydney Colson following a bizarre incident during a game against the Golden State Valkyries. For the second time in a week at a Valkyries road game, a neon green dildo was thrown onto the court, causing a brief stoppage in play. On social media, Reese humorously asked Colson why she kept throwing her "mean green" in different arenas, to which Colson replied with a smirking photo. The lighthearted exchange follows a similar incident during a Valkyries game against the Indiana Fever earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on influencers and algorithm-driven content rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, favoring creators like Aaron Parnas who provide rapid-fire updates on current events. This shift is driven by a preference for convenience and simplified explanations, though it raises concerns about misinformation and the lack of in-depth reporting. Despite fears over the platform's Chinese ownership and content quality, news consumption on TikTok is becoming a significant trend that reshapes how information is delivered and consumed.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured a commanding 97-7 victory over Spain, scoring 15 tries in a one-sided match at Welford Road. The dominant performance was overshadowed, however, by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer for a dangerous clearout in the second half. Packer now faces a potential suspension that could see her miss part of the upcoming Rugby World Cup. Despite the disciplinary issue, England showcased its depth and power, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick in the comprehensive win ahead of their final warm-up match against France.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Black People Will Swim is working to address a historical and dangerous disparity in swimming ability within the Black community. Founded by Paulana Lamonier, the group provides lessons to combat the legacy of segregation that limited access to pools for Black Americans for decades. Statistics show Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a public health crisis linked to this history of exclusion. By offering accessible lessons and scholarships, the organization aims to create a ripple effect, empowering a new generation with vital water safety skills and fostering more Black swim instructors and lifeguards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity last year than even California. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are taking advantage of streamlined state regulations and favorable economics that make solar cheaper than natural gas. The success is exemplified by communities like Babcock Ranch, a town powered almost entirely by solar that maintained power through Hurricane Ian. However, future growth faces headwinds from the federal rollback of tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Lions celebrated with the trophy, the feeling was bittersweet, as players and coaches acknowledged they had not reached their full potential during the tour. The series will be remembered for its close margins, particularly the dramatic Lions victory in the second Test in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that aligning your workout routine with your personality traits could make exercise more enjoyable and sustainable. Researchers found that extroverts often prefer high-intensity group activities like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals are drawn to goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. Conversely, those with more anxious tendencies may prefer private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts gravitate toward solo activities like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular regimen, people can find greater success by exploring different forms of exercise that better match their innate disposition.</p>
