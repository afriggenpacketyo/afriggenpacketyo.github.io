          <p>China is undergoing a transformation in its governance, increasingly relying on technocrats with elite academic and technical backgrounds rather than career politicians and lawyers. A recent study indicates that nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold PhDs, with a significant proportion coming from prestigious universities like Tsinghua University. This shift towards a technocratic meritocracy is seen as a philosophical shift rooted in Chinese tradition, where competence is valued over ideology. These state-affiliated roles offer stability amid economic uncertainty, attracting top talent to government positions.</p>

The move aims to make Uber accessible to those who prefer cash or lack bank cards, although individual drivers can opt out of accepting cash payments. The expansion coincides with a report suggesting shops and services may need to be forced to accept cash to protect those who rely on it. The new payment method allows passengers to select cash as their payment option on the app, with Uber providing credit for any change owed.</p>

          <p>Reform achieved significant success in recent local elections, securing the most votes and seats across 23 councils, surpassing traditional powerhouses like the Conservatives and Labour. The party's support is particularly strong in areas that voted heavily for Brexit in 2016, highlighting a continuing divide in British politics. Reform's success reflects a mood of disillusionment with the Conservatives and Labour, appealing to a distinctive segment of the population that feels left behind by globalization and holds conservative views on immigration. The party's gains pose a challenge for both major parties, requiring them to address the concerns of this segment of the electorate.</p>
