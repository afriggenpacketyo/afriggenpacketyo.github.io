          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. While the storm is forecast to strengthen, potentially reaching hurricane status, its long-term track remains uncertain, with current models suggesting it is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States. A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti, and residents in the affected Caribbean islands are warned of potential flash flooding and landslides.</p>

As part of the multi-year agreement, the platforms will gain access to official NHL data and logos, while the league aims to engage a new audience beyond traditional sports betting. The move comes amid regulatory scrutiny over whether these platforms constitute gambling, but the NHL expressed confidence in the customer protection measures in place.</p>

          <p>SEC Chair Paul Atkins affirmed that the agency remains vigilant in monitoring financial markets for manipulative behavior, even with the ongoing federal government shutdown limiting its operations. Atkins stated that essential staff are still working to detect suspicious activities, such as "pump and dump" schemes, and have already halted trading on several foreign companies showing signs of manipulation. The statement comes as stocks like Beyond Meat experience extreme volatility without company news, highlighting the type of trading patterns that draw regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia defeated England by six wickets in a Women's World Cup match, overcoming an early batting collapse to successfully chase down England's total of 244. A commanding 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland, who scored 98, and Ash Gardner, who made a rapid 104, anchored the Australian victory. Despite a strong start from their openers, England's middle order struggled to build momentum against Australia's disciplined bowling. The result reinforces Australia's position as a dominant force in the tournament, with both teams having already secured spots in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>English rugby great Emily Scarratt has announced her retirement from the sport at age 35, calling the recent World Cup win a perfect end to her 17-year international career. Scarratt, England's all-time leading point scorer and the 2019 World Player of the Year, said that while she could have continued playing, she felt it was the right time to step away on her own terms. Although she played a limited role on the field during the final tournament, she emphasized the importance of her contribution as a team player from the sidelines.</p>

          <p>Amid rising consumer debt and economic pressures, this article clarifies a common misconception about Chapter 13 bankruptcy, explaining that it does not require filers to surrender their entire income. Instead, individuals create a three-to-five-year repayment plan using only their "disposable income," which is the amount left after covering necessary living expenses like housing, food, and transportation. This process allows debtors to catch up on payments for secured assets like homes and cars while maintaining a basic standard of living, offering a structured path to financial stability.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has turned down three takeover offers from Paramount, with the latest bid valued at just under $24 per share and consisting of 80% cash.

          <p>A Pakistani naval vessel, in a multi-national operation, has intercepted two sailboats in the Arabian Sea, seizing narcotics with an estimated value of nearly one billion dollars. The seizure, confirmed by U.S. Central Command, included several tons of crystal methamphetamine and a smaller quantity of cocaine. The operation was part of the ongoing efforts by the Combined Maritime Forces, a 47-nation naval partnership that patrols key shipping lanes to disrupt the trafficking of drugs and weapons. The intercepted vessels were stateless, and the confiscated narcotics were destroyed.</p>

          <p>Following massive "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration, organizers from groups like Indivisible and the ACLU are planning the movement's next phase. The strategy is to evolve beyond single-day protests into a sustained, multi-faceted resistance, including coordinated rapid responses to government overreach, targeted economic boycotts, and local organizing efforts. Leaders emphasize the need to build on the protest's momentum by channeling energy into concrete actions that challenge the administration's policies and support democratic institutions, with some groups exploring a future general strike.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix's stock price declined after the company reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, a miss it attributed to an unexpected expense from a tax dispute in Brazil. Despite the earnings miss, the streaming giant's revenue grew by 17%, meeting forecasts, driven by strong membership growth and increased advertising sales. The company projects continued strong revenue growth for the fourth quarter and noted that its ad-supported tier had its best sales quarter ever, though the tax issue led to a downward revision of its full-year operating margin forecast.
