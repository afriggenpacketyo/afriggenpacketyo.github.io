          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card credit card program from Goldman Sachs. According to sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan has emerged as the leading contender after other potential buyers like American Express and Barclays stepped aside. If finalized, the deal would transfer the prominent co-branded credit card portfolio to the largest card issuer in the United States. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have declined to comment on the ongoing discussions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, fueled by a jump in sales after delivering the most aircraft since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year" for the manufacturer, which has faced numerous crises. The company's adjusted loss per share was better than analysts expected, and it reduced its cash burn substantially compared to the previous year. While challenges remain, including delays in certifying the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models, the improved performance suggests progress in stabilizing production and operations.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new initiative called "Green Apron Service" to refocus on customer hospitality and improve its in-store experience. The strategy is part of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan to boost sluggish sales by fostering warmer, more engaging interactions between baristas and customers. This program involves better staffing, improved technology like a "Smart Queue" system, and a renewed emphasis on personal connection to make Starbucks visits a regular habit. The company hopes this focus on service will help it stand out in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>With a record number of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) maturing, savers face the decision of what to do with their funds as interest rates have slightly declined. Experts advise against passively allowing CDs to auto-renew, as savers might be locked into a less favorable rate. Instead, they recommend proactively comparing options, such as opening a new CD with a different term or at a different bank, or moving the money into a more liquid high-yield savings account. Locking in a still-high CD rate now could be a smart move before potential future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast, Citing Eased Tariffs and Import Surges</h2>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, predicting a 3% expansion in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. The revision is partly attributed to the softening of some U.S. tariffs and a recent surge in U.S. imports as companies rushed to get ahead of new taxes, a practice known as "front-loading." While this activity provided a short-term boost, the IMF warns that higher tariffs and continued economic uncertainty could still lead to weaker growth in the long run. The report highlights the delicate balance of global trade dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found compelling evidence of a female-centered society in the 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey. DNA analysis of skeletons buried under homes revealed that residents were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This modern genetic analysis confirms long-held archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The findings provide a rare glimpse into a prehistoric social structure where women held an elevated status, challenging common assumptions about ancient patriarchal societies.</p>

          <p>India, home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its tiger population grow to over 3,600. However, conservationists warn that this success is threatened by increasing habitat fragmentation. Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure projects are dividing forests into smaller, isolated patches, which affects the tigers' movement, breeding, and access to prey. Experts emphasize that protecting these animals requires not just increasing their numbers but also preserving large, high-quality, and interconnected ecosystems to ensure their long-term survival.</p>

These include phrases like "you can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it" and "big kids don't cry," which can create unrealistic expectations or suppress healthy emotional expression. The article suggests that such statements can harm a child's long-term well-being and relationships.

          <p>A lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day workweek has identified three key strategies for success. These include implementing productivity hacks like shortening or eliminating meetings, re-engineering work processes for greater efficiency, and critically evaluating and eliminating low-impact tasks. Companies that adopted these methods reported positive outcomes, including reduced employee burnout, higher engagement, and boosted profits. The findings suggest that a shorter workweek is achievable and beneficial when organizations become more intentional about how time is used.</p>
