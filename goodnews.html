The initiative, which will be rolled out nationwide by 2026, educates children as young as five on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen. Health experts emphasize that childhood sunburn significantly increases melanoma risk later in life, and this preventative education aims to improve public health for the next generation.</p>
