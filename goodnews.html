          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," with writer Harlan Coben, centering the story on a skilled female surgeon rather than her sex appeal. Witherspoon explains that her upbringing watching James Bond films, where she questioned the roles of women, inspired her to create characters with unique skill sets. Through her production company, Hello Sunshine, she continues to champion complex female-led stories, addressing what she sees as a persistent gap in Hollywood for such narratives.</p>

          <p>Apple and Formula 1 have finalized a five-year media rights agreement, making Apple TV the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all F1 events starting in 2026. The deal, valued at approximately $140 million per year, will include all practice, qualifying, and race sessions within the standard Apple TV subscription, replacing the current deal with ESPN. This move reflects Apple's strategy of acquiring exclusive sports rights to control the user experience and expand its live content offerings, building on its recent success with an F1-themed movie.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has appointed former Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe to a seat on the powerful Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinizes government spending. Lowe, who was ousted from Reform UK after a dispute with its leadership, stated he will use the position to ask tough questions about how taxpayer money is spent. The move has drawn criticism from Labour, but the Conservatives defended the appointment, stating Lowe shares their values on cutting waste and that they will work cross-party in the national interest.</p>

          <p>The conventional 60/40 investment portfolio of stocks and bonds is facing challenges as investors increasingly turn to alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency for diversification. Some strategists now advocate for a 60/20/20 model, allocating 20% to assets like precious metals and bitcoin to hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. This shift is highlighted by gold reaching record highs and substantial inflows into gold-backed ETFs, suggesting a growing acceptance of these assets as core portfolio holdings.

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, is reportedly planning to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously indicated he would wait for Pelosi to retire, his decision to enter the race was apparently spurred by the entry of another progressive candidate. Pelosi, who is 85 and has not announced her plans for re-election, is currently focused on a California ballot measure to redraw congressional districts in favor of Democrats.</p>

          <p>This article explains that making payments to a debt collector does not automatically protect a consumer from being sued for the outstanding balance. Unless a formal written agreement explicitly states that legal action will be withheld, collectors may still file a lawsuit to secure a judgment, which enables stronger collection methods like wage garnishment. To minimize legal risk, consumers are advised to get all payment plans in writing, adhere strictly to the terms, and understand their rights under state and federal consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>A cultural shift is underway in the bodybuilding community, moving away from traditional "dirty bulking"—consuming massive calories from any source—to a more moderate "lean bulking" approach. This newer method involves a slight caloric surplus from healthy foods, aiming to build muscle more sustainably without accumulating excessive fat. The trend reflects both updated exercise science, which shows extreme calorie surpluses are unnecessary, and a broader cultural desire to maintain a lean, athletic physique year-round rather than cycling through bulking and cutting phases.</p>

          <p>With gold and silver prices reaching record highs, this article offers guidance for investors looking to enter the precious metals market safely.
