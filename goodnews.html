Services like InstaHeadshots and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for under $50, which some users claim has significantly increased inbound messages from recruiters. However, this trend raises ethical questions about authenticity, with career experts warning that poorly executed AI photos can appear inauthentic and harm a candidate's prospects.

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the prestigious Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that the event has been held outside of Japan. The tournament features over 44 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in a specially constructed ring made from 11 tons of clay shipped from Japan. This rare event highlights the deep cultural and religious traditions of sumo, which is interwoven with Shinto rituals, presenting a unique challenge in recreating its authentic atmosphere for a Western audience. The five-day competition brings a significant piece of Japanese heritage to an international stage.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles-based group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth is creating a vital space for Black men to discuss their mental well-being, challenging societal pressures and stigmas. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings offer a supportive environment where men can be vulnerable without judgment, addressing a critical need as suicide rates among Black men have risen. The initiative comes at a time when Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often face substandard care due to systemic disparities. The group aims to break generational cycles and foster emotional expression, providing a gateway to therapy and community healing.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who graduated debt-free after winning 30 scholarships, advises prospective college students on common pitfalls in the application process. She emphasizes that a major mistake is applying only for large, national scholarships with immense competition. Instead, she recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships that have narrower criteria, which significantly reduces the applicant pool. Greene also stresses the importance of persistence, noting that she applied for over 100 scholarships to win 30, and suggests treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince committees to invest in one's education.</p>

          <p>The phrase "Das crazy," a blend of German and English, has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The term, which humorously breaks grammatical rules, is widely used by young people in internet culture and social media to express surprise, speechlessness, or to keep a conversation going. Its selection highlights the significant influence of the English language and the trend towards brevity in modern youth slang.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media until at least age 16 contributes to better mental health and future success. She recommends that parents begin educating their children about responsible technology use by late elementary school, years before they receive a device. Key strategies include setting firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight, and teaching children about online privacy and the value of their time away from screens. By establishing these foundations early, parents can help their children develop a healthier, more moderate relationship with technology as they grow older.</p>

After testing his prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, he successfully pitched his initial run of 200 coats to luxury stores.

The second category, which includes gold, consists of assets that don't produce anything and rely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them later. Buffett prefers the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses that generate tangible value and returns, which can be rationally calculated and assessed based on their output.

          <p>Gen Z women in the United States represent one of the most left-leaning demographics in modern history, a stark contrast to their male counterparts whose political views are more aligned with the national average.

Many in this demographic express disillusionment with both the Democratic and Republican parties, viewing them as beholden to corporate interests and failing to address their material concerns. This sentiment has led many to identify as "leftist" or "anti-capitalist" rather than liberal or Democrat.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who have been divorced tend to marry again. The study shows that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarriage often leads to improved financial stability. The median household wealth for remarried adults was found to be significantly higher than that of divorced, single adults, and comparable to those in their first marriage. This data suggests that despite the decline in the overall divorce rate, remarriage remains a common and often economically beneficial path for a large portion of the U.S. population.</p>
