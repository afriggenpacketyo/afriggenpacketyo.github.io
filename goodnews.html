          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 800 American jobs. A company executive stated that while the move aligns with a long-term strategy to build products closer to consumers, the tariff environment under the Trump administration accelerated the decision. The new plant is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production. The company is hiring for roles in engineering, research and development, and supply chain management.</p>

          <p>A London court has affirmed the legality of same-sex civil partnerships in the Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory, in a ruling seen as a victory for LGBTQ+ rights. The Privy Council rejected an appeal that challenged the governor's authority to enact the law in 2020 after local lawmakers had voted against it. The case originated from a legal challenge by a lesbian couple who were denied a marriage license. Activists believe this decision could set a positive precedent for other British overseas territories where similar legal battles for LGBTQ+ rights are ongoing.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. The decision came after Emmett paid $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment over unpaid compensation and health benefits owed to four writers from a collapsed 2019 television project. Emmett's former production company, Emmett/Furla Oasis, was responsible for the debt, but he stated he paid it personally because it was "the right thing to do." The resolution clears a significant hurdle for his current company, which is developing a film with Martin Scorsese.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies "front-loading" inventory by importing goods before the tariffs took effect, thus delaying price hikes for consumers. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial costs and waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy before raising prices. The use of bonded warehouses and various tariff exemptions has also resulted in effective duty rates being lower than the officially announced figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to lift certain financial sanctions on Syria, a move the White House says is intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad.

The decision follows a meeting between Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that sanctions were hindering his transitional government.
