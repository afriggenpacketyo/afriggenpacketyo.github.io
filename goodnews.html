          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The Justice Department revealed that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with over $2 billion in assets between 2014 and 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, violating a prior 2014 plea agreement. Whistleblowers provided detailed evidence, including names and documents, leading to the settlement and underscoring the importance of cooperation in ongoing investigations.</p>
