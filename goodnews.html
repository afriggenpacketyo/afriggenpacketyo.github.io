          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 20:29:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered that applying a mild electrical current to food waste can significantly boost the microbial process that breaks it down, yielding higher quantities of valuable industrial chemicals like acetone and butanol. This electrofermentation process was tested on sour cream and ice cream waste, showing it could generate up to 12 times more butanol at lower voltages. The innovation presents a dual benefit: reducing landfill waste, which accounts for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, and creating a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemicals. This could also offer economic advantages by turning a costly waste problem into a profitable resource.</p>

          <p>People with terminal illnesses are increasingly creating personal music playlists to aid in their end-of-life care, a practice recognized for its therapeutic benefits. Music has been shown to light up multiple parts of the brain, helping to reduce anxiety and connect individuals to their memories and loved ones, even when unresponsive. Charities like Marie Curie highlight how shared music can create a sense of normality and closeness for families during palliative care. Experts note that hearing is one of the last senses to fade, allowing music to provide comfort to the dying and later serve as a meaningful connection for grieving family members.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the rates to remain unchanged, following the central bank's recent decision to hold a key interest rate steady. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains. The positive sentiment was supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, which pushed the Dow Jones and S&P 500 to new record highs on Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia officially recognized a Palestinian state, aiming to build momentum for a two-state solution. The leaders stated the decision is intended to revive hope for peace and is not a reward for Hamas, which can have no future role in governance. The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established. This symbolic but historic decision marks a significant shift in policy for key Western nations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than just teaching manners, these parents validate their child's feelings and treat mistakes as learning opportunities. By listening more than lecturing and allowing children to resolve their own conflicts, parents create an environment of emotional safety that builds a strong foundation for healthy relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has affirmed that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address the rising costs of benefits and provide better support for recipients. The government plans to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits to help them return to work. This commitment comes after the government scrapped a controversial policy that would have cut disability benefits. With the health and disability benefits bill projected to reach £100 billion by 2030, McFadden emphasized the current system is unhealthy for individuals and fiscally unsustainable long-term.</p>

          <p>On Nantucket, an island with a high incidence of Lyme disease, scientists are developing a groundbreaking project to genetically engineer wild white-footed mice to be immune to the illness. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" initiative aims to break the transmission cycle, as mice are the primary carriers of the Lyme-causing bacteria that infects ticks. By introducing a gene for a Lyme-preventing antibody into mouse embryos, the team has created heritably immune lab mice. The project is proceeding with extensive community consultation to address ecological concerns before any potential release of engineered mice into the wild.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has launched with an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the "fearless pursuit of truth" and open debate. Founded by figures like historian Niall Ferguson and journalist Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of ideological diversity they see on other campuses. UATX offers a curriculum based in Western civilization, small seminar-style classes, and currently, free tuition funded by nearly $200 million in private donations.

          <p>Each year, a special "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes a mysterious and arduous 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. Unlike other monarchs that live for about a month, this generation can live up to nine times longer, allowing them to complete the journey. Scientists are still studying how these insects navigate to the same location over multiple generations. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in 30 years due to threats like illegal logging and the loss of milkweed plants, their primary food source, prompting conservation efforts like Monarch Watch to protect their habitat.</p>

          <p>Apple has redesigned its custom chips for the new iPhone lineup, signaling a major focus on artificial intelligence by integrating neural accelerators directly into its A19 Pro GPU cores. This architectural shift aims to make the iPhone the premier device for running on-device AI workloads efficiently and privately. In a significant move toward vertical integration, Apple also introduced its first custom wireless chip (N1) and a second-generation modem (C1X), reducing its reliance on suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. This gives Apple unprecedented control over its core hardware, enabling enhanced performance, better power efficiency, and a more seamless user experience.</p>

          <p>An analysis highlights three growth stocks—Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana—that have generated substantial returns for investors since the beginning of 2023. These companies, which were unprofitable just a few years ago, have successfully turned their financials around, driven by factors like the adoption of AI and effective business restructuring. The article notes that while their performance has been remarkable, their current valuations are high, suggesting potential risks alongside their growth. A hypothetical combined investment of $21,000 across these stocks would now be worth over $1.1 million. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in a deal to prevent a ban on the app. The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, which would place the popular social media platform under the control of prominent American investors.</p>

He followed this in the ninth with a leaping grab at the wall to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez.

In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang is reportedly producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing their "degree of mutual trust."
