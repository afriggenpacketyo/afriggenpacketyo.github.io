          <p>Verizon customers across the United States reported significant service outages on Saturday, with many phones being limited to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service for some customers and stated its engineers were working quickly to resolve it. Reports on social media and outage-tracking site DownDetector showed issues spanning from California to Florida, peaking with nearly 23,000 reports in the afternoon. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company experienced in October 2024.</p>

          <h2>AI Identifies Common Stock Market Myth That Investing is Akin to Gambling</h2>

          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT revealed that the most common myth about the stock market is that it is equivalent to gambling. The article explores this misconception, noting that while short-term market volatility can feel random, long-term investing is fundamentally different. Unlike gambling, which is based on chance, investing involves owning parts of real companies, and returns are tied to performance and economic forces. The article contrasts the two, emphasizing that disciplined, research-based investing in diversified portfolios has historically been a method for wealth creation, not a zero-sum game of luck.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England indicates a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and attendance throughout the rest of the year. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who were partially absent in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize getting children in from the very start of the new term to combat ongoing attendance challenges.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not be running for reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official familiar with her decision. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran. Her departure will open up a key Senate seat, and Representative Ashley Hinson is reportedly planning to announce her candidacy for the position. Ernst's decision sets the stage for what is expected to be a competitive race, though Democrats have not won a U.S. Senate race in Iowa since 2008.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations. Amid global dysfunction and paralysis within institutions like the United Nations, Indonesia's status as a non-aligned economic power allows it to act as a bridge between competing ideologies. The article posits that Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a model for a new world order that prioritizes cooperation and practical action over confrontation. This approach is presented as a potential roadmap for navigating complex global challenges.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a proposal from a local hotel to silence the town clock's chimes between midnight and 7 a.m. The Wynnstay Hotel's owner argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, has led to regular complaints from guests. However, councillors rejected the request, stating that the sounds from the recently restored 150-year-old clock are part of the town's character. The decision highlights a local conflict between preserving historical ambiance and accommodating modern tourism and business needs.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Powys, organized a rescue effort to save thousands of fish that were stranded in a dwindling pool of water after a local brook dried up due to prolonged dry weather. A local man, Dave Lister, discovered the fish "gasping for air" and, after not receiving an urgent response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), rallied friends to help move them to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the residents felt they had to act to prevent the fish from dying.</p>
