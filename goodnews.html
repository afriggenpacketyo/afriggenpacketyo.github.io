          <p>British luxury fashion house Burberry is set to re-enter the U.K.'s prestigious FTSE 100 index after a one-year absence, according to index provider FTSE Russell. This promotion follows a period of strategic overhaul under CEO Joshua Schulman, which has seen the brand regain significant market traction. The change, part of a quarterly reshuffling at the London Stock Exchange, will see Burberry replace homebuilder Taylor Wimpey and student accommodation firm Unite Group in the blue-chip index later this month.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld an Illinois law that prohibits carrying firearms on public transit systems like buses and trains. The court reversed a lower court's decision, ruling that the decade-old restriction is constitutional and consistent with the historical tradition of regulating firearms in sensitive and crowded public spaces. The majority opinion stated that while the Second Amendment protects self-defense, it does not prevent lawmakers from enacting such safety measures to keep public transport free from accessible guns.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary, John Healey, has affirmed that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine with security guarantees before any peace negotiations and to secure any eventual deal. Speaking ahead of a meeting in Paris, he stated the coalition would help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once peace is achieved. This commitment comes as Russia's President Putin continues to convey a defiant stance on the war, though Healey suggested Russia is feeling the pressure from sustained international support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he remains dedicated to achieving a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, acknowledging that while the parties are "not ready yet," he is optimistic that a resolution will be reached. He described his approach as patient and transactional, aiming to bring both leaders into a room to broker a deal directly, a method he claims has been successful in de-escalating other global conflicts. His comments follow continued Russian attacks on Ukraine and a recent meeting between the leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea.</p>

This makes the upcoming Saturday drawing for the third-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history, with a potential cash value of approximately $770.3 million before taxes. The current run of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record, fueling ticket sales and increasing the possibility that the final prize amount could grow even larger.</p>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public has a more flexible and nuanced perspective on its country's rivalry with the United States than is often assumed. While optimistic about China's future, nearly half of the respondents expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" with the U.S., implying an acceptance of peaceful coexistence rather than a desire for outright global dominance. The findings suggest potential avenues for reducing tensions, though researchers caution that self-censorship may have influenced some responses.</p>

While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, she concluded the government's true motive was a targeted, ideologically-driven attack, a ruling the White House has vowed to appeal.</p>
