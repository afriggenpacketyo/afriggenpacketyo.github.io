          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 12:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, allowing millions more households to receive £150 off their energy bills this winter. The changes remove property size and energy score qualifications, extending the discount to 2.7 million more homes, including those with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills to offset the cost. The government also plans to expand automatic compensation schemes for energy customers, including those experiencing long hold times or unexpectedly high bills. The goal is to improve energy efficiency and reduce heating costs for vulnerable households (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in London, leading to the declaration of a heatwave in Suffolk. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England, with warnings of potential strain on health and social care services. Temperatures are expected to rise further, potentially reaching 33C, with regional fire services issuing water safety warnings and health organizations advising precautions for vulnerable individuals. A change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler temperatures and break the heatwave. The current high temperatures are due to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by reflecting on the potential role of quilts in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to guide their escape to the North. These quilts, displayed publicly, contained patterns that conveyed information about safe houses, routes, and necessary preparations. While some historians debate the lack of written evidence, Edmunds believes the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad would explain the absence of documentation. Edmunds continues to quilt, honoring her ancestors and sharing the stories of those who sought freedom.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, is a common offering at Thai spirit houses in Los Angeles, reflecting a blend of animistic and Brahmanic beliefs integrated into Buddhist practices. The red soda is believed to have replaced blood offerings to appease spirits, particularly Kuman Thong, the spirit of a deceased boy. Red Fanta's popularity is likely linked to Coca-Cola's long-standing presence in Thailand, with the drink serving as a sweet offering to gain favor with the spirits. Spirit houses, found outside Thai establishments, serve as a place for spirits to dwell and receive offerings.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for assessing oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning oil and gas, not just production emissions. This guidance will affect decisions on controversial projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw, though it does not guarantee approval. Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely impact the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels. Energy Minister Michael Shanks stated the guidance offers clarity for the North Sea oil and gas industry, while climate groups stress the incompatibility of new projects with climate commitments.</p>
