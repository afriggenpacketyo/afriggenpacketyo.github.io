          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, continues to make strides toward his pitching comeback after undergoing right elbow surgery in September 2023. During a simulated game, Ohtani struck out six batters in three innings, throwing 44 pitches at Petco Park. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hinted at the possibility of Ohtani returning as a pitcher before the All-Star break, although he emphasized the importance of patience in the process. Ohtani's performance included a fastball clocked at 96 miles per hour, showcasing his command and control over various pitches. The pitching coach, Mark Prior, expressed satisfaction with Ohtani's progress, noting his ability to execute any pitch at will, suggesting a promising return to the mound for the reigning National League MVP.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level trade talks in London, officials from the U.S. and China have reached an agreement on a framework to implement the Geneva consensus. The deal, which aims to stabilize the strained relationship between the two countries, now awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement, which seeks to address violations of the Geneva trade agreement. Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noted that while the agreement signals a commitment to de-escalate tensions, the path to concrete breakthroughs remains uncertain. If approved by both leaders, the framework could lead to the rollback of certain tariffs and measures imposed earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial, which began in April, is nearing its end as the defense called Dr. Andrew Rentschler, an expert on biomechanics, as their final witness. Read is accused of backing her Lexus into Boston police officer John O'Keefe and leaving him to die in a blizzard in January 2022. Rentschler's testimony aimed to challenge the prosecution's claim that the damage to O'Keefe's clothing and Read's SUV was consistent with a collision. Rentschler testified that a 15 mph collision between a crash dummy's head and a taillight like Read's wouldn't have resulted in a skull fracture. Read has announced that she will not testify in her own defense.</p>

          <p>Mikie Sherrill, a U.S. Representative, has won the Democratic primary in New Jersey's race for governor, defeating a crowded field of experienced rivals. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, will face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election. Her campaign focused on making the state more affordable and highlighted her background as a Navy veteran and prosecutor. A win in November would make her the second female governor of New Jersey.</p>
