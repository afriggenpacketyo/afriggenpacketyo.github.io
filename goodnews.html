          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to largely positive reviews, with some critics calling it a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own career. The film, which also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, is already generating awards season buzz for its crowd-pleasing yet subtle examination of identity and fame.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds suggests that this Labor Day weekend is an opportune time for consumers to lease electric vehicles. A significant $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs. With EV prices declining and leasing becoming the dominant way consumers acquire these vehicles, the expiring credit offers substantial savings. The IRS has also clarified that eligibility is tied to the contract date, not the delivery date, giving buyers more flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, without the approval of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. The judge stated that Lake's attempts to remove Abramowitz were a clear violation of statutory requirements designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. This ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to dismantle the agency, which has seen its operations drastically reduced under her leadership.</p>

While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that targeted, data-driven operations are needed to address community concerns. The move is also seen as a pushback against President Trump's narrative about crime in blue states and his threats to use military forces for local law enforcement.</p>
