          <p>Derrick Groves, the final escapee from a New Orleans jailbreak in May, has been apprehended in Atlanta after a five-month manhunt. Federal law enforcement, acting on a Crime Stoppers tip, located Groves hiding within a reinforced crawl space in an Atlanta home. Groves, convicted of a 2018 double murder, was believed to be a ringleader in the May 16 escape from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, an event that exposed significant design flaws and security failures. His capture, achieved without injury or resistance, successfully concludes the extensive multi-agency investigation to return all ten escapees to custody, with Groves now facing additional charges related to the escape and expected extradition to Louisiana. The operation highlights the persistence of law enforcement and the importance of public engagement in fugitive cases.</p>

          <p>The Palace Museum, established in Beijing's Forbidden City in 1925, is celebrating its centenary, now existing across four locations including Taipei and Hong Kong. A significant and dramatic aspect of this article's history involves the perilous 10,000-mile wartime trek of 20,000 crates of priceless relics between 1933 and 1950. This monumental effort saw the treasures travel through battle-ravaged cities to China's western hinterland, safeguarding an invaluable part of the nation's cultural heritage from destruction. However, the collection remains physically divided between Beijing and Taipei's National Palace Museum, a split seen by some as a continuing barometer of political tensions across the Taiwan Strait, even as all museums mark this major milestone.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that officials are "very close to a deal" to end the war in Gaza, following a third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt. Palestinian officials reported significant progress on prisoner-exchange lists and guarantees to prevent a return to fighting, with Hamas agreeing to release all Israeli hostages while delaying the handover of bodies. The negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, center on a 20-point peace plan proposed by Trump, which includes a ceasefire and Israeli troop withdrawals. Despite acknowledged "deep gaps" in interpreting the plan's details, particularly regarding troop withdrawal maps and exchange timetables, a cautious optimism for a breakthrough is noted among participants.</p>

The legislation mandates the state's Department of Public Health to identify these prohibited items by 2028, initiating a major overhaul of school cafeteria offerings. This article is driven by scientific studies linking ultra-processed foods to significant health issues in children, such as obesity and asthma, and aims to address the addictive behaviors triggered by high levels of refined carbohydrates, fats, and artificial additives.

          <p>Chelsea Women drew 1-1 with Twente in their Champions League opener, a result former England forward Lianne Sanderson called underwhelming and likely to prompt "questions" for manager Sonia Bompastor.

While Chelsea dominated possession and shots, they converted only one of six attempts on target.

Lead singer Marcel Campos often speaks to the experience of being "ni de aquí, ni de allá," reflecting their dual cultural identity. Despite dreams of a "Spaghetti Empire," members work multiple jobs to support their families in high-cost California, yet their performances offer a powerful escape for their Latino audience.</p>
