          <p>In an inflationary economy, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to grow savings, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. CDs allow savers to lock in high interest rates for a fixed term and are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01% APY, competitive online banks are offering rates well over 4.00% for various terms. To secure the best rates, experts recommend exploring online banks, which have lower overhead, and considering shorter-term CDs, as they currently offer higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals facing tax debt must decide whether to handle the resolution process themselves or hire a professional, a choice that depends on the complexity and amount of the debt. For relatively simple cases with debt under $10,000, a do-it-yourself approach, such as setting up an online IRS payment plan, can be sufficient. However, for larger debts, complex situations like unfiled returns, or if the IRS has initiated collection actions, enlisting a tax professional is highly recommended. Experts warn against ignoring the debt, which can lead to severe consequences like liens and levies, and advise being cautious of firms that guarantee specific outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key consideration, with national averages for a 30-year mortgage hovering around 6.80%. While rates are higher than in recent years, securing a favorable loan is still possible, especially for applicants with strong credit profiles in the mid-to-high 700s. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers. To get the best rate, it is crucial to improve one's credit score, pay bills on time, and shop around to compare offers from multiple lenders, as terms and fees can vary significantly.

          <p>Building an emergency fund is crucial, and a savings account offers a safe, interest-earning option for storing it. While the national average interest rate for standard savings accounts is low, high-yield savings accounts provide significantly better returns, with top rates currently exceeding 4.00% APY. These higher rates are typically offered by online banks, which have lower operational costs and can pass the savings to customers with minimal fees and low opening deposit requirements. To maximize earnings, savers should compare various high-yield accounts, considering not just the interest rate but also any associated fees that could impact their returns.

          <p>Gold remains a popular safe-haven asset, historically holding its value during periods of economic uncertainty and acting as a hedge against inflation. As of early July 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,325 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The price is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, overall economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, movements in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks regarding their gold reserves can also significantly impact its market price.

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced its expansion into Canada, where it will offer a generic version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. This move is possible because Novo Nordisk's patent on the drug is set to expire in Canada in January, opening the market to more affordable generic alternatives. Hims & Hers aims to capitalize on the growing demand for weight-loss treatments by providing a lower-cost option. The announcement follows Novo Nordisk's decision to end its collaboration with Hims & Hers in the U.S. over concerns about the promotion of compounded drug versions.</p>

Li Chunlin, a vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, emphasized that maintaining a certain level of investment is crucial for economic development and improving livelihoods. This approach comes amid speculation about how Beijing will navigate the U.S. tariff war. While massive investment has historically driven China's growth, such as the 2009-2010 stimulus, it has also led to concerns about rising debt levels, particularly from local government borrowing.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a groundbreaking "climate visa" program for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans each year to live, work, or study in Australia with a pathway to permanent residency, a response to the island's call for help. This "special mobility pathway" is distinct from traditional refugee status, as it proactively addresses climate-induced displacement with dignity, preserving the agency of those affected. Experts view this treaty as a potential model for other regions, offering a planned, cooperative approach to climate mobility rather than a reactive, post-disaster response.</p>

          <p>Small business owners facing financial headwinds and accumulating tax debt have several relief options available through the IRS to avoid severe consequences like frozen bank accounts or property liens. These programs include business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle debt for less than the full amount for businesses in serious financial hardship. Other options are Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status, which temporarily pauses collections, and penalty abatement for reducing or removing certain penalties.

          <p>The Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its national disaster plan in response to the growing threat of a major earthquake in the Nankai Trough. This action coincides with an unusual and intense earthquake swarm hitting the Tokara Islands, which has prompted some evacuations. The updated plan aims to reduce the projected death toll from a massive Nankai Trough quake by 80% over the next decade through infrastructure improvements like sea walls and refuge towers. However, the primary focus is on public education for rapid evacuation, as experts warn a tsunami could strike some coastal areas within just five minutes of a quake.</p>

          <p>A group of congressional Democrats is introducing a bill to establish a new, independent watchdog office to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The legislation would create an inspector general position tasked with rooting out fraud, waste, and misconduct within the White House, an area that currently lacks this form of direct oversight. Sponsors like Senator Adam Schiff argue the measure is a vital check on executive power that is long overdue, regardless of who is president, ensuring no administration is above the law. The move comes after years of criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest and ethics concerns within the Trump administration.</p>
