          <p>Keegan Bradley clinched the Travelers Championship by a single stroke, dashing Tommy Fleetwood's hopes for his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead going into the final round, faltered on the 18th hole with a missed par putt, opening the door for Bradley's birdie. Bradley, who will captain the USA at the Ryder Cup in September, seized the opportunity, securing his victory and leaving Fleetwood "gutted." Fleetwood reflected on the disappointing finish, lamenting the worst possible outcome after leading with three holes to play.</p>

          <p>Minjee Lee of Australia won the Women's PGA Championship, marking her third major title with a three-shot victory in Texas. Despite shooting a two-over-par 74 in the final round, Lee held off Auston Kim and Chanettee Wannasaen in windy conditions. The average score for the field was just over 75, the highest for any LPGA Tour major in a decade. Lee's victory adds to her previous major wins at the 2021 Evian Championship and the 2022 Women's US Open.</p>

          <p>Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), reflected on the bank's first decade, highlighting its role in addressing development challenges and supplementing the efforts of existing multilateral development banks. Established in 2016, AIIB has financed over US$60 billion in infrastructure projects across Asia and worldwide, including healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite massive infrastructure needs in Asian countries, estimated at trillions of dollars annually, Jin emphasized that no single MDB can fill the funding gap. AIIB aims to promote sustainable development in its member countries by filling this gap.</p>

          <h2>Government Unveils 10-Year Industrial Strategy Focused on Lowering Energy Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 17:33:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for UK businesses. The plan includes a British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme that will cut costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green levies. It also aims to speed up energy grid connections for new factories and projects. Prime Minister Starmer described the strategy as a "turning point" for the UK economy, supporting key industries and creating over one million new jobs. Conservative critics, however, argue the plan is an admission of the high costs of net zero, requiring taxpayer subsidies to prevent business failures.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz is now considered the "red-hot favorite" for Wimbledon after winning the Queen's title, according to former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash. Alcaraz beat Jiri Lehecka in the final at Queen's, claiming the crown for the second time and extending his winning streak to 18 matches. This fourth grass-court title means that Novak Djokovic is the only active player to have more titles on the surface than Alcaraz. Winning Queen's is seen as a good omen for Alcaraz, as he lifted the title in 2023 and then went on to triumph at Wimbledon.</p>
