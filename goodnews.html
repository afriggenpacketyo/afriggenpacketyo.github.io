          <h2>Lab-Grown Meat Faces Scrutiny Amid Environmental and Ethical Debates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 19:02:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The development of lab-grown meat, or cultivated meat, is being debated as a possible solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional meat production. While advocates claim it can meet growing meat demand with less environmental impact, critics argue that the environmental benefits are overstated and that reducing meat consumption should be prioritized. The process involves growing animal cells in vats, but questions remain about the energy intensity and overall climate cost compared to traditional farming. Despite regulatory approvals in some countries, mass production and affordability remain challenges, and some worry about the ultra-processed nature of cultivated food, as well as the environmental impact of the CO2 production in comparison to the methane gas produced by cows. Optimism surrounding the technology is tempered by the need for more comprehensive climate assessment studies and considerations of taste and affordability, which will ultimately decide its future.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are recovering as investors are no longer as concerned about the potential of Chinese startup DeepSeek to surpass current tech leaders. The market's initial panic in January, triggered by DeepSeek's release of an advanced AI model, led to a significant drop in AI stock values. Cramer argues that the recovery is a "refutation" of the idea that China had beaten the U.S. in the AI arms race. He also said that the recovery of many AI stocks shows that fears about DeepSeek's dominance are short-lived (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump is claiming a foreign policy victory after a ceasefire was established between Israel and Iran, with NATO boss Mark Rutte praising Trump's decisive action. However, intelligence officials have suggested that the U.S. bombing raid did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear research facilities, potentially setting the program back only by months. Questions remain about the extent of the damage to Iranian facilities, and the fragile nature of Middle East truces. Despite these uncertainties, Trump's critics have been proven unfounded, giving him political space to tout his administration's efforts as an unqualified success.</p>

          <p>The winning design for a memorial honoring Queen Elizabeth II in London will include a bridge with a jewel-like balustrade, reminiscent of her wedding tiara. Foster + Partners' design also features statues of the Queen and Prince Philip, along with gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom. The memorial, expected to cost around $62 million, is slated for formal announcement in April 2026, coinciding with what would have been the Queen's 100th birthday month. The publicly funded project has faced some criticism regarding its cost amid dwindling government funding for arts and culture in the UK.</p>

          <h2>Anthropic Wins Key AI Copyright Case, but Faces Trial Over Pirated Books</h2>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, has won a major legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that its use of legally purchased books to train its AI model did not violate copyright law. The judge found that the use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model (LLM) was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December over its use of millions of pirated books. The ruling sets an important precedent for similar disputes in the AI industry.</p>
