          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares surged over 8% after the company announced it would revert to its original, iconic logo, abandoning a controversial redesign. This decision followed widespread criticism from social media users, who labeled the new design 'generic' and 'soulless,' and even public comments from President Donald Trump, who urged the company to admit its mistake. The stock recovered losses incurred when the new logo was initially revealed, indicating strong customer and investor approval for the return to classic branding. This article highlights the significant influence of public opinion and political figures on corporate branding decisions and market performance.</p>
