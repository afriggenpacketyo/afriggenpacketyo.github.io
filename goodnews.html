          <h2>Child Development Expert Identifies Self-Connection as a Crucial Skill for Lifelong Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, teaching a child the skill of self-connection is non-negotiable for their future success. Self-connection is defined as the ability to understand one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article argues that common parenting habits, like dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently erode this connection over time. It suggests practical shifts, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help children build a strong sense of self and protect their long-term mental health.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. Using a $300-million investment fund, the initiative aims to use private capital to finance projects faster and at a lower cost than traditional models that rely on government grants and tax credits. Better Angels is currently bidding on several projects in Los Angeles, including a 212-unit development, and is already backing two smaller apartment buildings. The model seeks to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing market, aiming to address the housing crisis through capitalist principles.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces New Water Ombudsman to Address Consumer Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints regarding issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies, bringing the water industry in line with other utilities. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the sector, which has faced public outrage over rising bills and pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the industry as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030, signaling significant reforms are forthcoming.</p>

          <p>A new mural immortalizing the late Dodgers icon Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, nine months after his passing. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his iconic pitching motion and tipping his cap, celebrating his legacy and connection to the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked "Fernandomania" and became a cultural hero, bridging the gap between the team and its Latino fanbase. Fans at the stadium expressed deep emotional connections to the pitcher, remembering him as a symbol of hope and achievement.</p>
