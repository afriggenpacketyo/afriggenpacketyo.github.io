          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year, a significant event for the conservation of the vulnerable species. To improve the chances of survival, zoo experts distributed eggs laid by another penguin pair between the two nests. This instance highlights a behavior that is not uncommon in the penguin world and showcases the shared parenting duties within the species, contributing positively to the zoo's breeding program.</p>

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the team secured a deserved win, the match was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears in the first half after a knee injury. Gwinn has a history of two prior ACL injuries, casting significant doubt on her ability to continue in the tournament. The win was crucial, but the loss of their captain could be a major blow for the eight-time champions.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has identified five food categories he avoids giving to his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. The doctor also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends wholesome alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins.</p>

In less than a year since his debut, Smith is already being compared to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist for his ability to change a game from the number seven spot.

The market had been largely dormant since early 2022 due to economic pressures, creating a major liquidity backlog for startups and their investors.

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen." He argued that before America's independence, people were merely subjects ruled by others, and the Declaration of Independence set in motion centuries of global movements for equality and unalienable rights. Burns emphasized that the greatness of America comes from telling its complicated stories, including the struggles of marginalized groups who were not initially included but were inspired by the document's powerful words.</p>

          <p>A key provision in the newly passed federal budget package creates a tax deduction for tipped income, effectively eliminating the federal income tax burden on those earnings. The measure is aimed at workers in industries like hospitality, where tips constitute a significant portion of income. However, the specifics, including income caps for eligibility and the maximum deductible amount, vary between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-income workers who already have no federal tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>
