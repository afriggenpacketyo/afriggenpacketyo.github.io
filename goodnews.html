          <p>Aaron Judge tied Yankees legend Yogi Berra for fifth-most career home runs in Yankees history with his 358th career home run against the Chicago White Sox. Judge hit the milestone in his first at-bat of the game, driving a cutter to deep left-center field. Despite Judge's achievement, the Yankees lost to the White Sox, 3-2, but they still hold the first wild card slot in the American League. The Yankees are currently in a postseason race and are looking to secure a spot for home field advantage. Judge is considered one of the best hitters in MLB, and his performance is crucial for the Yankees' postseason hopes as they face the Houston Astros and Toronto Blue Jays.

          <p>China has significantly increased its shipbuilding capabilities, becoming the world's largest navy with 234 warships compared to the US Navy's 219. This expansion is fueled by China's economic growth and strategic ambitions in the South China Sea and beyond. The US Navy is struggling to keep pace with China's rapid naval development due to dwindling shipbuilding capacity. China's shipyards, including Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan, and Hudong-Zhonghua, have produced a substantial number of warships in recent years. China's naval buildup is driven by a desire to safeguard national security and prevent foreign assaults, with the country's commercial fleet and shipbuilding expertise playing a key role during crises. The article explores China's naval expansion and its implications for global maritime power dynamics. </p>
