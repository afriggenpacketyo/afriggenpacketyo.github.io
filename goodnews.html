          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing their stock prices to surge dramatically. This speculative activity focuses on heavily shorted and low-priced stocks, following a pattern similar to the 2021 GameStop mania. The surge in these "meme stocks" coincides with a broader market rally, as investors react positively to recent tariff news and strong economic data, fueling what some analysts are calling a "junk rally."

          <p>Vladimir Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square is seeing a new surge of visitors before it closes for extensive repairs scheduled to last until 2027. The preserved body of the Soviet Union's founder has been a public attraction since his death in 1924, though its popularity waned after the Soviet collapse. The upcoming closure has revived interest, with tourists and locals lining up for a final look at the historical curiosity, amid ongoing speculation that he might eventually be buried.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will begin using cane sugar in its U.S. products is being viewed as the latest victory for the politically powerful American sugar industry. The sector has long benefited from government policies like high tariffs that keep domestic prices inflated, and the Trump administration has expanded these supports. The move could significantly increase demand for sugar farmers, while potentially harming the rival corn syrup industry, a key agricultural sector in states that form part of Trump's political base.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her sexual attacker's tongue while defending herself. At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter one for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial, where prosecutors have apologized and asked the court to overturn her conviction, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

          <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken by Stanley Forman in 1975, capturing a young woman and a child falling from a collapsed fire escape, had a profound impact on public safety in Boston. The harrowing image, which showed 19-year-old Diana Bryant falling to her death, prompted the city to enact new regulations requiring fire escape safety certifications every five years. The incident and the widely published photo raised national awareness about the dangers of neglected fire escapes, leading to a ripple effect of improved safety standards across the country.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for conspiracy to defraud overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks, but always maintained that their actions were common practice and known to their superiors. The Supreme Court ruled their trials were unfair due to incorrect directions given to the jury, and the Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial, potentially opening the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

NORAD stated the activity is regular and not considered a threat, but it marks the latest in a series of such sightings in recent months amid heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>
