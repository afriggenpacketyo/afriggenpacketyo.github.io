        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Houston Texans star running back Joe Mixon is set to miss the first four games of the season after the team placed him on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury list due to an ankle injury sustained in the offseason. Mixon, who had a Pro Bowl season in 2024 with over 1,000 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns, will be ineligible to play until after the fourth regular season game. In anticipation of his absence, the Texans have acquired veteran Nick Chubb and drafted Woody Marks from USC. These players are expected to carry the workload, with the team hoping Mixon can return to contribute later in the year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is currently moving over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to weaken significantly over the next few days, posing no threat to land, as reported by the National Hurricane Center. Located about 485 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, Fernand has maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. It is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin. Forecasters predict it will become a post-tropical cyclone by Wednesday and dissipate on Thursday, remaining well over the open ocean. This offers relief to coastal areas during an active hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has reported a substantial decrease in serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival, with "far fewer" incidents compared to recent years. A total of 423 arrests were made over two days, including 46 for offensive weapons and 18 for sexual offenses, but only two stabbings occurred, neither resulting in serious injury, a marked improvement from previous carnivals. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward credited the use of live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search for preventing harm. While LFR remains a point of contention with civil liberty groups, police emphasize its effectiveness in targeting individuals intending to cause harm.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada Garcia, a prominent former co-founder of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, has pleaded guilty to federal charges in the U.S., including racketeering conspiracy and running a continuing criminal enterprise. Zambada, 77, publicly apologized for the extensive harm illegal drugs have inflicted upon people in the United States and Mexico, accepting responsibility for his actions. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the plea as a step towards eradicating drug cartels, affirming that Zambada will face life imprisonment. His arrest in July 2024 marked a significant capture, and he is scheduled for sentencing on January 13.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 16:39:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, clarified to CNBC that he is not in the market to purchase another railroad, despite recent speculation. He met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss enhanced cooperation for more efficient freight rail operations, aiming for mutual benefits without an acquisition. This announcement follows a new partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX for coast-to-coast services. The news led to a 5% drop in CSX shares and declines in other railroad stocks like Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, as the market reacted to the absence of a major takeover bid.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back electric vehicle (EV) incentives and a recent slowdown in US EV sales, Ford is making a significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for an affordable four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000. This ambitious move, with deliveries aimed for 2027, challenges the trend of pricier EVs and targets a segment often overlooked by US automakers. The article suggests that while US policy may try to reverse the EV transition, the global market, particularly in places like China and the EU, is rapidly accelerating towards electric, compelling manufacturers like Ford to adapt and innovate for future competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved significant box office success with a two-day sing-along theatrical re-release, generating an estimated $16 million to $20 million domestically. Despite this strong performance, industry analysts believe it's a one-off "eventizing" strategy rather than a shift in Netflix's core model of prioritizing streaming over extended theatrical runs. The company uses these limited releases primarily as marketing tools to boost subscriber engagement and awards contention, often striking unique deals with theaters. The film has already become the second-most watched English-language film on Netflix, with the theatrical buzz expected to further increase its streaming viewership.</p>

Experts like Jason Granet note Powell's cautious tone, indicating the door was "ajar" rather than "wide open." Concerns about inflation, a resilient economy, and the Fed's independence amidst political pressure contribute to uncertainty regarding the pace and impact of future easing.
