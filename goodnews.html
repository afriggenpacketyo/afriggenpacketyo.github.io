          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and China's international trade representative Li Chenggang both confirmed the agreement, which aims to stabilize the strained relationship between the two countries after accusations of Geneva trade agreement violations. The framework will now be presented to President Trump and President Xi for approval, signaling that some disagreements still require internal discussion, reflecting a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, though concrete agreements remain uncertain. Optimism remains cautious as both nations seek to de-escalate trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent survey found that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police on the streets in the past five years, a rate significantly higher than for Japanese citizens. Despite the crime rate being roughly the same for both groups, those with foreign appearances are disproportionately targeted.

The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that children are being forced indoors onto digital devices due to traffic, fear of crime, and unwelcoming public spaces. The commission is calling for a national Play Strategy for England and recommends updating planning policies to include children's input and protecting play at break times in schools.
