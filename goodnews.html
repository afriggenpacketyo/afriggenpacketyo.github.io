          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a distance similar to that between Taipei and Okinawa. Led by Professor He Chengbing, the team developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This breakthrough has significant implications for both civilian and military applications, especially in tasks where data corruption is unacceptable. The system overcomes challenges such as seawater scattering sound, Doppler shifts, and ambient noise to maintain zero-error transmission at long ranges.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain and debilitating swelling after contracting COVID-19, baffling his medical team. After numerous tests, Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens, preventing it from functioning properly. Open-heart surgery revealed Mauceri's heart was trapped in a thick shell of scar tissue, which was carefully removed by Dr. Eugene Grossi. Following the surgery, Mauceri made a remarkable recovery and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the added time in his life made possible by his doctors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders aimed at ushering in a nuclear renaissance in America by streamlining the testing of advanced reactor designs and constructing new nuclear reactors. The goal is to expand American nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050, leveraging DOE national laboratories and DOD to build reactors on federally owned land. The administration also seeks to lower regulatory burdens and shorten licensing timelines, while supporting the domestic nuclear industrial base across the fuel cycle. This initiative aims to unlock the potential of nuclear energy for energy dominance and national security.</p>

          <p>While the "defund the police" movement faced backlash, some cities like Milwaukee, Seattle, and Austin have seen lasting impacts from redirecting funds to social services. Milwaukee diverted money to affordable housing and youth programming, while Seattle created a third public safety department for mental health crises. Austin invested in homeless services, resulting in more sheltered than unsheltered individuals for the first time. Organizers say these changes, driven by Black and brown-led groups, spark conversations about city priorities and reimagine public safety, despite challenges and shifting public sentiment.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK workers continue to embrace remote work more than most global rivals, averaging 1.8 days a week of remote work. This trend is particularly prevalent in English-speaking countries, with hybrid working becoming the dominant model. Despite some companies enforcing strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels in the UK have remained stable since 2023. While younger workers show a preference for office environments, women and parents are more likely to resist full-time office requirements, with many willing to seek new employment for flexible arrangements.</p>
