        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA superstar LeBron James is set to make history by playing a record 23rd season in the league after exercising a $53 million player option to extend his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. His agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the decision, stating that the 40-year-old is focused on winning a fifth championship. James currently shares the record for most seasons played with Vince Carter. By returning, he is also positioned to break Robert Parish's all-time record for regular-season games played, needing just 51 more appearances to surpass the former Boston Celtics center's mark of 1,562 games.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old forward Cooper Flagg with the first overall pick in the NBA Draft, positioning him as the new cornerstone of the franchise. Flagg had a standout freshman year at Duke University, where he was the consensus college player of the year, averaging 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game while leading the team to the Final Four. He joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, signaling a new era for the team. The selection aims to help the organization move forward after trading former star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris claimed his third victory of the season at the Austrian Grand Prix, successfully fending off intense pressure from his teammate, Oscar Piastri. The win is a significant boost for Norris, cutting his championship deficit to Piastri and providing momentum ahead of his home race at Silverstone. The victory validates recent efforts by Norris and his team to address early-season performance issues, particularly a lack of front-axle feel in the car that had hindered his qualifying pace. After a challenging race in Canada, this clean and commanding performance marks a positive turn in his championship campaign.</p>

          <p>Speculation about Lionel Messi's future on the global stage has intensified after his Inter Miami team suffered a decisive 4-0 defeat to his former club, Paris St-Germain, in the Club World Cup. At 38 years old, the Argentine legend's contract with Inter Miami expires at the end of 2025, and it remains uncertain if he will participate in the 2026 World Cup. Despite the loss, Messi showed flashes of his enduring talent in a match watched by over 65,000 fans. The game marked the first time in his career he played against a former team, prompting reflections on his legacy and whether this was his final major international club appearance.</p>

          <p>Apple has achieved its first major blockbuster success with "F1 The Movie," which earned an estimated $55.6 million in its North American debut and $144 million globally. This marks the tech company's largest theatrical opening to date, a significant achievement for Apple Original Films after mixed results with previous releases. The film, starring Brad Pitt and produced by much of the team behind "Top Gun: Maverick," was distributed in partnership with Warner Bros. With a production budget exceeding $200 million, the movie still has a long way to go to be profitable, but its strong critical reviews and positive audience reception suggest sustained box office potential.</p>

          <h2>The Health Debate Over Seed Oils: Poison or Misunderstood Fat?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate surrounding the health effects of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, has gained prominence, fueled by claims from figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. that they are 'poisoning Americans.' These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids. While some critics link high consumption of these fats to inflammation and chronic diseases, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations disagree. They argue that when substituted for saturated fats, seed oils can lower LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, stating that the evidence does not support the widespread claims of their toxicity.</p>

          <p>Mexican boxing champion Kenia Enr√≠quez, tired of waiting for a world title unification fight, has signed an exclusive multi-fight contract with mixed martial arts organization Combate Global. Enr√≠quez, who holds interim titles with the World Boxing Council (WBC), accuses the organization of failing to provide her a deserved opportunity to fight for the absolute championship, suggesting promotional politics are to blame. Having already made a successful MMA debut in March, the 31-year-old is now redirecting her career toward a new discipline where she feels she has received more support and opportunity, aiming to become a world champion in MMA.</p>
