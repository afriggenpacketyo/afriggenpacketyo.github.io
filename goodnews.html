          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that an extension of the August 12 deadline for trade tariffs on Chinese goods is likely to be arranged during upcoming talks in Sweden. Bessent expressed a constructive outlook on U.S.-China trade relations, suggesting the discussions could also cover China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. The talks aim to build on previous agreements that lowered the high reciprocal tariffs imposed by both nations earlier in the year, signaling a move towards more stable trade negotiations.

          <p>Amid persistent inflation, this article outlines four key questions for seniors weighing a reverse mortgage as a funding source. It prompts homeowners to consider if it is the most intelligent way to borrow home equity compared to alternatives like HELOCs and if they can manage with existing funds. The piece also highlights the importance of re-evaluating financial goals for beneficiaries, as a reverse mortgage impacts inheritance, and deciding on the most suitable payment distribution method, such as a lump sum or monthly installments.

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, recently completed a visit to Beijing four years after the organization was sanctioned by China. The trip, made at the invitation of a leading Chinese think tank, suggests a possible easing of travel restrictions that have prevented Merics researchers from visiting the country. The development is seen as a positive step toward renewing engagement and dialogue between European and Chinese researchers, a move long advocated for by EU leaders.</p>

The suspension lifts a significant overhang on the company's stock, which had been underperforming due to concerns about its exposure to China and the broader trade tensions between the two countries.

          <p>A recently passed bill has created a new federal student loan repayment option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% and a minimum of $10 per month. The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years and provides some benefits, such as a monthly bill reduction for dependents. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP may become one of the few affordable choices for new borrowers.</p>
