          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants involved in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases. Tillis's opposition is likely to prevent Martin's nomination from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, signaled that Martin's nomination was in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's suggestion of Canada joining the U.S., emphasizing that Canada is "not for sale, ever." Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, which has caused strain in U.S.-Canada relations, already tense due to trade tariffs. Carney stressed the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two nations, focusing on trade and security talks conducted on Canada's terms. Trump, however, remained open to the idea of acquiring Canada despite Carney's rejection.</p>

          <p>J's Grocery, a Black-owned supermarket in Clarksdale, Mississippi, has reopened after renovations, now offering fresh produce through a collaboration with local farmers and organizations. The initiative aims to combat food insecurity in the primarily Black town by providing access to healthy options like collard greens, okra, and corn. The store also features a seated area with raised herb beds to encourage community gathering. This effort hopes to revitalize the neighborhood and promote locally-owned businesses by providing healthy food options in an area where residents have lacked access to fresh produce.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer and his allies are strategically recruiting candidates in traditionally Republican states to expand the Senate map and increase the chances of Democrats regaining a majority in 2026. Despite a challenging electoral landscape, Democrats are optimistic about their prospects due to President Trump's approval rating decline. The article notes that Democrats are actively seeking candidates who can appeal to voters in conservative areas, aiming to defy the historical trend of Senate races aligning with presidential voting patterns. Schumer has boldly predicted that Democrats will regain the Senate majority in 2027.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film titled Ocean, which he considers one of his most important works, emphasizing the ocean's role in combating climate change. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime and warns that time is running out to save it. It also shows graphic footage of the damage caused by bottom trawling and its contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the bleak outlook, Attenborough remains optimistic about the ocean's capacity to recover with global protection efforts.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy warns that U.S. onshore oil production is likely to decline due to the recent plunge in crude prices, potentially endangering the nation's energy security. This is due to recession fears fueled by President Trump's tariffs and increased supply from OPEC+ producers. While the company plans to reduce its oil-focused spending, it expects more total production on less spending, due to the company's capital-efficient operations. The firm is still committed to its three-year plan and believes that it can get back to completing and drilling these Harkey wells in months, not years.</p>

          <p>Efforts by the Trump administration to curb certain narratives about the nation's racial past are encountering pushback from cultural institutions and individuals committed to preserving Black history. While federal grants to the Whitney Plantation were initially rescinded and then restored, the Smithsonian Institution refuted claims of returning artifacts to comply with the president's orders. This New York Times article highlights that, despite the administration's efforts to rewrite history, many believe that after years of reckoning with the nation's racist past, it will be difficult to fully erase these narratives.</p>
