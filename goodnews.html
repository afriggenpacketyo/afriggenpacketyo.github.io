Starting pitcher Landon Knack delivered a strong performance, allowing only one run through six innings, while the team's depth shone through with contributions from Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim. With key pitchers expected to return from injury soon, the Dodgers are demonstrating the juggernaut potential they were expected to have all along, setting a high bar for their competitors.

          <p>The late George Wendt, known for his role as Norm Peterson on "Cheers," inadvertently played a role in John Boehner's early congressional campaign in 1990. During an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show," Wendt mistakenly conflated Boehner with another candidate embroiled in a sexual scandal, causing a stir in the political landscape. Despite the gaffe, Boehner went on to win the election and eventually became Speaker of the House. Boehner later recounted the incident on X, noting Wendt's apology and their subsequent conversation, remembering the actor fondly. The incident serves as a reminder of the unexpected ways in which pop culture and politics can intersect.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to urge the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred early Friday morning, leading to the closure of Weidkamp Road as beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible. Officials initially miscalculated the number of escaped bees, later correcting the tally with assistance from a beekeeper at the scene. By the following morning, most bees had returned to their hives, and the responsibility for their delivery was handed back to those in charge, with hive boxes recovered and restored to use. The incident was successfully resolved with minimal risk to the public.</p>

The New Shepard rocket soared from West Texas, providing passengers with several minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth before returning for a parachute-assisted landing. The international crew, including attorney Jaime Alem√°n, celebrated the experience as spiritual and moving, with one passenger exclaiming, "You guys, we did it!" Blue Origin has now launched 68 individuals into space since its first crewed flight in July 2021, solidifying its position in the sub-orbital tourism market.

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, the historic Rancho Palos Verdes sanctuary, is considering relocating to a new site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall due to ongoing landslides. The original chapel, a national historic landmark, was forced to disassemble after rapid land movement threatened the structure. Chapel leaders hope to secure the new site and raise funds to rebuild with a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, preserving the chapel's sweeping ocean views. The prospective location is outside the city's landslide zone, offering a more stable foundation for the rebuilt sanctuary, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr. The move could allow the chapel to continue its legacy.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is linked to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This adaptability reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional, as he tests limits but is generally willing to pull back. The author argues that Trump's recent recovery in poll numbers is due to his backtracks and recalibrations, as voters expect him to check himself and be checked by others. The dynamic interaction is key to his approval among an important group of voters. The piece offers an interesting perspective.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Invest in New Weapons Factories</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 19:56:19 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government plans to spend ¬£1.5 billion on at least six new munitions and explosives factories to strengthen its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. The initiative aims to create about 1,800 new jobs and support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. This investment follows warnings about depleted stockpiles and highlights the need for a robust domestic defense industry. The move comes after Defence Secretary John Healey stated that UK defense spending would increase to 3% of GDP by 2034, boosting the armed forces and creating jobs. The move will help to deter adversaries.</p>
