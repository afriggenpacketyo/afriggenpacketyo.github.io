        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation sets consumer protection guardrails and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars. Supporters believe this will bring stability and legitimacy to the digital currency market, potentially revolutionizing financial technology by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. The administration sees this as a significant step toward integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its regulations for a future dominated by tokenized assets. The rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the market for digital currencies gains momentum, fueled by both private sector innovation and supportive government policies. The adviser emphasized that while stablecoins offer a gateway to decentralized finance, they also create significant new regulatory hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, experienced a significant jump in after-hours trading after it was announced that the firm will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. This inclusion is a major milestone for the company and often leads to a stock rally as index-tracking funds are required to purchase its shares. Despite underperforming the market earlier this year, Block's addition reflects the growing prominence of technology and financial services companies within the benchmark index.

The agreement, reportedly backed by Turkey and Jordan, aims to de-escalate tensions in the volatile region. The announcement comes after Israel conducted strikes it claimed were to defend the Druze minority in southern Syria.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), medical experts have clarified the nature of this common condition. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to symptoms like swelling and aching. The White House physician described the president's case as benign and common for his age, with no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as compression, elevation, and exercise, with more advanced procedures available for severe cases.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has changed its internal practices to prevent its engineers located in China from providing technical support for the company's U.S. Department of Defense cloud contracts. The move addresses national security and cybersecurity concerns raised in a recent ProPublica report. The report detailed how Microsoft's Azure cloud services for the Pentagon were being supported by engineers in China, albeit supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the previous arrangement unacceptable, and Microsoft stated it is committed to providing the most secure services possible to the U.S. government.</p>

The warm and dry spring weather has created ideal conditions for social wasps to thrive. While many people dislike the insects, ecologists emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. The article advises the public on how to coexist with wasps, such as not swatting at them and using sweet liquids as a distraction away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical comedy in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play is a humorous and affectionate homage to the famous couple. The plot is loosely based on a tabloid story from 2004 about Coleen's allegedly discarded engagement ring. The show is presented as a deliberately over-the-top medieval caper, reflecting the local theatre's focus on creating original, crowd-pleasing comedies.</p>

          <p>This article recounts a remarkable event from 2005, when a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports from the time, three lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found by authorities. Wildlife experts speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, which could explain the pride's protective behavior.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a common gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a bacterial compound, leading to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. This breakthrough could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>
