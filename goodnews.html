          <p>UFC chief Dana White clashed with a reporter during a press conference for the highly anticipated super-fight between Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Terence Crawford, his first major boxing event since launching a Saudi-backed venture. The confrontation arose from questions regarding the Muhammad Ali Act, a US law designed to protect boxers' rights and prevent monopolies, which White is spearheading efforts to amend. Critics argue White's model could restrict fighters with exclusive contracts and reduce their share of revenue, sparking a debate about the future of boxing. The incident briefly overshadowed the fighters' traditional pre-bout declarations.</p>

          <p>A recent International Workplace Group survey reveals that Gen Z employees are actively driving artificial intelligence adoption in workplaces by coaching older colleagues on AI tool usage. Nearly two-thirds of younger employees provide hands-on guidance, fostering knowledge exchange and bridging generational divides, with half of all employees believing AI improves collaboration. Senior directors credit these partnerships with enabling focus on higher-value tasks and unlocking new business opportunities. The report indicates widespread embrace of AI's efficiency benefits, with 86% of employees reporting increased efficiency and an average saving of 55 minutes daily.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is beginning to challenge SpaceX's dominant Starlink in the burgeoning satellite internet market, recently securing its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue for 2027. Despite Starlink's significant lead in deployed satellites and existing airline partnerships, Kuiper's progress signals intensified competition for global connectivity. Amazon aims to deploy 3,236 satellites by 2029, relying on a mix of launch providers including Blue Origin and SpaceX itself, to meet regulatory deployment requirements. The expanding low Earth orbit satellite market is poised to connect billions currently without internet access and support future 6G communications. (not investment advice)</p>

Captain Leon Smith emphasizes respect for the opposition, acknowledging that upsets can occur in tennis, even with a strong favorite.

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage. Critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, argue it's a "one-size-fits-all mandate" that strips local authorities of control and could alter single-family communities. Support for the bill surged after amendments were added to include union hiring for certain projects.</p>
