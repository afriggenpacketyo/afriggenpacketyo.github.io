          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, had been on the run for nearly two weeks. He was apprehended 1.5 miles northwest of the Calico Rock prison after attempting to flee from officers. The escape occurred when Hardin impersonated a corrections officer, leading to an investigation into the security lapse that allowed him to leave the facility. Hardin was convicted in 2017 for the murder of James Appleton and the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher.</p>

Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, detailed a new hybrid storage system that combines analog and digital methods to protect their crypto assets. The family now splits their seed phrase into multiple sets, encrypts them, and stores them in different geographic locations across four continents. This decision was driven by concerns about the vulnerability of hardware wallets and the increasing frequency of attacks targeting crypto credentials. The family is prioritizing safety as they continue to manage their crypto through decentralized exchanges and algorithmic trading bots.</p>

Despite overall spending rising significantly compared to previous years, internal disputes persist over departmental allocations, particularly within the Home Office. The government aims to present a convincing narrative of economic rebuilding, emphasizing security, health, and investment in long-term projects. However, short-term spending money remains tight, and the review faces the challenge of balancing financial prudence with political imperatives.

These claims include assertions that windmills are harmful to whales, that they kill excessive numbers of birds, that wind turbine blades are not properly recycled, and that wind turbines provide inconsistent energy efficiency. The article presents scientific evidence and data to counter these claims, highlighting the relatively small impact of wind turbines on bird mortality compared to other factors and the ongoing efforts to improve turbine recycling processes. It also explains the efficiency and operational characteristics of modern wind turbines.

          <p>The article explores the financial strategy of drawing down a 401(k) to delay Social Security benefits, weighing the potential benefits against the opportunity costs. While delaying Social Security can increase monthly benefit checks, the decision must consider the potential growth of 401(k) investments. The opportunity cost of withdrawing from a 401(k) is the lost potential for compounded growth, which can surpass the Social Security boost. The decision to draw down a 401(k) should be based on individual financial circumstances, including the size of the nest egg and the expected investment returns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental assistance, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year maximum on rental aid. The Delaware program also requires recipients to work and provides financial support, such as interest-bearing savings accounts. While some argue that time limits encourage upward mobility and turnover, others worry about the consequences for those unable to secure affordable housing. The Delaware program's success is attributed to its combination of time limits, work requirements, and financial incentives. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering expanding the power to impose time limits and work requirements nationally.</p>

While rolling over funds into an IRA is an option, it can also come with higher investment fees.

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa's brief tenure as the Doctor on "Doctor Who" marked a significant departure from the show's previous direction, bringing a refreshing sense of queerness. As the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role, Gatwa's Doctor challenged traditional norms. His performance was characterized by emotional availability, a unique fashion sense, and a direct confrontation with racism. Gatwa's casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anyone. While his final episode had some shortcomings, Gatwa's contribution to "Doctor Who" is remembered for its bold innovation and embrace of diversity.</p>
