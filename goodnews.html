          <p>Brave Lupus Tokyo, led by former All Black Richie Mo'unga, secured their second consecutive Japan Rugby League One title with an 18-13 victory over the Kubota Spears. Mo'unga played a pivotal role, scoring the opening try and setting up another, while also contributing eight points with his kicking. The match, held at Tokyo's National Stadium, saw Brave Lupus, coached by Todd Blackadder, maintain their dominance after finishing the regular season at the top. Despite a strong defensive effort from the Spears, Brave Lupus held on to win in the final minutes amidst heavy rain. The final score was secured after Brave Lupus was able to soak up the defensive pressure in the final minutes under cloudy skies before heavy rain began soaking the Tokyo Olympic venue. The score of the game reflects the hard-fought nature of the championship final.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a strategic action plan targeting advancements in metrology, the science of measurement, by 2030, focusing on chip technology and quantum-scale measurement. The plan, issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation, seeks to address shortcomings in China's measurement capabilities, particularly in areas critical to industries like chip manufacturing and rare earth magnets. This initiative underscores the escalating technological rivalry between the U.S. and China, with both countries recognizing metrology as a foundational element for industries requiring precise measurements. The plan aims to comprehensively improve basic metrology capabilities, with key breakthroughs in over 50 core technologies by 2030. The focus on chip technology and rare earth magnets highlights the strategic importance of these sectors in the ongoing tech competition.</p>

          <h2>Stricter Voting Laws No Longer Benefit Republicans, Analysis Suggests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-held belief that stricter voting laws benefit Republicans is being challenged, as recent data indicates that these laws no longer provide the advantage they once did. Historically, lower voter turnout was seen as favorable to Republicans, as their affluent electorate was more likely to vote regardless of inconvenience. However, changing demographics and increased mobilization efforts among other groups have altered this dynamic. This shift suggests that Republicans may need to reassess their strategies regarding voting laws to maintain their electoral advantage. The change in voting patterns has led to a reassessment of traditional political strategies.</p>

          <p>China maintained a low profile at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia‚Äôs largest security summit, marked by the absence of its defense minister and the cancellation of a plenary session on China‚Äôs security. Instead of direct rebuttals from high-ranking officials, China's military academic institutions led the response to American messaging. The absence of Defence Minister Dong Jun, who attended last year, also meant that no bilateral talks occurred between China and other nations, including the U.S., at a time when Beijing faces scrutiny over its military capabilities. This subdued approach has sparked speculation about China's strategic intentions in the region and its approach to international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, plans to "restore Britain's war-fighting readiness" in response to growing Russian aggression and pressure from the US for NATO allies to strengthen their defenses. A new Strategic Defence Review will assess threats facing the UK and recommend increasing weapons production capacity and munition stockpiles. The government has committed to raising defense spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 and 3 percent by 2029. The review will also emphasize the integration of new technologies like drones and artificial intelligence into a modern fighting force, with a focus on countering threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The effort is designed to strengthen the UK's industrial base and enhance its security at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>ASEAN faces a critical opportunity to assert itself as a key player in global trade and geopolitics amidst the ongoing US-China rivalry. With a new free-trade agreement with China and potential tariff discussions with the U.S., ASEAN can leverage its diplomatic agility to foster a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem. This involves navigating internal divisions and external pressures to prioritize regional resilience and strategic autonomy. By shaping trade rules rather than merely adapting to them, ASEAN can redefine its role and become the architect of a new regional order. The ability of the organization to exploit the US-China rivalry hinges on its diplomatic agility.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender athlete, won two gold medals and a silver at the California high school track and field championship, sparking considerable debate. Hernandez competed under a new rule allowing an extra student to medal in events where a transgender athlete qualifies, ensuring that a "biological female" also receives a medal. During the qualifying events, a plane flew over the stadium with a banner stating, "No boys in girls' sports," and a small protest took place outside. The California Interscholastic Federation defended its decision, stating that the rule change would open the field to more "biological female" athletes. The inclusion of transgender athletes in sports remains a contentious issue, with some advocating for inclusion and others raising concerns about fairness.</p>

The Philippines' Defence Minister, Gilberto Teodoro Jr, also criticized China's actions in the South China Sea as "absolutely irresponsible and reckless."

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that while parenthood provides a sense of meaning and fulfillment, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. Researchers analyzed data from the European Social Survey across 30 countries, finding that parents generally feel their lives have deeper significance compared to childfree individuals. However, life satisfaction levels varied significantly based on factors such as living situation and family policies. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support systems, showed smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents, suggesting that societal support plays a crucial role in parental wellbeing. The study highlights the complex relationship between parenthood, societal support, and overall life satisfaction.</p>
