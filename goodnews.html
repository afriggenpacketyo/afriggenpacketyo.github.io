          <p>Actor Chris Pratt celebrated his son Jack's 13th birthday by sharing a rare collection of photos on social media, marking his oldest child's official entry into his teenage years. Pratt expressed his pride in the young man Jack is becoming, sharing images of them at sporting events and engaging in various activities. The article also touches upon how Jack's premature birth and early health scares profoundly deepened Pratt's religious faith, a commitment he continues to honor. This celebration offers a glimpse into his family life, which he shares with ex-wife Anna Faris and current wife Katherine Schwarzenegger.</p>

          <p>Early results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate that the country is heading for its first-ever runoff, signaling a significant political shift after nearly two decades of leftist rule. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz emerged as the surprise leader, while the candidate for the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS) party performed poorly, reflecting the party's worst electoral result in a generation. The election was held amid a severe economic crisis and the notable absence of former President Evo Morales, who was barred from running. The outcome suggests a potential end to the long-dominant socialist era in Bolivian politics.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including internet-driven slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." These additions reflect the significant impact of online culture, particularly from Gen Z and social media platforms, on the evolution of the English language. Other new entries like "mouse jiggler," related to remote work, and "forever chemical," tied to environmental concerns, also highlight contemporary societal shifts. Lexicographers noted that while it's unusual for such slang to be added, these terms were included because they are believed to have lasting power.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed a mixed performance as investors reacted to the recent U.S.-Russia summit, which concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. In China, the CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both edged higher. The market movements reflect ongoing uncertainty as investors await further details from the upcoming talks between Ukrainian President Zelensky, European leaders, and U.S. President Trump, which are expected to provide more clarity on the diplomatic path forward.

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen Mirren has stated her belief that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, she argued in a recent interview that casting a woman would fundamentally change the character into something else entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, who is her co-star in an upcoming film. This perspective adds to the ongoing debate about the future direction of the long-running spy franchise as producers plan for the next iteration of the character following Daniel Craig's departure.</p>

          <p>A renewed wave of pan-Africanism is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, as people increasingly seek to reconnect with their African heritage through culture, food, and travel. This movement is not just cultural but also economic, with governments and institutions on both sides of the Atlantic working to forge stronger trade and transportation links. Leaders have called for creating "air and sea bridges" and have even proposed a shared digital currency to facilitate commerce. This resurgence of interest, amplified by social media and the global popularity of Afrobeats, marks a new phase in the historic relationship between the two regions.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler clinched the BMW Championship title after a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole secured his victory. The win came after Scottish golfer Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot lead overnight, had a difficult final round, shooting a three-over-par 73. MacIntyre expressed deep frustration with his performance, particularly with his inability to control his shot distances, which led to an early collapse. Scheffler's consistent play under pressure allowed him to overcome his own minor slips and claim his 18th PGA Tour victory, finishing two strokes clear of the field.</p>

          <h2>Ban on Feeding Pigeons in Mumbai Sparks Debate Over Public Health and Tradition</h2>

          <p>A recent court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a fierce debate, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding birds is a pious act. The conflict highlights the challenge of balancing modern urban health standards with long-standing cultural and religious traditions in a city where pigeon feeding spots are iconic heritage sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two of China's largest pharmaceutical companies, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit growth for the first half of the year. Analysts attribute this strong performance to the successful introduction of new, innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. This strategic shift is reducing the companies' historical dependence on generic drug sales, which are expected to constitute a much smaller portion of their revenue in the coming years. The positive outlook reflects a successful transition toward higher-value, research-driven products in their business models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kristen Nuss and Taryn Brasher have won the AVP Manhattan Beach Open for the second year in a row, battling back to win a tight three-set final against Megan Kraft and Terese Cannon. Known as the "Wimbledon of beach volleyball," the victory solidifies their status as a top team. In the men's final, Chase Budinger and Miles Evans claimed the title by defeating the duo of Trevor Crabb and Phil Dalhausser. The event was particularly significant as it was one of the last tournaments for the legendary Dalhausser, a four-time Olympian who is retiring.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts delivered a decisive go-ahead home run in the eighth inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory and a crucial series sweep against the San Diego Padres. The dramatic blast was a significant moment for Betts, who has been experiencing a career-worst season at the plate, and it propelled the Dodgers into a two-game lead in the National League West. The game had been tied after the Dodgers bullpen relinquished an early four-run lead, setting the stage for Betts's clutch performance against the Padres' formidable closer, Robert Suarez.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a strategic crossroads, highlighted by its current leadership election. The race pits the "eco-populist" and more confrontational style of deputy leader Zack Polanski against the more moderate, community-focused approach of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns. Polanski advocates for a bolder, anti-elite message to connect with voter anger, while his opponents argue for continuing the proven strategy of broad appeal that led to the party's record success in the last general election. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to build on its recent gains.</p>

          <p>Spanish golfer Jon Rahm has been crowned the LIV Golf individual champion for the second consecutive year, securing the season-long title and its $18 million top prize. He clinched the championship despite losing in a playoff to Colombia's Sebastian Munoz at the final event in Indiana. Rahm's overall performance throughout the season was strong enough to place him ahead of his closest competitor, Joaquin Niemann of Chile. The result also had positive implications for European veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the league for the next season.</p>
