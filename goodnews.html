          <h2>Chinese Scientists Observe Quantum Friction Effect in Graphene for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has made a groundbreaking discovery by directly observing quantum friction in folded graphene. Contrary to classical physics, they found that friction did not always increase with thickness; some thicker folds actually slid more easily. This phenomenon was linked to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear, marking a significant advance in materials science.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, located north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2024. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for around $300,000 in a county where the median price is nearly $475,000. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing a temporary halt on construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines and roads to catch up. With 13,000 more homes already approved, the city is racing to manage its development as it projects a population of 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress Winona Ryder shared a quirky anecdote about her admiration for fellow actor Christopher Walken. She revealed that after he once gave her a rotisserie chicken, she kept the wishbone and is now attempting to fashion it into a necklace. Ryder also reminisced about having a significant crush on Al Pacino while working with him in her early twenties, even directly confessing her love to him. Now happily with her partner Scott Mackinlay Hahn, the actress shared these stories as lighthearted reflections on her past in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis legend Venus Williams' attempt to secure her first back-to-back tour wins since 2019 was ended by a 6-2, 6-2 loss to Magdalena Frech at the DC Open.

          <p>The Washington, D.C. city council has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving forward despite President Trump's recent threat to block it. Trump had demanded the team revert to its former “Redskins” name to secure a deal, a comment the council chairman dismissed as an unhelpful distraction. The agreement, which includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the city, now faces an initial vote on August 1. Despite the political hurdles, the proposal has widespread support from local politicians and residents who see it as a major economic opportunity.</p>

These data conversion operators process around 900 images of hard-to-read mail per hour, ensuring millions of otherwise undeliverable letters reach their intended destinations.

          <p>The 2028 Democratic presidential primary appears to be unofficially underway, as potential candidates are already making strategic media appearances and shifting their rhetoric. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom have been featured on non-traditional podcasts and are adopting more centrist positions on cultural issues, such as transgender rights. This activity is seen as an early effort to appeal to a broader electorate and correct for the party's 2024 loss. Strategists believe this signals a necessary course correction for the party to reconnect with voters who felt alienated.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a “winner-take-all” situation, and reducing investment would be a sign of disbelief in one's ability to win. Pointing to Alphabet's strong earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests the investments are both urgent and necessary. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly, similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The food industry is increasingly turning to natural sources for coloring as regulatory pressure mounts against artificial dyes like Red Dye No. 3. The FDA is phasing out certain petroleum-based dyes, prompting companies like Fermentalg and Sensient to innovate with alternatives derived from microalgae, carrots, and potatoes. While creating stable and vivid natural colors presents technical challenges, major food giants including Kellogg, Nestlé, and Kraft Heinz have pledged to eliminate artificial colors from their products. This marks a significant shift towards healthier ingredients, driven by consumer demand and new regulations.</p>
