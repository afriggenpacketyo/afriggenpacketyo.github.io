The filing revealed that Klarna's revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $823 million in the June quarter, although its net loss also widened during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has won the leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales in a landslide victory, signaling a more radical direction for the party.

In his victory speech, he criticized Labour leader Keir Starmer on issues like the two-child benefit cap and the conflict in Gaza, positioning the Greens as a more progressive political home.</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title, Liverpool has embarked on the largest summer spending spree in European football history, investing £415 million in new talent. The club broke the British transfer record twice, signing Florian Wirtz and then striker Alexander Isak for £125 million. This unprecedented financial outlay has intensified expectations, with many analysts suggesting that anything less than another Premier League title or a Champions League victory would be considered a failure for coach Arne Slot's team.</p>

          <p>A decade after its formation in a mega-merger, Kraft Heinz has announced it will split into two independent, publicly traded companies. The move reverses the 2015 deal orchestrated by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, which struggled to deliver growth amid cost-cutting and shifting consumer tastes. One new entity will focus on brands like Heinz and Philadelphia, while the other will manage names such as Oscar Mayer and Lunchables, with the goal of unlocking greater value for shareholders.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested three dockworkers in Sydney after discovering 1,116 pounds of cocaine, with a street value over $107 million, hidden behind a false wall in a shipping container. The arrests are part of a targeted operation by a multi-agency task force aimed at disrupting organized crime syndicates that use "trusted insiders" within the supply chain to import illicit drugs. The men, two of whom were forklift drivers, face potential life sentences if convicted on drug importation charges.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its "Luban Workshop" initiative, a global vocational education program designed to enhance the skills of local labor forces in partner countries. Named after an ancient Chinese architect, the workshops are a key part of Beijing's soft power strategy and are often linked to its Belt and Road Initiative. President Xi Jinping recently announced plans to launch 10 additional workshops in Shanghai Cooperation Organisation member states, aiming to provide training for 10,000 individuals over the next five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists are increasingly focusing on "dark taxa," a term for groups of organisms, primarily small insects, mites, and fungi, where the vast majority of species are unknown to science. Researchers estimate that for every known species, there may be nine others yet to be discovered, meaning around 90% of life on Earth is unidentified. Advances in DNA sequencing and barcoding technology are now enabling scientists to identify these overlooked species at an unprecedented rate, which is crucial for understanding ecosystem health and biodiversity.</p>

          <p>A powerful solar storm has made the aurora borealis visible across the United Kingdom, with sightings reported from northern Scotland down to Kent on the south coast. The phenomenon was caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun, which sent charged particles interacting with Earth's atmosphere to create the vibrant light display. Space weather forecasters suggest the activity could continue, offering another chance for people across the UK to witness the Northern Lights, provided skies remain clear.</p>

          <p>At age 37, Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is experiencing a renaissance season, which he attributes to a fundamental shift in his training regimen. After years of back problems, Kershaw has embraced a new approach focusing on the mobility and stability of his hips, pelvis, and lower back—an area his trainers have nicknamed "the bowl." This departure from his old, heavy-lifting routine has allowed him to feel healthier and more consistent on the mound, contributing to a stellar performance in his 18th MLB season.</p>

          <p>As Britpop nostalgia surges with a massive Oasis reunion tour, the band Suede, widely credited with starting the movement, is looking forward, not back. In an interview, the band reflects on its complex legacy, having distanced itself from the jingoistic turn Britpop later took. With their tenth studio album, "Antidepressants," Suede continues to evolve creatively, embracing an "anti-nostalgia" philosophy focused on longevity and artistic restlessness rather than capitalizing on the revival of a past era.</p>
