          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a town hall in Brooklyn, addressing a crowd of 1,700 about combating oligarchic influence in politics. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a crucial test for democracy against billionaire-funded opposition. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, has gained progressive support for his policies, including rent freezes and increased taxes on the wealthy. The event highlighted the growing progressive movement within the Democratic party and Mamdani's focus on issues like housing justice and immigrant rights.</p>

The drawing on Saturday night came after 41 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with a Powerball of 17. A potential winner can choose between an annuitized prize paid over 30 years or a lump sum cash value of approximately $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method for launching small robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials, which boils nearby water droplets and creates bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects several feet into the air. This innovative technique could have future applications in robotics, allowing for controlled jumping or even swimming on wet surfaces.</p>

Despite a tense moment when she failed to serve out the match, Sabalenka regained composure to dominate the tie-break. With this win, she becomes the first woman to win back-to-back US Open championships since Serena Williams accomplished the feat from 2012 to 2014.</p>

          <p>Schools across the United States are implementing Yondr pouches, a system that uses locked magnetic cases, to enforce bans on student cellphone use during school hours. As districts in at least 35 states adopt stricter phone policies, the pouches allow students to keep their phones with them but prevent access until they are unlocked at magnetic stations at the end of the day. While some students and educators praise the system for reducing distractions and increasing engagement, others have expressed frustration and found ways to circumvent the technology. The company reports significant growth as more schools seek solutions for managing technology in the classroom.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin served as a platform for China to project its growing geopolitical influence and present an alternative vision for global governance. Led by President Xi Jinping, the summit sought to contrast China's role as a stable partner with what it perceives as the unreliability of the United States under President Trump. The friendly interactions between Xi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and India's Narendra Modi were particularly symbolic, suggesting an alignment of Eurasian powers. The forum emphasized cooperation on security and economic integration, positioning the SCO as a key institution in a multipolar international system.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was compensated with team merchandise and a meeting with a player after a viral video showed an adult woman taking a home run ball from him. During a game against the Miami Marlins, Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader hit a home run, and after the boy's father initially gave him the ball, a woman confronted them and took it. In response, the Marlins staff gave the boy a gift bag. After the game, Bader met the young fan and gave him an autographed bat, turning a negative moment into a memorable experience.</p>

          <p>At its recent party conference, Reform UK made a concerted effort to promote emerging political figures, aiming to counter the perception that it is solely dependent on its leader, Nigel Farage. The party highlighted new recruits and local leaders, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, many of whom are former Conservative supporters. This strategy is part of a broader ambition to expand the party's electoral presence across the UK. As Reform UK prepares for upcoming elections, it is focusing on vetting and developing a larger pool of candidates to build a more robust political organization.</p>

          <p>A new community interest company, "Sisters in Service," is providing a vital support network for female military veterans in the UK who now work in healthcare. Co-founded by Dr. Bex Bennett, an army veteran and NHS psychiatrist, the group addresses the unique challenges women face after serving in combat zones like Iraq and Afghanistan. Many female veterans feel isolated and misunderstood in traditional support spaces, where their front-line roles are often overlooked. The group offers a "cathartic" connection through shared experiences, helping members navigate the transition from military to civilian life and demanding healthcare careers.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian military is extensively using a wide array of decoys, from inflatable tanks to flat-pack wooden howitzers, to mislead Russian forces and deplete their resources. These realistic mock-ups are designed to draw fire from expensive Russian munitions, such as Lancet drones, onto worthless targets. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in producing these decoys, which can be quickly assembled on the front lines to mimic real military positions. This strategy of deception is a key element of Ukraine's defense, forcing Russia to waste time, effort, and valuable ammunition on fake equipment.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document Catholic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican has attributed two miracles to his intercession, fulfilling the requirements for sainthood. His canonization is seen by some as an effort by the Church to connect with younger generations, celebrating a modern figure who enjoyed video games and wore jeans.</p>

          <p>As Dame Anna Wintour transitions from editor-in-chief of US Vogue to a global editorial director role, the iconic fashion magazine faces a critical juncture. For nearly four decades, Wintour defined Vogue's cultural influence, famously merging high fashion with mainstream celebrity culture by featuring figures like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits a brand that must now compete in a fast-paced digital landscape dominated by social media. The transition raises questions about whether Vogue can maintain its status as a premier arbiter of style without Wintour's singular vision at the helm.</p>
