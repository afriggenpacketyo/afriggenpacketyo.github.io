          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their campus earlier this year. The event was bittersweet for the 740 graduating seniors, as they had hoped to celebrate at their beloved Stadium by the Sea. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the students, acknowledging the adversity they faced. The Hollywood Bowl was offered to the school at a reduced cost, allowing the students to celebrate their resilience in a memorable setting.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study, published in Science Bulletin, details the structural analysis of feathers dating back 99 million years. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was essential to bird evolution. While modern birds are descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flying ability.</p>

          <h2>First Bacteria Encountered at Birth Can Protect Against Hospitalization, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 20:48:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that good bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Babies with B. longum were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The protective bacteria were found only in babies delivered vaginally, suggesting early microbial encounters are crucial for immune system development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The order halts work on the onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. Sable's efforts to reactivate the Santa Ynez Unit, including offshore platforms and pipelines, have faced legal challenges due to concerns about environmental review and public input. The ruling will remain in effect until at least July 18, forcing Sable to push back its restart timeline to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women are being warned against using weight-loss injections due to unknown risks to unborn babies. Drug safety experts in the UK advise women trying for a baby, pregnant, or breastfeeding to stop using medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) emphasizes that women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice.</p>
