          <h2>Trump Fails to Sway SALT Caucus on Tax Bill Support</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attempt to convince House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill fell short due to disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The bill proposes raising the SALT deduction to $30,000, but some GOP lawmakers from high-tax states consider this insufficient. Trump urged the SALT Caucus to "let it go," but their opposition could jeopardize the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend. The 2017 tax law capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, a move seen as targeting Democratic-leaning states.</p>

          <p>A woman named Chloe Gray went viral on TikTok for bringing a whole rotisserie chicken as her carry-on luggage on a flight from Newark to California. Gray, a social media influencer, jokingly referred to the chicken as her "designer bag" and claimed it was a convenient way to have a healthy meal during her travels. While TSA agents questioned her about the unusual item, they ultimately allowed her to proceed. Other passengers expressed mixed reactions, with some finding the strong smell disruptive.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and Scotland from 1992) could be eligible for up to ¬£70 each following a court ruling that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair.

Consumers who lived in the specified regions for at least three months during the eligibility period and purchased goods from UK businesses accepting Mastercard are entitled to claim.

          <p>The FDA has outlined new, more stringent guidelines for approving future COVID-19 vaccine boosters for healthy Americans, requiring new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. This contrasts with the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response. For high-risk individuals (adults 65+ and those with underlying conditions), the FDA will still accept immunogenicity data. The agency aims to balance regulatory flexibility with rigorous scientific standards, acknowledging the uncertain benefit of repeat vaccinations for low-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>The availability of EU e-gates for UK passport holders this summer remains uncertain, as the EU Commission indicates access won't be granted until the new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) is implemented in October 2025. Even then, the decision rests with individual countries. The EES collects biometric data on non-EU citizens entering the bloc. While a recent UK-EU agreement removes legal barriers to e-gate use post-EES, talks with individual EU nations are ongoing to potentially allow British passengers to use e-gates sooner.</p>

          <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Chief Movement Officer at Zimmer Biomet, emphasizes the importance of staying active for healthy aging, even with joint problems. He encourages people to "do something," whether it's tennis, skiing, or weightlifting, rather than stopping movement altogether. Schwarzenegger shares his own experiences with surgery and body part replacement, urging people to overcome their fears and seek treatment. He connects this message to the current political moment, advocating for action and progress despite challenges.</p>
