          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses the evolving US-China rivalry, extending beyond trade to technology and ideologies. She asserts that concerns over trade protectionism's impact on China's economy are exaggerated, noting that US exports constitute only about 2.8% of China's GDP. Qian emphasizes the critical role of women's voices in policymaking and highlights China's unique approach to innovation compared to Western models, contributing to a broader understanding of global economic dynamics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines whether today's great powers will manage hegemonic transitions through "managed accommodation," akin to Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai, or through confrontation. It argues that a multipolar order is already present, shaped by economic fundamentals. Two key distinctions from past transitions are nuclear weapons, making total war irrational, and technological interdependence, creating immense costs for systemic rupture. The article suggests that these factors compel major economies to avoid systemic breakdown, favoring patient statecraft over confrontation.</p>

          <p>Lara Trump, host of "My View with Lara Trump," shared her "no-wait-at-the-gate" travel strategy, aiming to arrive at the airport just as her boarding zone is called. She claims this method maximizes time, avoids unnecessary waiting, and became a habit during busy campaign seasons. The strategy, which involves using airline apps and Google for flight tracking, has sparked debate among travelers, with some agreeing and others expressing anxiety about cutting it too close.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, examining the multilayer windshield designed to function even if a layer is damaged. The NTSB will determine if an object struck the Boeing 737 and review flight data, though much of its staff is furloughed due to the government shutdown.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, as host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," utilized her appearance to address criticisms of her provocative pop persona.

Her opening monologue and other sketches directly referenced the controversy surrounding her album cover, "Man's Best Friend," and her "lusty" adult image. The article suggests Carpenter's performance served as a defiant and humorous response, implying she is "in on the joke" and dismissing concerns about her sexuality.</p>
