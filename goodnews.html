GM's CEO, Mary Barra, emphasized the company's commitment to American innovation, manufacturing expertise, and job support, highlighting the ability to offer customers a wide range of vehicle choices.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded after a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump, fueled by Musk's sharing of a video showcasing Tesla's driverless vehicles being tested in Austin, Texas. The video displayed a Model Y SUV with "Robotaxi" branding navigating an intersection without a human safety supervisor. This development suggests Tesla is nearing the launch of its autonomous driving technology, with a pilot program expected in Austin. The company's stock performance reflects investor optimism regarding Tesla's advancements in autonomous driving and a potential easing of tensions between Musk and Trump (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's military-civilian fusion strategy, aimed at integrating military and civilian technology, faces challenges primarily from internal red tape. While Beijing has encouraged private sector participation in defense orders, state-owned conglomerates still dominate the sector. The plan, designed to modernize the military, has seen some success in developing advanced equipment. However, it also poses risks for private firms due to U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies accused of aiding the People‚Äôs Liberation Army.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, is a worthy successor to the original, taking an 'if-it-ain‚Äôt-broke' approach to gaming. It is a refinement of the original Switch's ideas, offering improvements in size, strength, resolution, and new features like mouse-capable Joy-Cons and enhanced chat. Battery life in handheld mode may be a challenge, with about two hours of gameplay for demanding titles. While the launch lineup is limited, the improvements and potential of new games like 'Mario Kart World' make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking an upgraded gaming experience.</p>

Disputes over these issues arose after previous talks in Geneva, leading to the temporary reduction of tariffs on each other's goods.
