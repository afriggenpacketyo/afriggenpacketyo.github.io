          <p>China has achieved a significant naval aviation milestone with the successful catapult launch of its J-35 stealth fighter jet from the Fujian aircraft carrier. This event marks the J-35 as the world's second carrier-based stealth fighter, after the F-35 series, and demonstrates the Fujian's advanced electromagnetic catapult and recovery capabilities. The operation represents a substantial leap in the power and modernization of China's naval air wings. This development underscores China's growing military prowess and its commitment to expanding its carrier-based air power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use and expanding terminals, projected to increase annual flights significantly by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups, who warn of increased air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

          <p>A recent call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, described as "pragmatic, positive, and constructive" by Chinese state media, indicates a potential shift in US-China relations. Despite ongoing tensions and economic pressures, both nations appear to be moving towards accommodation rather than escalation. This emerging reality reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual dependence, particularly in economically asymmetric sectors like hi-tech and supply chains. The development suggests a framework of cautious competition, crucial for global stability, acknowledging that all-out conflict would be mutually devastating.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's new mutual defense pact with Pakistan is not expected to disrupt its established energy relationship with India, a senior source familiar with the matter indicated. The source clarified that Riyadh is diversifying its security alliances without compromising commercial ties, as India remains a crucial crude consumer. India, a long-standing rival of Pakistan and a BRICS alliance member, acknowledged the formalization of the arrangement and stated it would assess implications for national security and regional stability. Speculation about a shift away from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade was also dismissed as unfounded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) by one year if U.S. President Donald Trump agrees. The treaty, which limits strategic nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, is set to expire in February 2026. Putin stated this temporary extension would serve global non-proliferation interests and encourage dialogue with Washington on a successor agreement. Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, Russia seeks to spur arms control talks, emphasizing that the measure is contingent on the U.S. reciprocating and not undermining the existing balance of deterrence capabilities.</p>

          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both managed baskets of assets, possess key differences crucial for investors. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering real-time pricing, whereas mutual fund transactions are priced at day's end. Critically, ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to "in-kind" transactions that avoid capital gains distributions, a common issue for mutual funds in taxable accounts. ETFs also tend to have lower expense ratios. However, mutual funds offer a broader selection and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans, and some brokerages may not support automated ETF contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Citi Private Bank survey indicates that family offices are largely optimistic about their 2025 returns, with most expecting 5-10% or more. Many continue to favor direct investments in private companies, but there's a notable retreat from early-stage startup and seed funding. Instead, they are increasingly selective, focusing on growth-stage investments and opportunistic plays in secondary sales as institutional investors exit. This shift reflects a bullish outlook on specific long-term themes like AI and infrastructure, rather than broad asset classes, allowing them to leverage reliable cash flow from operating businesses.

          <p>Neurologists are recommending walnuts as a key food to help reduce the risk of dementia, a condition affecting cognitive function. Walnuts are highlighted for their rich content of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and potent antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Furthermore, walnuts support heart health, which is closely linked to brain health, by improving lipid profiles. Alongside walnut consumption, experts advise following the MIND diet, staying physically active, ensuring quality sleep, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities to maintain cognitive health.</p>
