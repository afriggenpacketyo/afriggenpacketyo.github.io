        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exceptionally powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves that prompted warnings and advisories for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and other Pacific nations. The quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, caused flooding in parts of Russia, but the resulting waves in other regions like Hawaii and California were smaller than initially feared, leading to minor flooding but no major damage. Authorities urged coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution. By Wednesday afternoon, most warnings had been downgraded or lifted.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, several teams made significant moves to strengthen their rosters for the postseason push. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired star closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins, a major move aimed at bolstering their bullpen. In other key trades, the New York Mets added relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley, while the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates. These deals highlight a competitive market for high-impact players, particularly relief pitchers, as contenders finalize their teams for the stretch run.</p>

          <p>The United States has reached a trade deal with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on goods, including cars and semiconductors, thereby avoiding a threatened 25% levy. As part of the agreement, South Korea will also invest $350 billion in the U.S., with a significant portion dedicated to shipbuilding. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung praised the deal for maintaining competitiveness and for protecting sensitive agricultural sectors like rice and beef from further market opening. However, steel and aluminum imports will face a higher 50% tariff, consistent with rates applied to other nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's own operators. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would be less costly and disruptive by avoiding the need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company estimates its project would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035. This marks the first time a rival bid has been formally considered for the long-debated expansion, introducing new competition into the major infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue. The company's revenue surged by 45% year-over-year to $989 million, while its funded customer accounts grew to 26.5 million. This performance was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion. The company is also seeing success in its push into wealth management and retirement accounts, signaling a strategic expansion beyond its retail trading origins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani created a moment of concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning. The team later announced the two-way phenom was only suffering from cramping on a hot and humid night, a relief for the team and its fans. Ohtani was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost the contest 5-2. The early exit came during his longest pitching outing of the season as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery, but the injury appears to be minor.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision keeps the rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though an unusual dissent from two board members who favored a cut signals a potential shift in thinking. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic environment, weighing a stable job market against concerns about the inflationary impact of tariffs and a recent rebound in GDP growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cautious approach, stating the full effects of the administration's new trade policies are not yet clear. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia, scientists explain the complex recipe required to create a tsunami. The key ingredients include a powerful underwater earthquake, typically magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes a vertical shift in the seafloor. The depth of the quake and its proximity to the surface are also critical factors. While forecasting remains challenging, modern deep-ocean sensors are improving prediction accuracy. Scientists note that tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and grow in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which is when they become most dangerous.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has captured unprecedented images of vibrant ecosystems at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team discovered what they describe as "thriving communities" of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, challenging previous assumptions about life in such extreme environments. These lifeforms exist in total darkness and under immense pressure, fueled by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that these chemosynthetic ecosystems may be far more widespread in the planet's deepest trenches than previously thought.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that concrete evidence for negative outcomes is lacking. Many studies linking screens to depression or sleep loss rely on flawed self-reported data and fail to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some researchers maintain that excessive social media use correlates with poor mental health, others argue there's no consistent signal of cognitive decline in large data sets. This ongoing scientific debate leaves parents with inconsistent guidance, highlighting the complexity of understanding technology's true effect on development.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used advanced near-infrared photography to reveal the stunningly detailed tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution images show intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures that were previously difficult to see, showcasing a level of sophistication that would challenge a modern tattoo artist. By working with a specialist in ancient tattooing techniques, the team concluded the designs were likely stenciled and applied with multi-pointed tools. The findings offer a rare, personal glimpse into the artistic and cultural practices of this ancient nomadic people.</p>

At 30 years old, he is seen by defensive coordinator Chris Shula as the "Yoda" of the position group, providing a calming and savvy presence for younger teammates. After a successful 2023 season, the Rams re-signed Witherspoon to a one-year deal, a move he sees as a vote of confidence in the existing defensive personnel. Witherspoon is embracing his mentorship role, aiming to combine the defense's aggressive front with the secondary's experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the immense power of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast, the resulting tsunami caused far less damage than its size might suggest. Scientists explain that key factors, including the tsunami's location and directionality, played a crucial role in mitigating its impact on populated areas. The main energy of the tsunami was directed into the open Pacific, roughly between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching the U.S. West Coast. While the area near the epicenter saw damage, this "best-case scenario" for distant regions highlights the complex variables that determine a tsunami's destructive power.</p>
