        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anticipation for the Wimbledon semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner is tempered by injury concerns for both top players. Djokovic, 38, canceled a practice session after an awkward fall in his quarter-final, raising questions about his physical readiness for the high-stakes match. Similarly, world number one Sinner is managing a right elbow injury sustained earlier in the tournament, despite stating he would be "100% fit." These fitness uncertainties add a layer of drama to the highly awaited clash between the seasoned champion and the young star.</p>

          <p>The recent OPEC seminar, held at Vienna's historic Hofburg palace, brought together global energy leaders, including ministers and CEOs from major oil companies, to discuss the state of the market and investment. The lavish event was contrasted by protests held nearby, where demonstrators called for an oil embargo and voiced support for Gaza, highlighting geopolitical tensions influencing the energy sector. Key figures like Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman addressed the conference, while notable absences included ministers from Russia and Iran, with the latter participating via video link.</p>

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's request to replace the roof on his historic £2 million mansion in Scotland has been denied by the Perth and Kinross Council. His proposal sought to substitute the "beyond repair" lead roof with a modern Sarnafil membrane, citing issues with leaks and the risk of lead theft. However, the council determined that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the building's special architectural interest and character. This decision presents a setback for the actor's efforts to renovate the 18th-century property he purchased in 2023.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with new car registrations jumping 54% in June year-over-year, in stark contrast to declining sales across much of Europe. This success is largely attributed to the popularity of the updated Model Y, which aligns well with Norwegian consumer preferences for practicality and value. The trend persists despite a European backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a Norwegian survey confirmed is a concern for many potential buyers. Norway's strong pro-EV policies continue to bolster Tesla's dominant market position there.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has reportedly blown up approximately 300 dams and shut down hydropower facilities along the Red River, a key tributary in the upper Yangtze River basin. The project aims to save the habitats of numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been critically endangered by decades of infrastructure development. The dense network of dams had previously blocked fish migration routes, altered water flows, and reduced spawning grounds. This large-scale removal represents a major policy shift toward prioritizing ecological recovery in the region.</p>

During the hearing, the judge expressed skepticism about the government's defense, noting a lack of specific evidence to justify the arrests and refuting claims of racial profiling.
