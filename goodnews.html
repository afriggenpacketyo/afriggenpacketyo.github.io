          <p>Naoya "Monster" Inoue retained his undisputed super bantamweight world championship by defeating Ramon Cardenas with an eighth-round technical knockout. Cardenas surprised Inoue with a knockdown in the second round, but Inoue recovered and dominated the later rounds, eventually stopping Cardenas in the eighth. Inoue expressed surprise at the knockdown but maintained composure, adapting his strategy from the third round onward. He also confirmed his next fight would be against Murodjon Akhmadaliev in Japan in September, as he looks to conquer a fifth weight class.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the popular association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of the flower was likely a single-petal yellow flower with seven leaflets. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers', are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, coming in a wide array of shapes, sizes, and colours.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly catching up to, and in some cases surpassing, the United States in critical technologies like artificial intelligence, according to a recent New York Times article. The authors, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu, point to the rapid development and deployment of AI models, electric vehicles, and robotics in China. They argue that China's open-source approach to AI and its efficient manufacturing capabilities are giving it a competitive edge. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its lead.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations was primarily attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with sharp increases in previous years due to resumed projects after the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan views ODA as a key diplomatic tool in the Indo-Pacific region, despite its tight fiscal situation.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas is the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan. The Japan Tourism Agency found that 21.9% of foreign visitors surveyed cited this issue as their top concern. While the figure improved from the previous year, many respondents reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins in Japan is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, leading to increased littering in tourist spots.</p>
