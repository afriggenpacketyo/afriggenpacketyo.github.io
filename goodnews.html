          <p>Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, a long-tenured top executive and head of Uber's delivery business, is leaving the company after almost 13 years, having joined as a general manager in France in 2012 and rising to senior vice president of delivery in 2021. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi acknowledged Gore-Coty's significant contributions to Uber's global mobility expansion and his leadership of Uber Eats during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Andrew Macdonald will become chief operating officer, overseeing global mobility, delivery, autonomous businesses, and cross-platform functions. The company is currently facing a lawsuit from the FTC alleging deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in effect, a decision celebrated by gun-safety advocates. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing a desire to address the issue nationwide, while Justice Kavanaugh acknowledged the appeals court ruling as "questionable" but agreed with the decision to let the Maryland law stand for now. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons. The Supreme Court has previously upheld some gun restrictions, including bans on firearm purchases for those under domestic violence restraining orders and regulations targeting ghost guns.</p>

          <p>Robinhood has completed its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, a long-standing cryptocurrency exchange, signaling a strategic move beyond retail trading into institutional markets.

This acquisition allows Robinhood to enter deeper into institutional crypto flows, lending, staking infrastructure, and white-label "crypto-as-a-service" products.
