          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case of Ames v. Ohio, which involved a heterosexual woman who sued the Ohio Department of Youth Services for discrimination based on sexual orientation. Marlean Ames argued that she was discriminated against when the department hired a lesbian for a management position and later demoted her, replacing her with a gay man. Justice Jackson's opinion in the case has reset the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion, addressing the question of how much the law should treat a person as an individual rather than as a member of a group. This ruling underscores the complexities and nuances of discrimination law in the context of D.E.I. initiatives.</p>

During the 2024-25 season, he made 43 appearances for Sunderland, scoring four goals and providing three assists, demonstrating his growing capabilities.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, citing an "insurrection" and "violence" due to immigration protests, is based on a false premise, according to this article. Despite isolated clashes between protesters and federal authorities, the city is largely functioning as usual, with most Angelenos going about their daily lives. The deployment is seen as an expansion of presidential power and a tactic to target a Democratic city with a large immigrant population. While acknowledging that some protesters have engaged in violence, the article argues that local law enforcement is capable of handling the situation and that the National Guard's presence is unnecessary and inflammatory.</p>
