          <p>China's first police corgi was filmed pilfering a sausage from a child during a patrol, leading to a public reprimand. The incident prompted officials to enroll the dog in a training program focused on resisting food temptations. This reflects a broader effort to refine the skills of police dogs and improve community relations. The corgi's misbehavior highlights the challenges of training animals for law enforcement duties and ensuring they adhere to behavioral standards in public settings. The video of the incident quickly went viral, sparking a mix of amusement and concern among citizens.</p>

          <p>Learning new languages physically rewires the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, as demonstrated by a German study tracking Syrian refugees learning German. Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reshape neural pathways, strengthens areas related to language processing and executive function. Studies suggest that children learn languages more easily due to their brain's greater adaptability, processing new languages independently rather than translating from their first language. While multilingualism improves memory and problem-solving, it's uncertain whether it directly correlates with higher intelligence, as cognitive skills involve numerous factors beyond language learning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a highly effective antivenom using the blood of Tim Friede, who has been intentionally bitten by numerous species of deadly snakes over 18 years. Friede's self-immunization process made him "hyper-immune" to snake neurotoxins, allowing researchers to isolate target antibodies from his blood. The resulting antivenom protected mice against venom from various deadly snakes, including black mambas and king cobras. Researchers hope this broad-spectrum antivenom, potentially delivered via a "venom EpiPen," could be widely deployed in rural settings, improving treatment for snake bites globally.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere this weekend after orbiting for over five decades. The probe, originally intended for Venus, malfunctioned and remained in low Earth orbit. Astronomers predict it will likely splash down in water, but there is a small chance it could damage property or injure someone. The spacecraft's lander probe, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive reentry relatively undamaged, though its parachute's functionality remains uncertain after so many years.</p>
