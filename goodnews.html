        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is actively working to reduce internal bureaucracy as part of a broader cultural reset aimed at making the company operate more like a startup. Speaking at a conference, Jassy emphasized that bureaucracy is detrimental to innovation and detailed initiatives like flattening organizational structures and creating a "no bureaucracy email alias" for employees to flag inefficient processes. This strategy aligns with his recent cost-cutting measures, which included over 27,000 layoffs since 2022. The goal is to maintain a "scrappy" and agile culture despite Amazon's massive scale and diverse business operations.</p>

          <p>Democrat Xp Lee has won a special election for the Minnesota House seat previously held by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was tragically assassinated in June. Lee's victory over Republican Ruth Bittner restores the 67-67 tie in the chamber, preserving a crucial power-sharing agreement between the two parties. The election was held amidst heightened concerns over political violence, following Hortman's murder and the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lee's win prevents Republicans from gaining full control of the House and maintains the state's delicate political balance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell for the fourth consecutive month in August, but the 0.1% year-on-year decline was significantly less than economists had predicted. This better-than-expected performance was driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe, which helped offset a steep drop in trade with the United States. Despite the softer contraction, the country's economy faces ongoing challenges from U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba prepares to step down. The data comes as the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to speed up the European Union's move to end all oil and gas imports from Russia. The proposal aims to cut off the fossil fuel revenues that sustain Russia's war economy and finance the conflict in Ukraine. Von der Leyen stated she discussed the matter with U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed the EU will soon present its 19th package of sanctions targeting Russia's crypto, banking, and energy sectors. The current EU plan aims to halt Russian gas imports by 2028 and oil by 2027, but the new proposal seeks a faster timeline.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong should be considered a strong candidate to host China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging the front-runner, Shanghai. While Shanghai has extensive AI infrastructure, Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework offers a strategic advantage in navigating U.S.-China tech tensions. The city's independent legal system could help reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism, positioning it as a credible bridge between China and the global community. Co-hosting the center could leverage Shanghai's technical strengths with Hong Kong's unique international standing to shape global AI standards.</p>

          <p>A Norfolk man, Dan Cooper, has successfully brought his attacker to justice twenty years after he was sexually assaulted in 2004. Inspired to re-engage with the police after serving on a jury in 2018, Cooper's perseverance led to the conviction of Shaun Gilder, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for two counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration. Cooper, who waived his anonymity, described the long-term trauma and PTSD he suffered from the attack, which occurred when he was 17. He now shares his story on social media to help other survivors.</p>

          <p>A number of landlords in the United Kingdom are selling their rental properties ahead of the implementation of the new Renters' Rights Bill, a major legislative overhaul of the private rental sector. The bill will ban "no-fault" evictions, give tenants more power to challenge rent increases, and prohibit discrimination against those on benefits. While renters' advocates welcome the changes for providing greater security, some landlords express concern that the new regulations will make it harder to manage their properties, potentially leading to a contraction in the rental market and higher rents overall as supply decreases.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old woman in Chino Hills, California, successfully defended herself against an attempted robbery by throwing her freshly purchased tea at the attacker. The assailant, who brandished a knife, had reportedly demanded she hand over the beverage. The woman's quick thinking allowed her to flee the scene and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies responded and arrested 29-year-old Rashawn Lee at the shopping center shortly after the incident. Lee was booked on a robbery charge and later released on bail, with no injuries reported from the unusual confrontation.</p>

          <p>Tesla's dominance in the Australian electric vehicle market is facing a significant challenge, with the company falling to 12th place in August sales as four Chinese brands entered the top 10. Companies like BYD, GWM, Chery, and MG have seen a surge in sales, indicating a shift in consumer preference, partly dubbed "the Elon effect" due to potential consumer sentiment against CEO Elon Musk's politics. This trend reflects a more competitive global EV market where Tesla is no longer the default choice. Increased competition from more affordable Chinese models is providing Australian consumers with more options. (not investment advice)</p>

While the deal is hailed as a major step for the UK economy, concerns remain about the high energy consumption of AI data centers and the UK's increasing reliance on foreign technology.

          <p>This article pays tribute to the career of actor and director Robert Redford, highlighting his deliberate choice to pursue complex, often flawed characters instead of relying on his conventional good looks for simple heroic roles. From his early rejection of lucrative but unchallenging TV work to his iconic performances in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men," Redford consistently used his platform to explore the underbelly of American idealism. The piece argues that his legacy is defined not just by the memorable roles he played, but also by his commitment to challenging audiences and using his charisma to critique power and superficiality.</p>

          <p>Five partially built homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished following a decades-long legal and community dispute. The city attorney announced a plea agreement with the developers that mandates the removal of the dilapidated structures, which were first ordered to be torn down in 2003 after construction was halted. Over the years, a series of owners failed to comply with the demolition order, leading to ongoing safety concerns and frustration for residents. The current owners pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders and must now demolish the homes by August 2026.</p>

He attributes this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the "statesmanship" of CEO Jamie Dimon. Currently valued at around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has performed strongly, and Cramer notes that a key driver for its continued growth is the expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple as Wall Street shows renewed willingness to invest in the banking sector.

          <p>New data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals a significant shift in driver preference in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This trend is largely driven by the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. According to the AA, learners are adapting to an electric driving future, viewing the skill of driving a manual car as increasingly irrelevant. This marks a substantial increase from a decade ago when only about 6% of tests were in automatics.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and high winds lift the old, loose ash back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity, as the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, the resuspended ash is considered a potential hazard for aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's approach to football has shifted towards a more pragmatic, defensive style under new manager Thomas Frank, a stark contrast to the attack-focused strategy of the previous season. The team's recent 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal marked their fourth clean sheet in five games, a testament to this new "clean sheet mentality." While the cautious style resulted in only one shot on target for Spurs, the defense was highly effective, preventing Villarreal from registering any shots on goal. Players and the manager have acknowledged the change, emphasizing the importance of being a difficult team to score against.</p>
