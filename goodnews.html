          <p>Warren Buffett addressed recent stock market volatility during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, stating that fluctuations are a normal part of investing and should not cause fear. He highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has experienced significant declines multiple times in the past without indicating fundamental issues with the company. Buffett emphasized that he views market downturns as opportunities and would welcome a 50% drop in Berkshire's stock as a chance to buy more, reinforcing his long-term perspective on investing.

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive term in Australia's election, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat.

Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both sides addressing the cost-of-living crisis affecting many Australian households. Albanese emphasized improved relations with China and criticized the opposition's adoption of "American-style politics," focusing on division rather than unity.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is on track to secure another sweeping victory in the general elections, bolstering Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's mandate as he faces his first test at the ballot box since assuming office last year. The projected results represent an improvement for the PAP compared to the 2020 election, with the opposition Workers Party expected to retain its 10 seats. Voters' concerns centered on living costs and housing availability in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities. Wong's government has warned of potential recession due to the impact of higher tariffs on exports to the United States and any downturn in global trade.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second term, marking a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party amid global uncertainties stemming from the Trump administration. The election saw a resounding defeat of the conservative opposition, whose leader, Peter Dutton, also lost his parliamentary seat, mirroring the ouster of Canada's conservative leader. Albanese emphasized that Australians had chosen to face global challenges in their own way, rejecting the need to copy from overseas. The election took place against a backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with both parties offering incremental relief proposals rather than ambitious changes to address fundamental issues.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring long, unnarrated coverage of events like jellyfish drifting or elk migrations, has gained popularity as a calming alternative to fast-paced media. Originating in Norway in 2009, Slow TV has expanded globally, with shows like Sweden's "Great Elk Trek" drawing millions of viewers. The appeal lies in its ability to offer relaxation and reflection, contrasting with the rapid pace of news and social media. This form of entertainment also provides educational opportunities and fosters a deeper connection with nature, potentially inspiring climate-conscious behavior, though experts note it cannot fully replace real-world experiences in nature.</p>

While defending Harvard against federal intrusion, Garber has also implemented changes to student discipline, protest management, and faculty hiring, aiming to shift the campus culture.

CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that expanding Discover's international presence could further enhance these benefits, motivating the company to shift more of its Capital One-branded credit cards to the Discover network. The company estimates $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027, driven by expense savings and network benefits, with a regulatory advantage for its debit-card business due to exemptions from the Durbin amendment.

The study identifies three regions in the state that could support a robust grizzly population and notes that half the state is public land, facilitating reintroduction efforts. While the idea has garnered support, it also faces challenges due to potential conflicts with humans, and the study emphasizes the need for a slow, deliberate, and careful process involving local communities.

          <p>Financial markets are increasingly acting as a check on populist excesses, as the interconnectedness of world trade and the costs of disrupting supply chains spook investors. Andy Haldane, former chief economist of the Bank of England, argues that the "excess sensitivity of financial markets" applies a double-lock, disciplining politicians who claim they can weather short-term pain. This has led to a more rapid capitulation from leaders, who understand they have less room for maneuver than they wanted. Despite this, the anger of those who consider themselves losers from the old system remains, potentially leading to social unrest.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett expressed his opposition to President Trump's use of tariffs as a weapon in trade, telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that the US shouldn't anger the rest of the world. Buffett emphasized that balanced trade is best but criticized Trump's approach, stating that the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous. Despite his criticism of Trump's trade policies, Buffett reiterated his long-term optimism about the United States and acknowledged Berkshire's large cash holdings due to a lack of attractively priced investments. The meeting drew thousands of attendees, including celebrities and well-known investors.</p>

          <p>Fivespan Partners, an activist investment firm, has taken a stake in Qiagen NV, a life sciences tools company, and is engaging with management to unlock shareholder value. Fivespan believes Qiagen has strong strategic assets but has struggled to create shareholder value post-Covid, and the activist sees three levers to boost growth. These include investing in its core business, improving investor communication, tightening operations to expand margins, and optimizing the balance sheet. Fivespan appreciates businesses with multiple paths to shareholder value, including potential strategic transactions, and an unsolicited offer for Qiagen is not outside the realm of possibility.</p>
