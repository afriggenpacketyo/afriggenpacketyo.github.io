          <p>The Japanese government is set to allocate 900 billion yen as part of an emergency economic strategy designed to mitigate the adverse effects of increased U.S. tariffs. This marks Japan's initial fiscal response to President Trump's trade duties. The overall relief package, encompassing spending by local governments, is projected to reach 2.8 trillion yen, aiming to address potential economic downturns.

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts to reduce escalating rice prices, with a target of approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move follows a pledge by the newly appointed farm minister to curb soaring prices, addressing public criticism regarding the government's ineffectiveness in managing rice prices amid rising inflation. The plan involves releasing 300,000 tons of rice, bypassing the traditional auction system, and includes considerations for online sales to broaden distribution. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to tackle high rice price issues.</p>
