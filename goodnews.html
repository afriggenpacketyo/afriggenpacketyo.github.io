          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is significantly expanding its economic and strategic presence in Africa, investing heavily in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects as the United States and China reduce their involvement. Since 2019, UAE firms have announced deals worth $110 billion, dwarfing investments from other countries, and is pushing into artificial intelligence and global investments as part of a broader bid to boost its influence over world supply chains. This strategic shift reflects the UAE's ambition to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and exert greater influence over global supply chains. However, concerns have arisen regarding the UAE's political choices and potential involvement in conflicts within the region.</p>
