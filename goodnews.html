          <p>Renowned pop star Lulu, 76, has publicly disclosed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the revelation as profoundly liberating. Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, having adeptly hidden her problem for decades, even while participating in "Strictly Come Dancing." The article connects her journey to a childhood marked by her father's alcoholism and family trauma, emphasizing the deep-seated generational impact of the disease. Lulu hopes sharing her story will help other alcoholics and break negative patterns within families, expressing profound gratitude for her inherent tenacity and resilience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea academy graduate Tyrique George, 19, delivered a standout performance in the Carabao Cup, scoring and assisting to secure a comeback victory against Lincoln City. This crucial contribution comes after a potential £22m move to Fulham fell through, offering him a lifeline at his boyhood club. Playing out of his usual position as a lone striker, George impressed manager Enzo Maresca, who had previously deemed him surplus to requirements amidst a string of new attacking signings. His display suggests he could be a valuable option for Chelsea's attack, potentially disrupting the common academy pathway of breakthrough, loan, and eventual sale.</p>

Trump urged spouses of heads of government to lead programs in their countries and announced the first meeting at the White House in early 2026. The initiative plans to collaborate with the private sector to expand access to innovative educational technologies, including AI, robotics, and blockchain, while also exchanging best practices about AI's advantages and risks.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police believe they have identified the dismembered remains of a woman found in 1946 along the Willamette River as Oak Grove Jane Doe, the state's oldest unidentified victim. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing, but the Oregon State Police Medical Examiner’s Office’s Human Identification Program located her remains under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946." Authorities are now conducting advanced forensic testing, hoping to finally restore the victim's name and identity to history. This development brings hope for closure in a case that garnered national attention due to its grisly nature and the victim's cause of death by blunt force trauma.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off during a Carabao Cup match after receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt while celebrating a late winning goal against Southampton. Manager Arne Slot criticized the 20-year-old's actions as "stupid, not smart," highlighting that it led to his suspension for the upcoming Premier League game against Crystal Palace. Ekitike, a £69m signing who has been in excellent form, later apologized on social media, attributing his actions to overwhelming emotion. This incident serves as an important learning experience for the young forward, despite his crucial contribution to the team's victory.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering scholar of Chinese law who significantly shaped global debates on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades, has died at 95. As professor emeritus at NYU School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen was the first American to practice law in Communist China. His groundbreaking writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law are considered foundational and remain widely read by legal scholars. Cohen built a reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, leaving a towering impact on the field and influencing generations of China scholars.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made a dramatic shift in his foreign policy, suggesting Ukraine can win back all its territory from Russia, a stark contrast to his previous stance. This reversal followed meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron at the UN. The article analyzes whether Trump genuinely believes in Ukraine's victory or if he is simply "washing his hands" of the conflict due to perceived humiliation from Putin. Despite his aggressive rhetoric, Trump's statements lacked concrete action items, leading to speculation that this shift might be a strategy to normalize relations with Russia by ditching the Ukraine war as an intractable problem.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, awaiting the governor's signature, seeks to prohibit streaming services like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their accompanying programming. The legislation was spurred by persistent consumer complaints, including a new mother disturbed by loud ads waking her sleeping newborn. This bill expands upon the federal CALM Act, which already regulates commercial volume for broadcast, satellite, and cable TV but notably excludes streaming platforms. While streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, they became neutral after an amendment removed provisions allowing private lawsuits, focusing enforcement on regulators. The initiative aims to address widespread viewer frustration over jarring advertisement volume.</p>

Announced at a UN sideline event, this initiative gains significant momentum for its debut at COP30 in Belem this November. The facility will invest in low-risk assets, channeling returns to tropical countries based on keeping annual deforestation below 0.5%, with penalties for forest loss and degradation. Brazil's President Lula da Silva pledged $1 billion, emphasizing it as an investment in humanity and the planet. The scheme aims to provide predictable, long-term finance for forest nations, with at least one-fifth of resources dedicated to Indigenous peoples and local communities.</p>

Senior Liberal Democrats see an opportunity to position themselves as a distinct alternative, appealing to former Conservative voters who are disaffected by both Reform and the current Tory leadership. Despite accusations of scaremongering and criticisms of media scrutiny, the Lib Dems aim to represent an authentic, small-c conservative patriotism, buoyed by internal polling suggesting broader voter openness to their party.</p>
