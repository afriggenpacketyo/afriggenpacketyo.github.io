          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is advocating for a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep more film and television productions in the United States, particularly in Hollywood. The proposal aims to address the employment crisis in the entertainment industry, which has been affected by the pandemic, strikes, and spending cutbacks. While the initiative has garnered support from Hollywood unions and industry groups, it faces significant obstacles, including political optics and competition from other national priorities. A federal tax incentive could provide much-needed support to the industry and help maintain California's position as the entertainment capital.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines must face a proposed class action lawsuit from passengers who claim the airline refused to offer full refunds after a computer outage in July 2024 caused flight delays and cancellations.

The outage, caused by a flawed software update, cost Delta an estimated $550 million in lost revenue and added costs.
