          <h2>UK Economy Shows Encouraging Growth Despite Lingering Cost of Living Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves reports that the UK economy is showing positive signs, with a 0.7% growth in the first quarter, exceeding forecasts. This growth is attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, though analysts caution that this pace may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. Businesses express mixed reactions, with some absorbing tariffs to maintain stability and others delaying decisions due to economic uncertainty. The Bank of England's recent interest rate cuts add further complexity to the economic outlook, potentially affecting mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

These hubs would house individuals awaiting deportation, differing from previous proposals to process claims abroad. The government has not specified which countries are involved in the discussions, though the western Balkans are a focus. Starmer acknowledged that the return hubs are not a complete solution but will complement efforts to combat people smuggling.</p>

Car repair costs are also soaring, driven by the increasing complexity of vehicle technology and a shortage of skilled technicians. Outerwear prices for both men and women have also increased, potentially reflecting shifts in consumer demand and the influence of specialty brands.</p>
