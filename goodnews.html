          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing reciprocal tariffs, deeming them unlawful. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping tariffs. The ruling specifically applies to tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking and reciprocal tariffs imposed to address trade imbalances. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while critics have hailed it as a victory for American families and businesses. Dow futures jumped 500 points following the news.

          <p>A federal court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to delegate tariff authority to the president. The court's decision argues that Trump surpassed these limits and that the tariffs don't effectively address the stated threats. The court also noted that the president may only impose tariff rates of 15 percent or lower, and those tariffs may only remain in effect for 150 days. The decision can be appealed, but if upheld, it could significantly limit Trump's ability to impose broad tariffs.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they might establish nesting sites. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles. These eagles have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The return of golden eagles is a positive sign for wildlife conservation, as they were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th century due to persecution.</p>
