          <p>Frontier Airlines is offering its annual "GoWild!" all-you-can-fly pass for a promotional price of $299 before it increases to $599. The pass, valid for 20 months through April 2027, allows for unlimited flights with significant restrictions, including limited booking windows and numerous blackout dates during peak travel periods. This strategic move is viewed by industry experts as an opportunity for Frontier to gain market share while other budget airlines face financial difficulties. Additional fees for extras like seat selection and checked bags still apply to passholders.</p>

          <p>An article provides a fact-check on several claims surrounding the landmark trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup. It clarifies that Bolsonaro is already barred from running in the 2026 election due to prior convictions, making claims that the trial's purpose is political disqualification misleading. The piece also addresses allegations of judicial bias, particularly against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, noting that while some legal experts have concerns, claims of a dictatorship are false. Demonstrations and public access to investigation findings indicate democratic processes are still functioning in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corp. has agreed to be acquired by a group of investors for $7.4 billion, a deal that will take the firm private. The acquisition is led by Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, along with asset managers Apollo and Brookfield. The move reflects a trend of consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry, which owns more than half of the world's passenger jets. A shortage of new aircraft has recently driven rental rates to record highs, making lessors attractive investment targets.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt consolidation offers a potential path to financial relief, primarily through two different methods: loans and programs. A debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new, single loan with a lower interest rate to pay off multiple existing debts, simplifying payments. In contrast, a debt consolidation program is a service offered by a debt relief company that negotiates with creditors on the borrower's behalf, often involving a structured payment plan. The best option depends on an individual's credit score, financial situation, and comfort level with managing the process independently.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taxpayers who find themselves owing money to the IRS have several options for settling their debt and avoiding severe consequences like liens or wage garnishment. These methods include establishing an installment agreement to make manageable monthly payments or applying for an offer in compromise, which may allow qualifying individuals to settle for less than the full amount owed. Other potential solutions are requesting a temporary delay in collection due to financial hardship or seeking a penalty abatement for reasonable cause. Working with tax relief professionals can also help navigate the complexities of negotiating with the agency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For consumers struggling with overwhelming credit card debt, forgiveness is a potential but complex option that involves settling with creditors for less than the full amount owed. This is typically achieved through debt settlement programs, where a company negotiates a lump-sum payment on the consumer's behalf, or as a last resort, through bankruptcy. The article clarifies there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs for credit card debt. While settlement can provide significant relief, it can also severely damage a person's credit score and may have tax implications on the forgiven amount.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers who have cut back on spending due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The revived menu, launching September 8, will feature deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move comes after the company's CEO acknowledged a decline in traffic from low-income consumers and sluggish breakfast sales. The focus on value follows the earlier introduction of the McValue menu and the return of the popular Snack Wrap.</p>

          <p>With a potential Federal Reserve rate cut looming, savers using Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should avoid several key mistakes this month. Experts advise against shopping around for the perfect rate for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their offers, making it crucial to lock in a high rate quickly. Another mistake is failing to monitor the rate climate closely, as changes can happen before the Fed's official announcement. Finally, savers with maturing CDs should avoid letting them automatically roll over into a new account, which will likely have a lower interest rate.</p>

          <p>While many retirees depend on Social Security, certain circumstances can lead to a reduction or loss of these benefits. Claiming benefits before full retirement age while still working can trigger temporary reductions if earnings exceed annual limits. Benefits can also be garnished to pay for federal debts like back taxes or student loans, and a portion of the benefits may be subject to income tax depending on one's total income. Furthermore, changes in eligibility, such as a divorced spouse remarrying before age 60, can also impact the amount received, highlighting the need for careful retirement planning.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie has filed a discharge petition in an attempt to force a full House vote on legislation compelling the Department of Justice to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, would require the release within 30 days. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that can bypass leadership to bring a bill to the floor if it gains 218 signatures. The move comes as House Republican leadership scheduled a different, less direct bill related to the Epstein investigation, which Massie criticized as a meaningless political cover.</p>

          <p>As the price of gold approaches record highs, beginner investors are advised to consider strategic ways to enter the market before a potential further surge. The article suggests that new investors should not be deterred by the high per-ounce price, as there are more affordable entry points like gold ETFs, stocks, or fractional gold bars and coins. It also recommends a dollar-cost averaging approach, where a fixed amount of money is invested at regular intervals, to build a position over time without a large initial outlay. Acting promptly is emphasized to avoid being priced out of the market entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, moving back above the $111,000 level, while the stock market experienced a downturn. The modest crypto gain was overshadowed by a significant rally in gold, which surpassed $3,500 an ounce for the first time, reinforcing its traditional safe-haven status amid economic uncertainty. The broader market sell-off was linked to concerns over the legality of global tariffs and their potential financial repercussions. While Bitcoin benefited from some of the same themes driving gold, its performance has recently been tempered by a market rotation into other crypto assets like Ethereum.</p>
