          <h2>Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from Ancient Tomato Ancestors Through Hybridization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 16:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. A study published in the journal Cell explains that a key gene from the ancient tomato enabled the formation of starchy tubers when combined with the genetics of the other wild plant. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, resolves a long-standing puzzle about the evolution of one of the world's most important food crops. The findings highlight how hybridization can drive the emergence of new traits and species.</p>

          <p>Meta and Microsoft both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, causing their stock prices to climb significantly. The strong performance is largely attributed to their substantial and ongoing investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with both companies signaling plans for continued high capital expenditures. Analysts suggest this increased spending will benefit chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. While some experts applaud Meta's aggressive AI strategy, others express caution about the high level of spending, even as the company's core business remains robust. (not investment advice)</p>

Figma, known for its web-based collaborative design tools, has over 13 million monthly users and counts major tech companies among its clients. The strong market reception suggests investor confidence in the tech sector and could encourage more companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, Wall Street will be scrutinizing the company's significant capital expenditures on AI and whether these investments are accelerating growth in its cloud computing segment.

In response to the strong performance, Roblox raised its financial guidance for the upcoming quarter. The company's CEO, David Baszucki, attributed the growth to strategic investments in infrastructure and the platform's creator ecosystem, stating a goal of capturing 10% of the global gaming market.

          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity, financial experts are cautioning against several common and costly mistakes. With interest rates remaining firm, borrowers are advised to carefully choose between a variable-rate HELOC and a fixed-rate home equity loan, depending on their need for payment predictability. The article also warns against borrowing more than necessary, as over-leveraging can become risky if financial circumstances change. Finally, homeowners should be mindful of hidden closing costs and fees, which can significantly increase the overall cost of the loan if not properly scrutinized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the increasing number of emergency appeals reaching the court, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he attributed the rise to presidents increasingly using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which in turn leads to more legal challenges. Kavanaugh defended the court's process, noting that it has made internal changes to handle these cases, including scheduling emergency oral arguments. He expressed a belief in the collegiality of the court, stating that even in disagreement, the justices are patriots engaging thoughtfully with difficult issues and that criticism is part of the job.</p>
