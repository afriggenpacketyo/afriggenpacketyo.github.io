          <p>In an increasingly competitive job market, applicants are using artificial intelligence tools to create professional headshots at a fraction of the cost of traditional photography. Services like InstaHeadshots and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for platforms like LinkedIn, with some users reporting a significant increase in recruiter outreach after updating their photos. However, the trend raises ethical questions about authenticity, as career experts and recruiters express concerns that poorly done AI images can appear inauthentic.

          <p>The prestigious Grand Sumo Tournament is being held in London, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that the event has taken place outside of Japan. London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting over 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, for five days of competition, requiring intricate logistical preparations, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring (dohyo). The event highlights the deep cultural and religious traditions of sumo, which is interwoven with the Shinto religion. Organizers are providing English commentary to help the largely Western audience understand the sport's complex rules and rituals.</p>

          <p>In response to rising suicide rates and systemic barriers to care, community-led mental health groups are emerging to create safe spaces for Black men to discuss their emotional well-being. Organizations like "Mental Health Is Real Wealth" in Los Angeles host meetings where men can be vulnerable without judgment, addressing pressures to appear strong and the unique challenges they face. These groups serve as a crucial gateway to therapy, as Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often receive culturally incompetent care when they do. The initiative aims to break generational cycles and foster healthier emotional expression.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate debt-free, advises prospective college students on how to successfully secure financial aid. She identifies three major mistakes applicants make: applying for overly broad national scholarships, not applying to enough scholarships, and failing to market themselves effectively in essays. Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships that have narrower criteria, which reduces the competition pool. She also suggests that students should treat the process as a numbers game, recommending applying for 100 to 200 scholarships to maximize their chances of success.</p>

          <p>The German phrase 'Das crazy,' a blend of German and English, has been named the Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The expression, which intentionally breaks grammatical rules, is used by young people to convey surprise, speechlessness, or irony, particularly in online chats and on social media. The selection was made through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, which received two million participants. The choice highlights the growing influence of English on youth language and a trend towards brevity, reflecting how language evolves in digital and everyday communication.</p>

Starboard, known for its operational expertise, is expected to push for board representation and help restore investor confidence during this transitional period.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health and future success. To prepare for this, she recommends two key actions starting in late elementary school: education and setting firm rules. Parents should proactively teach children about online safety, privacy, and the value of their time away from screens. Once a device is introduced, Twenge stresses the importance of establishing clear boundaries, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls to manage usage and content.</p>

He describes the first category, currency-denominated assets like bonds, as a bet on government stability that typically loses value over time. The second, non-productive assets like gold, rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future without creating any intrinsic value. Buffett states his preference for the third category: productive assets, such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on the output they can generate, making them a more rational and tangible investment.</p>

The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women and that remarried households often have a higher median net worth than those of divorced, single adults. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the phenomenon of "gray divorce" among those over 50 remains a notable exception, though its rate has recently leveled off.

          <p>This article argues that the "cringe" or earnest idealism of the anti-Trump Resistance movement, often dismissed by cynics, is actually a potent political tool against authoritarianism. While the movement's aesthetics, like pink hats, were mocked during Trump's first term, its on-the-ground organizing led to concrete victories, such as the 2018 midterm "blue wave." As the "No Kings" protests gain momentum during Trump's second term, the article posits that sincere, community-based action is an effective antidote to the nihilism and cynicism that authoritarianism thrives on. It suggests that embracing earnestness, while focusing on local, practical organizing, is the most effective form of opposition.</p>
