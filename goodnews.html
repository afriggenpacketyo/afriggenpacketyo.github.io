          <p>Apple and Formula 1 have announced a five-year media rights deal, effective 2026, granting Apple TV exclusive U.S. streaming rights for all F1 events, including practice, qualifying, and Sprint sessions. This agreement, reportedly worth about $140 million per year, significantly surpasses ESPN's previous $85 million annual deal, marking Apple's strategic expansion into live sports broadcasting. The ad-free coverage will be integrated into Apple's existing $12.99 monthly subscription, and the popular F1 TV Premium will now be included with an Apple TV subscription. This move, partly influenced by the success of "F1: The Movie," underscores Apple's commitment to delivering a unique and controlled user experience for racing fans while maximizing F1's growth potential in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK government has failed in its attempt to block an appeal against its decision to ban Palestine Action under terrorism laws, with the Court of Appeal paving the way for a High Court review next month. Palestine Action's co-founder, Huda Ammori, successfully argued for a faster judicial review process, circumventing the government's preferred, lengthier internal appeal route. The ban, implemented on July 5th, criminalizes support for the direct action group, leading to over 2,100 arrests. The ruling is significant as it allows an immediate challenge to the lawfulness of the ban, potentially impacting criminal charges against supporters, despite the Home Office maintaining the group remains proscribed due to alleged criminal damage and intimidation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from proceeding with layoffs of federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown, now in its third week. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston criticized the cuts as seemingly politically motivated and hastily implemented, creating an intolerable "human cost." The administration, through the White House Office of Management and Budget, had begun issuing layoff notices, potentially impacting over 10,000 employees, as a strategy to pressure Democratic lawmakers amidst the budget standoff. This judicial decision came in response to a request from federal labor unions, who contended the firings constituted an illegal abuse of power designed to punish workers and influence congressional negotiations over healthcare demands.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to hold a phone conversation with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, focusing on ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China. This high-level dialogue is seen as a potential step towards easing tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, which recently escalated following President Trump's threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's new export controls. Trump himself has indicated that while such tariffs are not sustainable, they were prompted by Chinese actions, and also announced an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Secretary Bessent, who holds "great respect" for Vice Premier He, had earlier expressed a strong likelihood of traveling to Asia for discussions before the presidential summit, underscoring the critical nature of these economic talks.

          <p>Meta has announced new AI parental controls, set to roll out early next year, allowing parents to monitor and manage their teenagers' interactions with AI characters on its platforms. These features include the ability to disable one-on-one AI chats, block specific AI characters, and gain insight into conversation topics. This move follows a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into how AI chatbots could harm children and teenagers, especially after reports surfaced of Meta's chatbots engaging in inappropriate romantic conversations with minors. Meta previously updated its policies to prevent AI bots from discussing self-harm or inappropriate romantic subjects with teens, and these new controls aim to further enhance child safety.</p>

          <p>Forty years ago, Lynette Woodard made history by becoming the first woman to join the iconic Harlem Globetrotters basketball team in 1985. A celebrated University of Kansas star and captain of the 1984 Olympic gold medal-winning Team USA, Woodard was selected after a nationwide tryout, bringing her exceptional athletic abilities to the predominantly male squad. Inspired by her cousin, former Globetrotter Hubert "Geese" Ausbie, she fulfilled a childhood dream. Woodard played for two years before continuing her career in professional basketball in Italy and Japan, and later in the WNBA's inaugural season. Her trailblazing achievement continues to inspire, with five women now playing for the Globetrotters, cementing her enduring legacy in sports and women's athletics.</p>

The article emphasizes that the United States must simultaneously protect its strategic interests and actively strive to prevent the competition from reaching "extreme and dangerous levels of tension." Researchers suggest that certain statements from Chinese leaders are less confrontational than commonly depicted, implying an "opening" for a form of coexistence. The core challenge lies in effectively leveraging this potential to foster mutual understanding and manage the inherent competition without it devolving into outright conflict.</p>

This issue may prevent camera images from displaying correctly under certain lighting conditions, thereby increasing the risk of a crash for drivers. While Ford has reviewed customer complaints and warranty data, identifying 10 reports, the automaker has confirmed no accidents or injuries have been directly linked to this condition. To rectify the problem, dealers will update the image processing module software free of charge, with interim notification letters dispatched to vehicle owners this month and final remedy details expected by March 2026.</p>

Murayama is notably remembered for his landmark 1995 statement, issued on the 50th anniversary of World War II's end, in which he expressed "deep remorse" for Japan's wartime actions. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian specifically highlighted Murayama's historic visit to the Marco Polo Bridge in 1995, a site considered the starting point of Japan's full-scale war with China in 1937. His efforts and contributions to fostering improved China-Japan friendship are acknowledged as a significant and positive aspect of his political legacy.</p>

          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings asserts that the U.S. banking system and private credit markets remain sound, despite recent worries over bad loans at midsize banks. Marc Pinto, head of global private credit, dismisses concerns about widespread contagion, stating there's no evidence of a credit cycle turn or significant deterioration in asset quality. This assessment comes after bank stocks sold off following disclosures of bad loans by Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's "one cockroach" warning. Pinto highlights relatively low default rates on high-yield debt and a stronger-than-expected U.S. economy, suggesting credit quality is currently in a good place. (not investment advice)</p>

A Duke University study suggests flexibility policies could add over 100GW of capacity, equivalent to 50 Hoover Dams.

          <p>As hundreds of millions of birds migrate south, they face an invisible and deadly threat: collisions with glass windows, which kill an estimated one billion birds annually in the U.S. Evolution has not prepared birds for transparent or reflective glass, leading them to mistake it for open sky or habitat. While the Trump administration has weakened federal protections for migratory birds, a new Bird Collision Prevention Alliance, comprising over a hundred organizations, is working on science-based solutions. Effective treatments, like dot-pattern films demonstrated at Chicago's McCormick Place, can reduce collisions by 95%, offering hope for scalable solutions in both commercial buildings and homes to mitigate this significant environmental challenge.</p>

Certified financial planners emphasize the importance of understanding ETF expense ratios, as even small differences can accumulate into significant lost money over time.

While homicides are declining in many major U.S. cities, including Manhattan, gun violence remains a persistent issue, disproportionately affecting Black and Latino communities.
