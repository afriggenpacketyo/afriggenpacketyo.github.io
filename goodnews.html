          <h2>Portugal's Center-Right Coalition Maintains Lead Amidst Far-Right Surge in Elections</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portugal's recent snap elections saw the center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) emerge victorious, but the far-right Chega party made significant gains, disrupting the country's traditional bipartisan dominance. The AD secured just under a third of the votes, winning 89 of the 230 seats in the National Assembly, while Chega tied with the Socialists at 58 seats. The outcome reflects a broader rightward trend across Europe, similar to recent polls in Germany. The future of Portugal's government remains uncertain, with a minority AD government seeming most likely, though there are increasing calls for cooperation between the center-left and center-right parties to ensure stability. </p>

McCullum described captain Ben Stokes as the "most ruthless" sportsperson he has ever met, highlighting his drive to push himself and his teammates to win at all costs. The team will focus on the five-Test series against India and the Ashes, while also respecting their upcoming match against Zimbabwe.</p>

          <p>The historic U.S. Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles is being offered for sale by the General Services Administration as part of a plan to reduce the federal government's real estate holdings. The 14-story Art Moderne building, which once housed the main post office, is on the National Register of Historic Places and has hosted notable cases, including Mendez vs. Westminster. While the GSA did not list a price, commercial property brokers estimate it could sell for around $60 million. The sale has sparked concern among some, who believe the government is rushing to sell the building without considering its historical significance and potential future use.</p>

          <p>Researchers in the United States are deploying specially trained dogs to detect the eggs of the invasive spotted lanternfly. These leaf-hopping pests, harmless to humans but damaging to trees and fruit crops, have spread across the East coast and into the Midwest. Four dogs are currently scouring parks in the Cleveland area, having already uncovered more than 4,000 egg masses, potentially eradicating as many as 200,000 insects. The dogs were trained through a research project led by Virginia Tech University, with the aim of slowing the spread of the spotted lanternflies.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts have provided information about the disease, including its signs, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in American men, and while early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms, advanced stages can lead to problems with urination, erectile dysfunction, and pain. Screening tests, such as PSA tests and digital rectal exams, can help detect prostate cancer early, increasing the odds of successful treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the cancer and how far it has spread, and can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's actions to take over and dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The judge ordered the reinstatement of the USIP's acting president, calling the officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed." The ruling emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the president's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The USIP, an independent nonprofit group created by Congress, has worked for 40 years to promote conflict resolution globally.</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as an opportunity to look forward and find practical solutions that benefit the British people. The Conservatives and Reform UK have criticized the deal as a "surrender" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats have described it as positive first steps.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given believes that Jack Grealish may need to leave the club this summer due to limited playing time. Grealish, who joined City for ¬£100m in 2021, has seen his role diminish this season, starting only 16 times. Given argues that Grealish is a generational talent who is not being properly utilized and suggests that a move to a club where he can play regularly would benefit his career. Defeat in the FA Cup final means that City will finish without a major trophy for the first time since Guardiola's first season in charge in 2016-17.</p>
