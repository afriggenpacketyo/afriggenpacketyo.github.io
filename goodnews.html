          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri narrowly claimed pole position for the Dutch Grand Prix, edging out his teammate and championship rival Lando Norris by just 0.012 seconds. Both drivers set their fastest times during their initial laps in the final qualifying session at Zandvoort. The result intensifies the close battle between the two, with Piastri holding a nine-point lead in the championship standings. Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified in third, while Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls delivered a standout performance to secure fourth place, marking a career-best qualifying result for the rookie driver.</p>

During his trip, he met with officials from the Treasury and Commerce Departments, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative's office. According to China's commerce ministry, the discussions focused on bilateral economic relations and the implementation of previous agreements reached during trade negotiations.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to $1 billion after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The odds of matching all six numbers to claim the jackpot are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity for the full amount or a lump-sum cash option, which is valued at just under half the advertised prize. All winnings are subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to applicable state taxes on lottery prizes.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have uncovered 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, due to receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe, ongoing drought plaguing the country has exposed archaeological sites that were previously submerged. The tombs, which date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period, were found in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation. The archaeological team is working to excavate and preserve the tombs before water levels rise again.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly unwilling to include defender Joe Gomez in a loan deal as part of their effort to sign Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace had explored the possibility of taking Gomez on loan to facilitate the transfer of Guehi to the Premier League champions. Sources suggest Palace might accept a deal around £30 million plus the loan, but Liverpool has no intention of letting Gomez depart temporarily. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, putting pressure on Palace to sell him before his contract expires next summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has dropped several requirements and milestones that Intel was originally obligated to meet under the CHIPS Act. This change comes after the government decided to take a 10 percent equity stake in the company instead of proceeding with the original grant-based deal. According to a company filing, Intel no longer has to share a percentage of cash flow from funded projects and is exempt from certain workflow policies. The new agreement converts a planned $5.7 billion grant into part of an $8.9 billion stock purchase by the government, a deal finalized after a meeting between President Trump and Intel's CEO.

          <p>Anthony D. Fredericks, a 78-year-old retired education professor and prolific author, attributes his sharp memory to five intentional daily habits. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress and depression, which can contribute to memory loss. He also advocates for lifelong learning by reading widely outside one's expertise to stay curious and mentally engaged. His other key practices include using an organizational system like color-coded notes, engaging in daily physical activity to increase blood flow to the brain, and maintaining a healthy diet with proper hydration and at least seven hours of sleep.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean rowed over 9,000 miles non-stop from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to complete the full crossing from South America. During their journey, they faced severe weather, injuries, and even a moment when one brother was swept overboard. The trio also successfully raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar through their charity, the Maclean Foundation, breaking the previous record of 160 days set in 2014.</p>

          <p>According to a new ranking from The Princeton Review, Princeton University offers the best return on investment (ROI) among private colleges in the United States. Despite a high sticker price, the average student receiving financial aid pays just over $10,500 per year and goes on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The rankings considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and post-graduation earnings. Other top institutions for ROI include Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, many of which have generous "no-loan" financial aid policies that help students graduate with minimal debt.

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. Rexford's stock has recently traded at a substantial discount to its net asset value, attracting Elliott's attention. The activist firm is known for pushing for changes to improve shareholder value, and its engagement may lead to calls for better corporate governance, improved capital allocation, or even a strategic sale of the company. Given Rexford's premium assets and the consolidation trend in the REIT sector, the company is considered a natural acquisition target. (not investment advice)</p>

Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna of the Michelin-starred Junoon and the popular Bungalow are leading a movement to present more authentic, regionally specific Indian food. This trend is supported by a growing consumer interest in global flavors and an increasingly affluent Indian American population. As a result, investor interest is rising, with private equity firms like L Catterton recently backing the popular U.K. chain Dishoom ahead of its planned U.S. expansion.</p>
