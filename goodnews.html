          <p>British qualifier Oliver "Ollie" Tarvet, ranked 733rd, is preparing for his second-round Wimbledon match against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. The 21-year-old US college student, making his Grand Slam debut, views the match as an opportunity rather than just an experience, maintaining quiet confidence. His journey from a family home near a tennis center to American college tennis, a popular route for British players, highlights his dedication.

          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, announced that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after his death, ending years of speculation. He affirmed that the Gaden Phodrang Trust will have the sole authority to recognize his future reincarnation, in accordance with tradition, explicitly excluding external interference. This decision is significant given China's past attempts to exert control over the succession. The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959, is a global symbol of non-violence, and his announcement aims to preserve the spiritual lineage independent of Beijing's influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese EV startup Xpeng has maintained steady sales, delivering over 30,000 cars for the eighth consecutive month, defying China's intense EV price war. This performance contrasts with mixed results from rivals like Zeekr, Nio, and Li Auto, and puts pressure on Tesla, whose Q2 China sales are projected to decline. The price war has drawn government criticism for "involution," or excessive competition. While Xiaomi's new SUV garnered significant orders, its delivery backlog indicates potential scalping.

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from revoking their legal status and work permits before February 2026, as previously extended by the Biden administration. The judge sided with Haitian migrants who sued, stating Noem lacked the authority to partially vacate the TPS designation prematurely. The White House plans to appeal, arguing district courts cannot prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>
