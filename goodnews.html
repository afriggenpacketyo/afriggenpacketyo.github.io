          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. This continues a significant lull in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive deportation policies and the halt of migrant releases. The figures represent a stark reversal from the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, with officials noting that daily crossings once surpassed this new monthly total. The administration's approach includes swift deportations, increased military presence, and large-scale interior arrests by ICE.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted one of Europe's strictest anti-smoking laws, banning smoking in numerous public spaces including beaches, parks, and near schools to "denormalize" the habit. The government aims to combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths, which claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. Violators of the new rules face fines up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public venues since 2008, this expansion targets outdoor areas, leaving caf√© terraces as one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. The deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would provide a window to work towards a permanent end to the conflict, which has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties. This development comes ahead of a planned meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It remains unclear whether Hamas will agree to the terms, as previous negotiations have stalled over demands for a permanent truce.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the bill while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to local water contamination from a 3M plant. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony before lawmakers was a key catalyst for the legislation, which passed shortly after her death at age 20.</p>

Cramer noted that Meta's performance was bolstered by a blowout quarterly earnings report, showcasing the strength of its advertising business.

          <p>The Bank of England is planning the first major redesign of its banknotes in over 50 years and is asking the public for input on potential new themes. The current practice of featuring notable historical figures like Winston Churchill could be replaced with subjects such as nature, innovation, architecture, or key historical events. This move could bring UK currency in line with notes from other countries that feature animals or landmarks. The Bank's chief cashier stated the goal is to create "little pieces of art" that serve as a symbolic representation of the UK's collective national identity.</p>

The club fast-tracked the signing for its Club World Cup campaign, and the right-back has quickly settled in, providing a key assist in the win against Juventus. That goal alone secured an extra ¬£10m in prize money for the club, more than covering the initial transfer cost. While questions about his defensive work remain, his attacking contributions and adaptation to the team have impressed coaches and pundits.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970 law, in an effort to spur housing development. The new legislation exempts most proposed low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas from CEQA's lengthy environmental review process and the threat of lawsuits from opponents. Proponents argue this will remove a major barrier that has stifled construction and driven up housing costs for decades. The changes, which were fast-tracked as part of the state budget, represent a seismic shift in California's approach to development.</p>
