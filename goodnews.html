          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has appointed former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary in a significant front-bench reshuffle. This move places Cleverly in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and is described by Badenoch as bringing experienced "heavy hitters" back to the forefront. The reshuffle includes several other key changes, such as new appointments for shadow transport and health secretaries, aimed at strengthening the party's position. The changes come as the Conservative party struggles in the polls and seeks to renew its policy direction under Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams made a triumphant return to the court after a 16-month absence, winning her first-round doubles match at the D.C. Open with partner Hailey Baptiste. Williams, 45, who underwent a procedure for uterine fibroids last year, expressed joy at simply being able to play again, stating her health has given her a new perspective on her career. In a lighthearted moment, she jokingly blamed her sister Serena for not having teamed up with Baptiste sooner. Williams is also scheduled to compete in the singles tournament, marking a significant comeback for the seven-time major champion.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny is set to appear on both "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "Late Night With Seth Meyers" on the same night, an unusual booking for competing networks. The appearances are part of a promotional tour for his role in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2" and come during his historic 30-night concert residency in Puerto Rico. The dual booking highlights the artist's immense popularity and the evolving landscape of late-night television, where networks may be more willing to share high-profile guests. The article notes growing camaraderie among late-night hosts amid industry changes, including the recently announced cancellation of Colbert's show.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at Los Angeles International Airport discovered and seized a significant drug shipment destined for New Zealand. Nearly 300 pounds of methamphetamine were found ingeniously hidden inside fake solar panels. The agency highlighted the discovery as another example of creative smuggling attempts they regularly intercept at the major international airport. This seizure follows other recent incidents at LAX, including drugs disguised as dog shampoo and a suitcase of clothes soaked in methamphetamine, showcasing the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to combat international drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old man from Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Phillips offered to provide personal information about former Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents. However, the contacts, known as Sasha and Dima, were actually undercover British officers. The court heard that Phillips, who was described by his ex-wife as being "infatuated" with espionage, was arrested after providing a USB stick with information and meeting the officers.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, marking the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure that previously drove people to seek extra work. This shift suggests that more people are using extra income for discretionary spending rather than covering basic living expenses, indicating a potential decrease in economic anxiety.

CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to "greatly reduce" its exposure to tariffs through manufacturing adjustments and cost-saving initiatives. Despite the strong underlying performance, the ongoing trade uncertainty and its substantial financial repercussions caused the company's shares to fall in trading. (not investment advice)</p>

Before her life-saving surgery, she recorded herself saying important phrases and reading children's books, which she later used to train an AI model. The resulting AI-generated voice, stored on a phone app, replicates her unique cadence and accent, allowing her to communicate with her characteristic sarcasm and personality. After finding insurance wouldn't cover the technology, Sotinsky is now advocating for better access to voice-banking and AI tools for other patients facing similar challenges.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell is contemplating key lineup changes ahead of the second Test match against Australia in Melbourne, a game he has called "the biggest game of our lives." With a victory needed to secure the series, speculation is mounting over several positions, particularly with lock Joe McCarthy and winger Mack Hansen likely out due to injury. Key decisions loom at full-back, where Blair Kinghorn could challenge Hugo Keenan, and in the centers, where a now-fit Garry Ringrose could potentially replace Huw Jones. The selection for the bench also remains a point of significant interest as the team prepares for the high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a fee of around €73.5 million (£63.5m). While the player has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract, the completion of the transfer has been slightly delayed by negotiations over add-on payments between the two clubs. The 27-year-old striker has been a top target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is keen to add more firepower to his squad. Gyokeres had an exceptional season, scoring 54 goals in 52 appearances for the Portuguese club.</p>

          <p>Some companies are now using anonymous body heat sensors to gather data on how employees use office space, aiming to improve efficiency and create more hospitable work environments. Technology from startups like Butlr, an MIT spinoff, uses these sensors and AI to analyze occupancy, foot traffic, and meeting patterns without using cameras, thus protecting employee privacy. The data helps companies make informed decisions on office layout, hybrid work schedules, maintenance, and even lease negotiations. This trend is driven by the post-pandemic shift in work habits and a desire to optimize increasingly expensive commercial real estate.</p>
