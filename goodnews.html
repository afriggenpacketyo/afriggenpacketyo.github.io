          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after a strong fiscal second quarter, beating Wall Street expectations. The denim maker plans to absorb the initial financial impact of new U.S. tariffs, estimated at $25-$30 million, aided by strong consumer demand and reduced promotions. The company's strategy focuses on direct-to-consumer sales and expanding its women's apparel line, which has seen significant growth. Company executives expressed confidence in consumer resilience despite broader economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting "national priority vouchers," which can significantly shorten drug approval times. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced the change, aligning the program with the Trump administration's goal of lowering prescription drug costs for Americans. The vouchers are intended for companies addressing national health priorities, such as developing cures for Type 1 diabetes or a universal flu vaccine. However, questions remain about how affordability will be assessed and the potential risks of accelerating drug reviews.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. continues to threaten tariffs, analysts advise that China is shifting to a more pragmatic, long-term diplomatic and economic strategy. Instead of just issuing warnings, Beijing is focusing on strengthening ties with its own trade partners, particularly in its neighborhood, by offering tangible benefits like greater market access. This approach aims to build a more unified regional market to collectively counter U.S. trade protectionism. The strategy is seen as a way for China to fortify its position for future negotiations while projecting a firm stance against Washington's policies.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai branch of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has called on state-owned enterprises to research the potential of digital assets, including stablecoins. In a notable statement, the regulator urged these firms to study the use of blockchain for cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This directive is significant given China's strict ban on most cryptocurrency activities and reflects recent calls in state media to consider the role of yuan-backed stablecoins. The move suggests a growing interest in leveraging digital currencies to enhance the yuan's global standing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine through a NATO-facilitated arrangement. Under the new deal, the U.S. will provide the systems to NATO, which will then distribute them to Ukraine, with NATO members reimbursing the cost. The announcement followed a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for at least 10 Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian missile and drone attacks. This move signals a significant reinforcement of support for Ukraine's defense capabilities amid escalating aerial bombardments.</p>

          <p>IMAX is poised for its best year ever at the global box office, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting a record $1.2 billion in revenue. The company is benefiting from a post-pandemic consumer shift towards premium, event-style experiences, with several major films this year earning over 20% of their total gross from IMAX screenings alone. This success is driven by exclusive releases and films shot with IMAX's proprietary cameras, a strategy that attracts both filmmakers and audiences. With a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters and plans to build 500 new theaters, the company's growth trajectory appears strong.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment. Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which propelled the cryptocurrency's rally. The momentum was also linked to expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and the potential economic impact of new government spending legislation. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in liquidations of short positions, further accelerating the upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>
