          <p>British television personality Davina McCall is engaged to her partner of seven years, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas. The news was confirmed by her representative and comes several months after the 57-year-old presenter announced that a benign brain tumor she had surgically removed last year was not returning. McCall, a well-known host of shows like "Big Brother," has been public about her health journey, including the craniotomy she underwent in November. She and Douglas, who met professionally in the early 2000s, began their relationship in 2018 and have shared updates on her recovery with the public.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is advocating for a potential merger between Performance Food Group (PFG) and its competitor, US Foods. The firm has nominated four candidates to PFG's board to encourage exploration of the business combination, citing significant potential synergies that could reach up to $1 billion annually. Sachem Head argues that a merger of the second and third largest players in the foodservice distribution industry could create substantial value for shareholders. The activist push comes at a time of potential leadership transition at PFG, which could create an opportune moment for a strategic transaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares in mid-August, but the investment may still be in the red. Because Berkshire's buying occurred during the second quarter when the stock price fluctuated significantly, it is unclear if the current price of $352.51 represents a paper gain or loss. Depending on the exact purchase price, Berkshire's position could range from a 42% loss to a 42% gain. Despite this uncertainty, analysts remain bullish on the stock's long-term prospects, with Morgan Stanley recently raising its price target for the healthcare giant. (not investment advice)</p>

Initially given an 80% chance of dying within five years, she has navigated four years of continuous treatment, including aggressive chemotherapy and clinical trials that have successfully managed tumors in her brain. Despite the harsh side effects, Kalver has focused on prioritizing her quality of life and making a positive impact. She founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, has written a book, and works as an advocate, embodying a philosophy of living fully while managing a chronic illness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market research indicates that convenience stores are gaining a significant share of the breakfast market, traditionally dominated by fast-food restaurants. While morning traffic to fast-food chains saw a minor increase, visits to food-forward convenience stores climbed by 9% in a recent three-month period. This trend is driven by chains like Wawa and Casey's expanding their fresh food offerings, which consumers perceive as a good value and a viable alternative to quick-service restaurants. The shift highlights how budget-conscious diners are changing their habits, impacting major players like McDonald's, which has noted breakfast as its most economically sensitive daypart.</p>

          <p>A humorous opinion piece critiques the cyclical nature of fashion trends, specifically targeting the rumored resurgence of skinny jeans. The author argues against the constant pressure from the fashion industry and media to adopt new styles, which often just means repurchasing items that were deemed outdated only a few years prior. He contends that individuals should prioritize personal comfort and style over chasing fleeting trends, noting that skinny jeans are unflattering for many body types. The article frames the fashion cycle as a wasteful and creatively stagnant process driven by consumerism, urging readers to resist the discourse and wear what makes them feel good.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of OpenAI is having a profound economic impact across the tech industry, with companies like Oracle, Broadcom, Microsoft, and Nvidia seeing their market values soar due to massive contracts with the AI leader. Oracle's stock recently experienced a historic surge after revealing that a significant portion of its $455 billion in performance obligations is tied to a multi-year cloud computing deal with OpenAI. This trend highlights OpenAI's central role in the current AI boom, as its immense capital expenditures on chips and cloud infrastructure directly fuel the revenue of its key suppliers, contributing significantly to the rally in the broader tech market.

          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for securing cheap airfare is maintaining flexibility with travel dates. Data analysis shows that flying midweek—on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is typically 13% less expensive than traveling on weekends. Shifting travel plans by even a day or two can result in significant savings, as can traveling during a destination's shoulder season or off-season rather than during peak times. The article debunks the myth that booking on a specific day of the week matters, emphasizing that the day of travel is far more important for finding a good deal.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group (CWG), a controversial panel of climate change skeptics. The group authored a report that was widely criticized by the scientific community for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science, prompting a lawsuit from environmental organizations. The lawsuit alleged the group was formed in secret and violated federal law by exclusively including authors with a single viewpoint. The CWG's report had been used by the EPA to support efforts to roll back regulations on climate pollution, a key part of the Trump administration's environmental policy agenda.</p>

          <p>Accessing a COVID-19 vaccine has become more complicated this year, as the FDA has narrowed its approval to specific high-risk groups, including individuals 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions. This marks a significant policy shift from previous years when the vaccine was available to nearly everyone. As a result, many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies unless they can self-attest to having a risk factor. The article provides a guide to the current eligibility criteria, which includes a broad range of conditions like asthma, diabetes, and mental health issues, and explains the logistical challenges some may face in obtaining a shot.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East German urban architecture. The show, titled "Wohnkomplex," examines these buildings not just as architectural artifacts but as symbols of socialist utopian ideals that later became sites of painful social transformation after German reunification. The exhibition showcases artworks that reflect the collective memory of life in these housing complexes, which housed nearly a quarter of the GDR's population. It also delves into the darker period of the 1990s, when high unemployment in these areas contributed to a rise in far-right extremism.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles twelve influential Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a bygone era of optimism in bilateral relations. The volume, co-edited by scholars Deborah Davis and Terry Lautz, includes figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts who played key roles in fostering exchange after 1979. The editors argue that both countries have lost sight of their shared interests as the relationship has spiraled into intense competition and distrust. The book serves as a reminder of the mutual benefits that once arose from cooperation, a perspective that has become increasingly rare in the current geopolitical climate.</p>
