        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan and the United States have committed to accelerating tariff negotiations, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement potentially by June, signaling progress in expanding bilateral trade relations. Following discussions in Washington, both nations plan to hold intensive ministerial talks starting in mid-May, addressing contentious issues at the working level. While Japan emphasizes protecting its national interests, the agreement seeks to deepen cooperation on non-tariff barriers and economic security. Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump may discuss the deal during the G7 summit in Canada in June, with Japan considering increased purchases of US corn and soybeans to aid in trade balance.</p>

          <p>Jeopardy! host Ken Jennings, who famously competed against IBM's Watson in 2011, voiced his skepticism about current artificial intelligence, stating that while modern LLMs would outperform Watson at Jeopardy!, he still prefers content created by human minds. Jennings highlighted the fear of AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, a concern that was prominent during the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023. He also relayed musician will.i.am's sentiment that artists who focus on creative expression rather than chasing algorithms have little to fear from AI, as AI is best suited to mimic existing creations.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections, winning its first Parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby by a narrow margin, as well as securing its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire.

Reform UK also won more than half of the first 100 council seats declared, indicating a rising vote share of about 38%, while the Conservatives faced heavy losses across the country, with the Liberal Democrats also targeting councils in the south.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered the obesity drug market with a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand Pharma's petrelintide, an amylin analog, aiming to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, differing from prevalent GLP-1 drugs. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability and muscle preservation. The deal includes upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments up to $5.3 billion. Zealand will co-develop petrelintide with Roche's incretin asset CT-388, with Phase 2b trial results expected in summer 2026.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move expected to have major socio-economic and political consequences. The decision, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, signals a commitment to the values and interests of the society and country. This count is likely to lead to demands for increased quotas in government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for lower and intermediate castes, known as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The announcement comes months before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue, and follows similar surveys already released by two other states.</p>
