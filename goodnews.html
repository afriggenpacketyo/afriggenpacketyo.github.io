        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration raid protests, deeming the move "illegal." Judge Charles Breyer ordered the administration to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, citing a failure to follow congressionally mandated procedures and a violation of the Tenth Amendment. Newsom criticized the militarization of city streets, emphasizing the military's place on the battlefield, not in civilian affairs. The judge noted that the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify federal deployment, highlighting the threat to First Amendment rights and the constitutional balance of power.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. This domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred in ancient society, marking a significant development in the region's history.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, one of golf's rarest scores, during the first round of the US Open, holing his second shot from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole. Reed raised his hands in surprise as the ball bounced three times and rolled into the cup. This marks just the fourth albatross at the US Open since records began in 1983. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, concluding with a triple bogey on the final hole.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning has commenced for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, drawing significant attention as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats amidst sluggish approval ratings. Parties, including the LDP, Komeito, and Tomin First no Kai, are actively utilizing social media to engage voters. Key issues include support for households facing rising costs, political funding scandals, and regional concerns such as child-rearing and heatÂØæÁ≠ñ.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are intensifying their overseas expansion efforts as a means of navigating trade tariffs imposed by the United States. Despite a temporary truce in the trade war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to substantial tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production bases, with a growing emphasis on establishing facilities in the Middle East, Africa, the US, and Europe. Executives at China's largest solar industry exhibition emphasized that localizing production abroad is crucial for the long-term survival of these companies.</p>

          <p>A Taiwanese court sentenced a Chinese captain to three years in prison for damaging an undersea cable connecting Taiwan's main island to the Penghu island group in February. The court found that the captain of the Hong Tai 58, sailing under a Togolese flag with a crew of eight mainland Chinese, instructed crew members to release the ship's anchor near the undersea cable. The vessel was also found to have sailed in a zigzag pattern, leading to the cable damage.</p>

          <p>A novel "Trojan horse" therapy, which delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, will be available on the NHS in England, marking a world-first. This treatment, known as belantamab mafodotin, has demonstrated the ability to halt the progression of the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies. The drug works by binding to cancerous plasma cells and releasing a lethal chemotherapy drug inside. Clinical trials have shown that the therapy can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments.</p>
