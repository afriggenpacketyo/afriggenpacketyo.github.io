          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a retirement portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make the funds last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential withdrawals from a traditional investment portfolio. This comparison helps retirees evaluate trade-offs between the security and longevity protection of an annuity and the flexibility and inflation-adjusted potential of market investments.
