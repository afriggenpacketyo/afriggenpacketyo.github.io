          <p>A tribute from former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky celebrates the life and career of correspondent Mark Knoller, who passed away. Knoller was renowned for his 32-year tenure at CBS, where he became the unofficial statistician of the White House, meticulously tracking presidential activities across eight administrations. Revered by colleagues and presidents from both parties, he was remembered for his encyclopedic knowledge, distinctive radio voice, and selfless, generous character. His work provided an invaluable historical record of the American presidency.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Confirm 'Selective Hearing' as a Genuine Neurological Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research confirms that "selective hearing" is not a conscious choice but a real neurological function known as auditory selective attention. This cognitive process allows the brain to filter out background noise and focus on specific sounds, such as a single voice in a crowded room. Audiologists explain that the brain's auditory and prefrontal cortices work together to prioritize important auditory information, which can become more difficult with age-related hearing loss. While occasional zoning out is normal, persistent difficulty could indicate underlying hearing issues.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs. After losing control of his music catalog following the band's breakup in 1972, a long legal battle ensued, during which he stopped performing his own hits. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, Fogerty recently bought back the rights to his songs and recorded the new album with his sons, who are part of his touring band, allowing him to finally reclaim his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly in Scotland. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 frigates designed to operate jointly in northern Europe, enhancing defense cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Comedian Jim Gaffigan Laments the Overwhelming Bounty of His Summer Garden</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan shares his annual struggle with an overabundant summer garden, specifically an uncontrollable surplus of cucumbers. He recounts his initial gardening ambitions in May, followed by a misguided attempt at "succession planting" that resulted in a relentless wave of produce. After exhausting options like salads and pickles, he finds himself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of cucumbers. Gaffigan humorously concludes that despite his best intentions each year, he consistently proves he is not a farmer, but rather a man desperate to give away vegetables.</p>

          <p>Neurosurgeon and author Dr. Sanjay Gupta is highlighting new research that identifies the brain as a primary source of chronic pain, a condition affecting millions of Americans. In his new book, he explores how the brain can "memorize" pain signals, leading to persistent suffering even without a clear physical cause. The article features a patient with a rare pain syndrome who found relief through a groundbreaking clinical trial using deep brain stimulation to interrupt these pain signals before they reach consciousness. This innovative approach suggests a future where pain can be managed by targeting its neural origins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building genuine cooperation with children relies on creating emotional safety. Instead of focusing on immediate obedience, parents can use specific phrases that validate a child's feelings and calm their nervous system. Phrases like "I believe you," "Let's figure this out together," and "I'm on your side" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. This approach helps children feel heard and respected, which makes them more naturally inclined to listen and engage in problem-solving with their parents.</p>

          <p>A personal essay explores the complex, often misunderstood world of hunting from the perspective of a self-described liberal. The author argues that hunting is a more honest, sustainable, and humane way to consume meat compared to factory farming, forcing a direct confrontation with the life-and-death reality of food. The piece addresses the cultural stigma against hunting, particularly on the political left, while highlighting its deep connection to conservation, wildlife management, and a more profound relationship with nature. The author suggests that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground on food ethics than either group might realize.</p>

White expressed initial anxieties about portraying the iconic musician, citing the intimate connection Springsteen has with his fans and his own lack of musical experience. He found a connection with the role through the shared feeling of fraudulence that Springsteen was experiencing at that point in his life. The actor received the crucial approval of Springsteen himself, who was significantly involved in the film's production.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, sheds light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a nearby military school and decided to surf the local waves. They crafted boards from local redwood, replicating the giant boards they used back home, and demonstrated the "royal sport" to amazed locals. This event, documented in a local newspaper, planted the seed for surfing culture in America 140 years ago.</p>

The small, iconic packets, common in sushi takeaways, will be prohibited from sale or distribution starting Monday. While the containers are made of recyclable plastic, their small size prevents them from being processed correctly by recycling machinery. This move builds on previous legislation that banned other single-use plastics and is part of the government's strategy to protect marine life and reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the moral dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering. The author draws on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is natural to feel the pain of others. However, these same traditions also advocate for feeling "sympathetic joy" or the happiness of others. The article argues against becoming fixated on either despair or forced positivity, concluding that experiencing both joy and sorrow is part of being a connected human, and allowing oneself to feel good can be a form of resistance.</p>
