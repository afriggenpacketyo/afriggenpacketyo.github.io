          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in fashion for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue. While she will continue in her powerful roles as Vogue's global editorial director and Cond√© Nast's chief content officer, the U.S. publication will hire a new head of editorial content. This change aligns the U.S. edition's structure with other international versions of the magazine. Wintour, who has been editor-in-chief since 1988, will now focus more on her global and corporate responsibilities.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government has found "the right balance" on welfare reforms after making concessions to his own party's MPs. The initial plan aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce spending, but it faced a significant backbench rebellion. The government has now amended the bill so the stricter criteria will only apply to new claimants, not existing ones. While this move has satisfied many rebels, some MPs still intend to vote against the proposals.</p>

          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, invite-only launch for its robotaxi service in Austin, with varied results. While some participants, like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, praised the vehicles' smooth performance and maneuverability, others reported significant issues. These problems included a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping abruptly in traffic. The event highlights the ongoing debate about Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomy, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar for navigation.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have confirmed an agreement to speed up shipments of rare earth minerals to the U.S., a key development in ongoing trade negotiations. The deal, which builds on a previous consensus reached in London, involves China reviewing and approving export permits while the U.S. eases some restrictive measures. This breakthrough addresses a major point of contention, as Chinese curbs on these critical minerals had disrupted supply chains for vital industries like automotive and defense. The news has been met with cautious optimism in financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Verstappen is under contract with Red Bull until 2028, but it is rumored to contain break clauses. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are being influenced by the team's pursuit of the Dutch driver. A move could be appealing for Verstappen due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes's potential advantage with new engine regulations in 2026.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are divided on the wisdom of purchasing whole life insurance for children. Proponents argue it locks in low premiums and guarantees future insurability, which can be valuable if a child later develops a health condition. It also provides a death benefit that can ease financial stress in the event of a tragedy. However, critics point out that the statistical need for it is very low and that the cash value component often yields poor returns compared to other investment vehicles like a 529 plan or a brokerage account.
