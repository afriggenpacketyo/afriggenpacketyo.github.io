          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first direct images of a planet outside our solar system, identified as TWA 7b. This potential exoplanet, orbiting the young star TWA 7, is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, a technique crucial for detecting such objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet, potentially young, cold, and shaping its surrounding debris disk.</p>

Pritzker outlined future goals focused on education, housing affordability, and mental healthcare access. While facing speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, he stated his current focus is solely on governing Illinois.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to scale back its proposed welfare reforms following significant opposition from over 100 of its own backbench MPs. Sources suggest a deal has been reached to protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts. The planned changes, which aimed to save ¬£5 billion annually, were part of the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill. This move represents a major climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons on the legislation.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with high credit card balances and interest rates, debt forgiveness programs can seem like an appealing solution. However, this article advises taking several preliminary steps before committing to such a plan. It suggests first making a realistic assessment of whether the service is truly necessary, as it can take years and damage one's credit score. The article also recommends thoroughly exploring all alternatives, such as debt management or consolidation loans, which may be more suitable. Finally, it stresses the importance of carefully researching and comparing different debt relief servicers to find a legitimate and cost-effective option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This lifestyle article offers guidance for those struggling to find romantic connections in Los Angeles, suggesting the key is to first believe that love is abundant and not a destination to be found. The author advises a practice of actively observing and documenting small acts of love and connection in everyday life to shift one's perspective. This "exposure therapy" involves appreciating the happiness of others instead of feeling jealousy, thereby raising one's own vibration. By creating moments of passion and connection, one affirms their own existence as a loving being, making them more receptive when a new partner eventually appears.</p>

          <p>Shares of backup generator company Generac are experiencing their best week since last November, with a nearly 12% gain. This surge is attributed to an oppressive heat wave across the central and eastern U.S., which has caused power outages and strained the nation's aging electrical grid. The forecast for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season is also fueling investor interest in the company. Analysts note that increased power demand, partly driven by new data centers, presents significant tailwinds for the power sector and related companies, though some caution that the utilities sector may be over-extended.

          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" reinvents the franchise as an action-comedy, moving away from the horror roots of its predecessor. The film introduces a new, more advanced military android named AMELIA, pitting two killer robots against each other in a bigger, though less scary, spectacle. The review notes that the film borrows heavily from influences like "The Terminator" but is elevated by director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor. While the plot involves a familiar AI-takeover scenario, the movie's strength lies in its comedic exploration of the strange and unpredictable nature of its human characters, as much as its robot antiheroine.</p>

As major firms like Fiserv and Mastercard begin to integrate stablecoins, and private companies like ScaleAI and SpaceX use them for global payments, traditional financial institutions are positioning themselves to enter the market.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, marking a significant step in the Trump administration's push to loosen financial regulations. The proposal would alter the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, allowing major banks to lend more freely and purchase more government bonds. This move, championed by the Fed's new Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, is seen by investors as the start of a broader rollback of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis. While proponents argue it will boost the economy, some Fed governors dissented, warning it could increase systemic risk. (not investment advice)</p>
