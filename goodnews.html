          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the international use of China's yuan is growing, narrowing the gap with the US dollar and surpassing the British pound and Japanese yen. The report highlights that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the authors also identify US-dollar-backed stablecoins as a potential disruption to this trend, posing a significant challenge to the yuan's expanding role in global finance. This article details the strategic importance China places on its currency's global standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon World zoo on the Isle of Wight has announced the successful birth of two red panda cubs, a significant event for the endangered species. The twins were born to a pair of red pandas, Xiao and Flint, who were introduced in 2024 as part of a breeding program. The zoo expressed its delight, noting that the mother is doing a fantastic job caring for the cubs, who will remain in their nest box for about three months. The birth is a positive development in the conservation efforts for red pandas, which face threats from poaching and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>Following the legalization of recreational marijuana, New Jersey has approved its first on-site cannabis consumption lounges, with three now open in South Jersey towns including Atlantic City and Merchantville. These regulated spaces allow customers aged 21 and over to consume cannabis products purchased at the adjoining dispensaries, providing a legal and safe environment. The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission hailed the move as a "major milestone" for the state's industry, addressing the needs of consumers who cannot use cannabis at home. Operators see it as a significant step for the cannabis culture, moving it into the realm of hospitality.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has become the first US state to enact a law requiring social media companies to display warning labels to users before they log on, starting in July 2026. The pop-up messages will state that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health, a measure modeled after warnings on tobacco and alcohol. Sponsored by Democratic State Rep. Zack Stephenson, the law aims to encourage more mindful online behavior, particularly among young people. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it compels speech, and has indicated it may pursue legal action to block its enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Advise Tailored Strategies for Children with Strong Cravings for Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are highlighting that some children possess a "strong food reward drive," making them more susceptible to overconsuming ultra-processed foods, which constitute nearly 70% of the average US child's caloric intake. Psychologists explain that for these children, standard advice about moderation is often ineffective, as these foods can override natural hunger and satiety signals. Experts recommend that parents of such children create a safer home environment by limiting or removing ultra-processed options altogether. Instead, they suggest allowing these foods in moderation only in social settings outside the home to foster a healthier relationship with eating.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Pete Buttigieg cautioned that the Democratic party's goal should not be to simply restore the political and institutional norms that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that the party has been "too attached to a status quo that has been failing us," and that this attachment contributed to its 2024 defeat. Buttigieg advocated for a forward-looking approach that embraces fundamental change in government institutions like the Department of Education. He also commented on the public's loss of trust in institutions, citing the enduring interest in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as an example.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its squad for the fifth and final Test match against India at The Oval. The decision provides cover for a pace attack that was reportedly exhausted after the fourth Test in Manchester. Captain Ben Stokes indicated that "fresh legs" might be necessary for the series finale, given the tight turnaround between matches. Overton, who has one previous Test cap, joins other pace bowlers in the squad as England looks to secure a series victory by avoiding defeat in the final game.</p>

          <p>Curators at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum have discovered a complete, 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian ceramic artifact. The print was found on the underside of a "soul house," a clay model of a building placed in tombs, while preparing for an exhibition. A senior Egyptologist described the find as "rare and exciting," speculating it was left by the maker who moved the object before the clay had dried. The discovery offers a direct human connection to the anonymous artisans of ancient Egypt, whose stories are often overlooked in favor of rulers.</p>

          <p>A new trade framework reached between the United States and the European Union is being viewed as a significant political win for the Trump administration, though not a total loss for Brussels. The deal sets a 15% US tariff on many EU goods, a compromise from the threatened 30% but still a major climbdown for the EU. In return, the EU has agreed to open its markets to more American exports and purchase billions in US energy and arms. The agreement, brokered with President Trump's direct involvement, reflects his administration's strategy of renegotiating major trade relationships to favor US interests. (not investment advice)</p>
