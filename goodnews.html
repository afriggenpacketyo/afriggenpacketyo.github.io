          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has affirmed that there will be no relaxation of visa rules for Indian workers or students, a statement made during a major trade delegation visit to India. The visit, aimed at promoting a recently signed UK-India trade agreement, seeks to boost investment and economic growth by making certain exports cheaper between the two nations. Despite the economic focus and calls from some sectors, Starmer emphasized that visas were not part of the trade negotiations and that his government remains focused on its policy of reducing overall immigration levels into the UK.</p>

Judge contributed four RBIs and made several critical plays, fueling the Yankees' largest-ever comeback in an elimination game.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend known as "locking in" is gaining popularity among Gen Z on platforms like TikTok, where young people commit to periods of intense focus on personal goals, often related to fitness, finance, or skill-building. This movement is seen as a reaction to the distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing their generation, including a competitive job market and the rise of AI. While it echoes millennial hustle culture, "locking in" is more focused on self-improvement rather than corporate career advancement. Critics note the performative aspect of the trend, which often involves documenting the process on the very social media platforms it aims to escape.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has voted to prohibit the use of terms like "burger" and "sausage" for marketing plant-based food products, a move championed by some agricultural groups to protect meat-related terminology. The proposal, which aims to prevent consumer confusion, has faced significant backlash from environmental groups, consumer organizations, and even major supermarkets. Critics argue that labels such as "veggie burger" are clear and help consumers navigate choices, and that the ban stifles innovation in the growing plant-based market. The final decision on the regulation will now rest with the EU's member states.</p>

Several Australian cricket figures have commented on this gap in his otherwise stellar record, but Root remains unconcerned with the external commentary. He expressed confidence in his preparation and believes that traveling without the burden of captaincy will allow him to focus on his batting. Root is optimistic about England's chances, highlighting the team's different strategic approach and potent bowling attack for this tour.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial political meeting, China's official Communist Party newspaper has published a series of opinion pieces describing the nation's economy as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier." The articles are designed to project strength and stability, asserting that China can withstand both internal and external pressures like trade protectionism and shrinking demand. The commentary emphasizes the predictability and continuity of China's long-term planning, contrasting it with what it calls wavering policies in some Western countries. The series signals a continued focus on an economic transformation towards innovation, consumption-led growth, and greener development.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a mathematics professor who was diagnosed with autism in his 30s reflects on the strengths his neurodivergence has provided him, such as persistence and attention to detail. He argues against the narrative that treats autism as a tragedy, drawing parallels to historical eugenics movements that sought to eliminate those deemed different. The author contends that conversations about "curing" autism effectively debate the existence of autistic people and ignore their valuable contributions to society. He posits that many historical figures, like Isaac Newton, likely exhibited autistic traits that were integral to their genius, making the world a better place through their unique perspectives.</p>

          <p>According to Bloomberg, Portuguese football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first billionaire in the history of the sport. The financial media firm's Billionaires Index now values the 40-year-old's net worth at $1.4 billion. This valuation is a comprehensive measure of his career earnings, extensive investment portfolio, and numerous high-value endorsement deals. The report details that Ronaldo earned over $550 million in salary alone between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by lucrative long-term sponsorships, including a deal with Nike worth nearly $18 million annually.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Preorders play a crucial role in the success of a new book, serving as a key indicator for the publishing industry. High preorder numbers signal strong consumer interest, influencing booksellers' decisions on how many copies to stock and whether to feature the book prominently in stores or online. These early sales are also aggregated and counted on the first day of release, significantly increasing the likelihood of a book debuting on a bestseller list. This initial momentum can create a snowball effect, generating further publicity and sales that are vital for an author's success.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mollick, a leading expert on AI from the Wharton School, has cautioned against trusting definitive predictions about artificial intelligence's impact on the job market, bluntly stating, "no one knows anything." Speaking at a CNBC summit, he noted that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects. Mollick advised business leaders to encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT across their organizations rather than waiting for clear answers. He stressed that leadership must engage directly with the technology to understand its potential, as waiting for IT departments or task forces to lead will result in missed opportunities.</p>

Over 1,000 personnel, along with naval vessels, helicopters, and unmanned systems, will participate in the drill, which is focused on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime security. The exercise, the sixth of its kind since 2014, aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries and enhance their ability to address non-traditional security threats. The announcement coincides with the beginning of a separate military exercise between Japan and the Philippines in the same contested region.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for their pioneering work in the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous, crystalline materials constructed from metal ions linked by organic molecules. The Nobel committee highlighted the vast potential of MOFs, which can be custom-designed for a wide range of applications. These uses include capturing carbon dioxide, harvesting water from desert air, storing toxic gases, and catalyzing chemical reactions, offering innovative solutions to significant global challenges.</p>
