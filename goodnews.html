          <p>Shao Chun Chen, a former Google employee, moved to Chiang Mai, Thailand, in late 2024 to take advantage of geographical arbitrage. He now works three hours a week as an adjunct lecturer at the National University of Singapore and earns enough to cover his living expenses in Thailand. Chen's financial independence stems from nearly a decade of investing up to half his paycheck, resulting in a seven-figure portfolio. He also earns money by creating educational content on YouTube and from his coaching business, allowing him to live comfortably in Thailand while earning a Singaporean income.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has initiated the process of selling a stake in its China business, contacting private equity firms and technology companies to explore options for growth. The move comes as Starbucks faces increasing macroeconomic and competitive pressures in China, where local players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee have gained significant market share. Starbucks currently operates over 7,750 stores in China and generated approximately $740 million in net revenue in the most recent quarter. Potential investors are expected to provide initial feedback in the coming weeks, though Starbucks may ultimately decide against a deal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This decision follows a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The new laws will permit State Owned Investors (SOIs), such as sovereign wealth funds, to acquire stakes in UK newspapers, which Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy says will protect media plurality and help publishers secure funding. Ministers determined that a 15% threshold was "the most effective, simple and proportionate approach."</p>

The governor specifically praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills designed to ease the permitting process for infill projects.

          <p>NASA engineers have successfully revived long-dormant thrusters aboard Voyager 1, the spacecraft farthest from Earth, averting a potential communications blackout. The thrusters, out of action since 2004, are crucial for maintaining the spacecraft's orientation and communication with Earth. The revival involved a risky maneuver to restart internal heaters that had failed, and the success ensures the veteran spacecraft can continue operating until it re-establishes contact next year. This "miracle save" demonstrates the ingenuity and persistence of the Voyager mission team.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, offering the strongest indication yet that the country is making progress against its drug crisis. However, this positive trend is threatened by proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. While changes in the drug supply and increased access to treatment and naloxone may be contributing factors, experts warn that the deep cuts could reverse the progress made. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, and the sustainability of the progress is uncertain.</p>
