        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union met in London to announce a new deal intended to strengthen trade and defense ties, signaling a reset in relations after Brexit. The agreement includes a defense and security partnership, extended access to fishing waters for European boats until 2038, and discussions on trade and geopolitical collaboration. The summit addresses the need for both Europe and Britain to reorient themselves in a world where the United States is perceived as a less reliable ally. The deal also aims to facilitate youth mobility and cooperation on irregular migration, marking a significant step towards a more collaborative post-Brexit future.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020.

Both sides have also agreed to work toward a deal to facilitate young people living and working across the continent, potentially including participation in the Erasmus+ education program.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 04:59:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest Beijing may not implement aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the coming quarter due to China's economic resilience against US tariffs. April's macroeconomic data indicates that the Chinese economy is holding steady. Investment banks have already raised their growth outlook for China after a tariff truce with the United States and supportive policies from China's central bank. China's industrial output and retail sales grew more than expected, while exports also beat market expectations despite tariffs from the US.</p>

          <p>Flights at Paris-Orly airport continue to face cancellations and delays following a breakdown in air traffic control systems.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Britain and the European Union hold their first summit since Brexit, analysts describe the relationship as less of a reconciliation and more of a pragmatic collaboration due to shared interests. While a majority of Britons now believe leaving the EU was a mistake, there's little appetite for reversing the decision. The summit focuses on smaller-scale issues like fishing rights and youth mobility, with larger topics like the single market and freedom of movement remaining off the table. The war in Ukraine and the Trump administration's approach to global affairs have underscored the need for renewed ties.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy.

The Chinese government acknowledged the need to further consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Automobile sales grew modestly, and the real estate sector continued to face challenges, with home prices falling at the fastest pace since last November.</p>
