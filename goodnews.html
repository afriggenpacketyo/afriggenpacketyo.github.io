          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 20:39:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta has reportedly entered a six-year agreement to spend over $10 billion on Google's cloud services, primarily for artificial intelligence infrastructure. This deal represents a significant win for Google Cloud as it competes with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for major contracts. Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta's extensive AI development needs require access to substantial cloud infrastructure, supplementing its own data centers and existing commitments with other providers. The partnership highlights the immense computational demands driving the current AI boom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly down from the previous month but still higher than economists' forecasts. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice prices, which had previously surged. However, the "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also strips out energy prices, remained steady at 3.4%. These figures arrive as the central bank monitors persistent price pressures while the national economy shows signs of slowing export growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, Chad Raines, has successfully transitioned from struggling with unprofitable crops to a thriving business in solar grazing. He rents out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawnmowers for large-scale solar farms, keeping vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach provided him with a steady and significant income, turning a potential six-figure loss from traditional farming into a substantial profit. The trend highlights a symbiotic relationship between renewable energy infrastructure and agriculture, offering a lifeline to small farmers.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has started moving northeast into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast, sparing the U.S. a direct landfall. Despite its trajectory, the hurricane generated tropical storm conditions in the Outer Banks and continues to create life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast. Storm surge warnings and evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina due to the danger of coastal flooding. Forecasters expect the storm to gradually weaken and become post-tropical by the weekend.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidelines for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to cease marketing snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence, following a BBC investigation that found some products were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with these voluntary measures, with the government suggesting further action could be taken if the industry fails to make sufficient changes.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retailer raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and expanding margins even while absorbing tariff impacts. Simon believes investors may have overreacted to a rare earnings miss caused by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He contends that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices makes its current market position stronger than ever. (not investment advice)</p>
