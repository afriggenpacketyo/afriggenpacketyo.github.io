        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant surge after the European Union agreed to a landmark $750 billion energy purchase from the United States. This deal is part of a broader trade agreement aimed at reducing the EU's energy dependence on Russia. Companies like Cheniere and Venture Global saw their stock prices climb, reflecting market optimism about increased demand. The agreement also includes a 15% U.S. tariff on EU exports and a commitment from Brussels to invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Haptic Technology Aims to Improve Aviation Safety by Preventing Pilot Disorientation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:51:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a condition contributing to 5-10% of general aviation accidents, which are 90% fatal. The system involves a flight suit or pilot seat that uses haptic vibrations, similar to a car's lane departure warning, to provide sensory cues to a disoriented pilot. This additional sensory input is designed to help pilots maintain control when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in bad weather. The goal is to conduct flight tests to validate the technology and ultimately enhance flight safety.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Short-Term CDs and High-Yield Savings Accounts for a $20,000 Deposit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:49:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with a significant sum like $20,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) against high-yield savings accounts. This article calculates potential earnings, showing that short-term CDs with fixed rates currently offer slightly higher returns than high-yield savings accounts with variable rates. For example, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn about $15 more than a savings account at 4.30%. The primary advantage of a CD is its guaranteed interest rate, providing predictability in an uncertain market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China to Offer Annual Subsidies to Families in Effort to Boost Declining Birth Rate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat a deepening demographic crisis, the Chinese government will offer families an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) per child under the age of three. This national policy follows various provincial-level incentives aimed at reversing three consecutive years of population decline and a record-low marriage rate. High childcare costs and career pressures have deterred many young couples from having children. While analysts view the subsidy as a positive step, they caution that the amount is likely too small to significantly impact the birth rate or stimulate domestic consumption on its own.</p>

His campaign launch video featured praise from the former president. The race is considered crucial for Republicans, who view Ossoff as a vulnerable incumbent in a key battleground state that Trump narrowly won in the previous election cycle.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their equity face a choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan, with experts offering differing advice for August 2025.

Others suggest HELOCs, as their variable rates could decrease if the Federal Reserve enacts further rate cuts. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's need for flexibility versus stability, their risk tolerance, and the specific purpose for which the funds will be used.

Despite this massive revenue, players currently receive just over 9% of the league's total revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share in men's leagues like the NBA and NFL.
