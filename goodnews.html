          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks have announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, causing their shares to surge. The new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both entities, creating a merged entity with approximately $9 billion in value and holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>

The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity with the Sounders, asserting that players are demanding a fair share of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts (about $9.5m) to participate in the tournament, but the league has allegedly refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1m for the entire team.</p>
