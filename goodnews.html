They project that Amazon Web Services can return to topline growth exceeding 20%, citing its strong backlog and partnerships in the AI sector as key catalysts for future performance.

          <p>Two men are facing felony charges for allegedly rigging poker games at two Southern California casinos, cheating them out of more than $30,000. Prosecutors claim Vaagn Galustyan and Armin Martirosyan marked high-value cards by bending their corners to gain an unfair advantage in subsequent hands. The alleged scheme was uncovered through security footage at the Pala Casino and Harrah's Casino. The district attorney noted that while card marking is an old cheating method, modern technology allows for its detection and prosecution, protecting local casinos from such scams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are protected from U.S. import tariffs due to a Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment. This exemption prevents presidents from regulating the flow of "informational materials," which has become particularly relevant amid the Trump administration's rollback of other tariff exemptions. The rule benefits the booming vinyl market, which has seen a major resurgence driven by younger buyers and artists like Taylor Swift. While consumers and record labels welcome the protection from price hikes, some American manufacturers argue that tariffs would support domestic production and job growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners considering a $15,000 home equity loan can expect slightly lower monthly payments compared to earlier in the year. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.36% would cost approximately $185 per month, while a 15-year term at 8.24% would be around $145 per month. While the reduction in cost is marginal, it reflects a more favorable borrowing environment for homeowners looking to tap into their equity. The article suggests comparing these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate HELOCs, which may offer even lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Need for Medicare Supplemental Coverage for Retirees</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For many retirees, Original Medicare (Parts A and B) is insufficient, as it covers only about 80% of medical costs and lacks an out-of-pocket maximum, potentially leading to substantial bills. Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, is designed to cover these costs, such as deductibles and coinsurance, providing financial predictability. While not every retiree needs a Medigap plan, it is often a critical tool for managing healthcare expenses, especially as medical needs typically increase with age. Unlike Medicare Advantage plans, Medigap policies offer the flexibility to see any provider nationwide who accepts Medicare, without network restrictions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Alternative Data Suggests Labor Market Slowed in September</h2>

          <p>Although the official jobs report was delayed by the government shutdown, alternative economic data suggests the U.S. labor market continued its trend of gradual slowing in September. High-frequency data from sources like the Chicago Federal Reserve, payroll processor ADP, and job-posting sites indicate that while job growth remains anemic, the market is not collapsing. These non-governmental sources point to a stable but softening environment, where employers are reluctant to lay off workers but are also hiring less. The consensus forecast had predicted growth of 51,000 nonfarm payrolls, with the unemployment rate holding at a historically low 4.3%.</p>

          <p>A whimsical 25-foot inflatable sculpture titled “Buggy Bear Crashes Made in L.A.” has been installed outside UCLA’s Hammer Museum. Created by artist Alake Shilling, the piece depicts a large, weary-looking bear driving a convertible and is a companion to the museum's seventh Made in L.A. biennial. Shilling's work often features cute, cartoon-like animals with melancholy expressions, reflecting a duality she sees as essential to a genuine expression of life. The installation captures the chaotic and often frustrating experience of driving in Los Angeles, resonating with commuters navigating the city's notoriously tangled traffic.</p>

          <p>Southern California is set to experience cooler-than-normal temperatures accompanied by gusty winds and potential light rain through Saturday. The National Weather Service has issued wind advisories for parts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties, with gusts potentially reaching up to 50 mph in some areas. Light showers have already been reported in Los Angeles, with most of the region expecting maximum temperatures in the 70s. The shift in weather provides a brief respite from warmer conditions but brings strong winds to coastal and inland areas, including the Mojave Desert.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: GOP Claims Linking Government Shutdown to Undocumented Immigrant Healthcare are False</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican leaders have falsely claimed that the government shutdown was caused by Democrats demanding healthcare benefits for undocumented immigrants. According to policy experts, this assertion is a distortion, as federal law already bars undocumented individuals from enrolling in major programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The budget dispute actually centers on Democratic efforts to reverse Medicaid cuts and extend ACA subsidies that benefit low-income Americans, which were affected by a recent Republican-backed tax law. Experts suggest the claim is a misleading political tactic that plays into anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

          <p>An AI-generated video showing former President Donald Trump announcing a new healthcare era featuring miraculous "MedBeds" is fake and part of a broader conspiracy myth. The video, which was briefly posted on Trump's Truth Social account, falsely claims every American will receive a card for access to beds that can cure any disease. Fact-checkers point to several signs of AI manipulation, including mismatched mouth movements and distorted images, confirming the video is not authentic. The MedBed myth originates from far-right online communities and preys on the desperation of people with chronic and incurable illnesses.</p>
