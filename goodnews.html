          <p>The United States has deployed its Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) air defense system in South Korea, marking the first known instance of such a system being stationed at an overseas U.S. base. This deployment, featuring a launcher and interceptors, is designed to counter cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, artillery, and mortars. The move is widely interpreted as a strategic response to rising military concerns regarding both China and North Korea in the region. This advanced mobile, ground-based weapon system enhances South Korea's defensive capabilities and signals a reinforced U.S. commitment to regional security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls and strip centers is creating unexpected real estate opportunities for small, local businesses. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth slowing, independent retailers, service providers, and health practitioners are securing prime commercial spaces once beyond their reach. Landlords, seeking to fill empty units and revitalize areas, are offering more flexible lease terms, including shorter lengths and rent-free periods. This trend allows small businesses to test physical presences without excessive capital commitment, fostering local regeneration and transforming vacant spaces into community-focused destinations, though challenges like high small business failure rates remain.</p>

          <p>Iconic performer Dolly Parton has postponed her upcoming Las Vegas concerts, originally scheduled for December, until September 2026 due to recent "health challenges." The 79-year-old singer announced on Instagram that her doctor advised her to undergo "a few procedures," though she did not specify details. Parton, who recently lost her husband, maintained a positive spirit, joking about needing a "100,000-mile check-up" that isn't a typical plastic surgery visit. While unable to rehearse for the Vegas shows, she assured fans she would continue working on other projects from Nashville, prioritizing her best performance for her audience.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut Monday, following its spin-off from parent company Sony Group. The new entity, valued at over $6.7 billion, includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank. Sony Group explained the separation allows its financial arm to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties, citing competing investment demands in entertainment and semiconductors. This strong debut occurred as broader Asia markets mostly rose, with South Korea's Kospi adding 1.25%, though Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after hitting a record high on Friday.

          <p>The article discusses "energy vampires," friends who deplete one's emotional energy through constant complaining, self-focus, or lack of interest in others. Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as an excessive need for attention and reassurance, or subtle mood-chipping through backhanded compliments. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that how one feels after interactions is a key indicator. The article offers three strategies: honest communication about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries like limiting contact or defining conversation topics, and changing shared activities to reduce their dominance. These methods aim to protect one's well-being while navigating challenging friendships.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to adopt green marine fuels hinges significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While Hong Kong has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling, green methanol requires a robust system for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced fuel tax-free. Wang's remarks coincided with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. With Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, CM Energy expects to increase its green methanol usage from 2027, despite the fuel costing four times more than traditional options.</p>
