        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, showcasing him with a red tie and deeper shadowing on his face, a contrast to the earlier portrait from January which featured a blue tie and a brighter illumination. The updated photograph, set against a black backdrop, has already been updated on the White House's website, though details regarding the reason for the update or whether it will replace existing official photographs in federal buildings remain unclear. The previous portrait from Trump's first term showed him smiling broadly in front of an American flag. This change reflects a shift in visual representation by the administration.</p>

Haliburton himself participated in the trolling, wearing all black to the game and carrying a duffel bag, alluding to a funeral for the Knicks.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to a concerned constituent by saying, "Well, we're all going to die," which Scholten criticized as lacking leadership. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly concerning Iowa soybean farmers. While Iowa's House seats are competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in several U.S. states, including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and others. The sun's current phase of maximum activity in its 11-year cycle is contributing to more frequent and widespread light displays. Experts recommend observing from dark areas away from city lights and checking weather forecasts for clear skies. Taking photos with a smartphone camera may reveal auroral hints not visible to the naked eye.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The divers, who believed the line was illegal, were ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and international travel. Their attorney argued that the case should never have been filed, as the men were trying to save sharks from what they thought was an illegal fishing setup. The pardons erase the convictions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has prioritized the project, pushing Japan and South Korea to invest, while Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured. The project aims to build an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet, where gas would be cooled and shipped to U.S. allies in Asia. Defense Department support has been pledged to support the project with its resources.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election to choose a successor to former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and removed from office over his bid to impose martial law. The National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon in December, suspending him from duty, and the Constitutional Court upheld the decision in April. This election marks a significant moment for the country as it seeks to stabilize its political landscape after months of turmoil.

          <p>Due to rising tariffs, a restaurant in Beijing has been forced to replace American ingredients with alternatives, including substituting Australian beef in its "Great American" burger. The owner of Kunyuan restaurant had to remove salt-baked chicken feet, imported from America, from the menu due to a 30% price increase. While the owner can source chicken feet from Brazil or Russia, he said they don't compare to the American ones and hopes to serve his American phoenix talons once again. The owner believes the price of American chicken feet will come back down, "as long as there are no big changes in the world's political situation."</p>

The agreement aims to foster greater collaboration between the agencies and improve their finances. The dispute primarily concerned the price the Water Authority pays MWD for an exchange of water, and this settlement brings greater fiscal certainty and new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most. This will also stabilize water rates for people in San Diego County.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The closures, initially part of a broader effort led by Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE team to cut costs, would have impacted farmers' access to essential resources. Lawmakers argued that the closures would disproportionately affect California, the nation's largest agricultural state. The reversal demonstrates a responsiveness to local concerns and the importance of maintaining frontline services for farmers and rural communities.</p>
