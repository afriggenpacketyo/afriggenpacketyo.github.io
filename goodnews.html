          <h2>India Aims to Become Rare Earth Elements Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 04:19:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth element (REE) reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates REE production and processing. With the world facing a rare earths shortage due to China's export curbs, India sees an opportunity to become an alternative supplier. While India possesses substantial REE reserves, it lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan. Overcoming these challenges through public and private investment, along with developing specialized technical expertise and improving infrastructure in mining regions, will be crucial for India to realize its potential in the global REE supply chain.</p>

          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, with approximately two billion cups consumed daily worldwide. From Ethiopian coffee ceremonies to Turkish coffee ground readings and Vietnamese egg coffee, the beverage has taken on diverse forms and traditions across different regions. Historically, coffee's journey involved trade winds, spiritual practices, and colonial ambitions, transforming it from a sacred brew to a global commodity. Cafes have served as incubators of ideas and revolutionary thought, evolving into modern-day refuges and social hubs, demonstrating coffee's enduring influence on societies throughout history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has unveiled a 100 billion yen policy package to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amid global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. This initiative is partly motivated by the departure of researchers from the United States due to funding cuts and prioritization of American students. The policy will fund existing programs, such as Tohoku University's recruitment plan, and aims to raise researcher salaries, reduce administrative burdens, and acquire advanced technology for institutions. Despite recent efforts, Japan's ranking in highly cited scientific papers remains low, prompting the government to consider additional measures to retain researchers.</p>

          <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor and chancellor emeritus at Heriot-Watt University, has died at the age of 85. Born in Jamaica, he moved to the UK as a teenager and became a renowned academic and human rights advocate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has encouraged the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, serve as a guarantee to the seller that the agreed amount will be paid by the buyer in time, enhancing payment security and credit. Unlike international L/Cs, which can only be used in transactions involving physical goods, domestic L/Cs can also be used in the trade in services. The payment period for domestic L/Cs is generally one year.</p>

          <p>Japan expects to receive special treatment in its tariff negotiations with the United States once a deal is finalized, according to Tokyo's top negotiator. This expectation comes after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a potential increase in import levies on cars, which would further hurt Japan's automotive industry. Ryosei Akazawa is visiting Washington for the fourth time in as many weeks to make progress in the talks, with the goal of securing concessions on auto tariffs. Japan is also seeking the removal of other sector-based and reciprocal tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the head researcher at the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins are not an alternative to gold, nor do they pose a threat to its role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade points out that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade wishes that proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0' because they clearly have different characteristics. Reade's comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar.</p>
