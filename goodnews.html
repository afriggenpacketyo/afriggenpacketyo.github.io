        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value has nearly doubled over the past year, a rally driven not by retail mania but by significant structural demand from institutional investors. The approval and massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, have been a primary catalyst, tightening supply and solidifying its status as a mainstream asset. This institutional adoption is further supported by anticipated regulatory clarity from Washington, with new legislation expected to define oversight responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC, potentially opening the door for wider financial integration.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in fixed income trading and investment banking. Despite a year-over-year drop in net income due to a prior gain on Visa shares, the bank's underlying performance was robust, leading to an increase in its full-year net interest income guidance. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the bank's results and the resilient U.S. economy but also reiterated his frequent warnings about persistent risks from trade policy, geopolitical conditions, and high fiscal deficits.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who had previously considered boycotting the 2021 All-Star Game if it remained in Atlanta due to Georgia's voting laws, is now managing in the rescheduled event in the same city. When questioned about his presence at the game while the controversial laws are still in place, Roberts deferred, stating he is not a politician and chooses to focus on celebrating the athletes. The 2021 game was moved to Denver following widespread criticism of the laws, but MLB has since returned the event to Atlanta for this year's Midsummer Classic.</p>

          <p>Beijing has lifted the sanctions it imposed in 2021 on Reinhard Buetikofer, a former German Member of the European Parliament known for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government. The move is viewed as a significant step toward normalizing diplomatic relations between China's National People's Congress and the European Parliament. An official meeting between the two legislative bodies is now tentatively planned for October in Brussels, which would be the first of its kind since 2018 and signals a potential thaw in political tensions between China and the EU.</p>

The president did not provide any specific details about the terms of the agreement but mentioned that it followed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. This announcement mirrors a similar one made about Vietnam, where subsequent reports indicated that Vietnamese officials had not formally accepted all the terms Trump had touted.

The crypto industry, led by companies like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the bills' passage to establish much-needed regulatory certainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international scientific collaboration has detected the gravitational waves from the largest black hole merger ever observed, an event that resulted in the formation of a new black hole 225 times the mass of the sun. The event, dubbed GW231123, involved two massive, rapidly spinning black holes, which themselves may have been the product of even earlier mergers. This groundbreaking discovery pushes the limits of scientists' current understanding of how such massive black holes are formed and behave, opening new avenues for research into the nature of spacetime and the universe.</p>
