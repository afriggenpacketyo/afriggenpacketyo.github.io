          <p>Mining giants Anglo American and Teck Resources have agreed to a significant "merger of equals," establishing Anglo Teck, which is projected to become one of the world's top five copper producers. This new Canadian-headquartered entity will be listed on exchanges in New York, Toronto, London, and Johannesburg, with Anglo American shareholders holding a majority stake. The announcement occurred amidst a confidence vote loss for France's prime minister, leading to a new government, and a watchful global market awaiting U.S. inflation reports and reacting to weaker hiring data. This strategic merger aims to create a global critical minerals champion, enhancing Canada's leadership and providing exceptional and enduring benefits.</p>

          <p>A protracted succession battle within Rupert Murdoch's influential conservative media empire has reached a resolution, positioning his son Lachlan Murdoch to control key outlets like Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. The family agreement ensures the continued conservative editorial direction of these properties, with Lachlan's older siblings selling their stakes for substantial financial compensation and relinquishing influence over the trust. This culmination of years of internal strife, which famously inspired a television drama, solidifies Lachlan's leadership following Rupert Murdoch's step back in 2023. The outcome is seen as a victory for Rupert's vision, albeit an expensive one, ensuring the desired political bent.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng plans to launch its affordable Mona series in international markets, including Europe, by 2026, intensifying competition in the global EV sector. CEO He Xiaopeng indicated the company's overseas expansion is accelerating faster than anticipated, having already met its 2025 goal of presence in 60 countries. Xpeng is also open to acquiring other EV makers to bolster its position, following the Mona M03's aggressive price point debut in China. This strategic move aims to challenge both Chinese rivals and established Western automakers, with the company exploring European manufacturing options amidst tariff concerns.

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially entered the contest to become Labour's deputy leader, emerging as the most senior figure to declare her candidacy for the role. She joins Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race to replace Angela Rayner, a position directly elected by Labour members. Candidates face a tight three-day window to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs, along with backing from 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, including two unions. The winner, who will be announced on October 25, will be chosen by a vote of party members, with some critics questioning the fairness of the rapid nomination timetable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has published its first-ever comprehensive league tables ranking NHS trusts, revealing specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital at the top, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn ranked lowest due to significant structural and performance issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized the tables' purpose to inform the public and enhance accountability, though NHS Providers raised concerns about the appropriateness of the chosen metrics. The rankings evaluate trusts across seven key areas, including waiting times for operations, cancer treatment, A&E performance, and financial health, sorting them into four categories. High-performing trusts will receive greater autonomy, whereas struggling ones will get enhanced support, with potential implications for leadership pay.</p>

          <p>Chinese search engine giant Baidu is issuing a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond, a yuan-denominated bond sold outside mainland China, to secure lower financing costs and enhance operational flexibility. This strategic financial maneuver is intended to fuel its aggressive artificial intelligence expansion, even as the company recently reported weak second-quarter earnings, including a 2% revenue drop and a 34% net profit fall. Baidu is part of a growing trend of issuers capitalizing on relatively low Chinese interest rates and increasing investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets. The bond, carrying a 1.9% annual coupon, is expected to close around September 15, 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French AI startup Mistral AI has achieved a remarkable valuation of 11.7 billion euros ($13.8 billion) in its Series C funding round, primarily driven by Dutch chip equipment maker ASML securing a significant 11% stake.

This substantial investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation, underscoring the continued massive influx of capital into the rapidly booming artificial intelligence industry.

          <p>Scotland secured a professional 2-0 victory against Belarus, effectively building momentum in their World Cup qualification campaign. This "joyless" but wholly professional win accomplished the mission of securing three crucial points.

The result, coupled with Denmark's strong 3-0 win against Greece, has significantly reshaped the group dynamics. Scotland is now well-positioned one-third of the way through the campaign, with a monumentally important home qualifier against Greece scheduled for next month.</p>
