          <h2>Polish Presidential Election Result Uncertain as Exit Polls Show Tight Race</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls from the Polish presidential election indicate a close contest between Warsaw's Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki. Initial polls showed Trzaskowski slightly ahead, but later polls gave Nawrocki the lead, with official results expected the following morning. The outcome of the election could significantly impact Poland's political landscape, particularly regarding the government's ability to implement key campaign promises and its relationship with the European Union. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but they differ on approaches to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties and Nawrocki advocating for a more sovereign Poland. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to reveal a significant defense review that includes plans to construct up to 12 new attack submarines, with an announcement expected from the prime minister. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance the armed forces' "warfighting readiness" in response to growing global threats. The new submarines, conventionally-armed and nuclear-powered, will replace the existing fleet starting in the late 2030s, and the UK will invest ¬£15 billion in its nuclear warhead program. The construction of these submarines is projected to support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with numerous apprenticeships and graduate roles. </p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at USC, US tariffs and technology restrictions are pushing China to innovate and find cost-effective solutions in its technology sector, particularly in artificial intelligence. Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but Chinese companies are responding by cutting costs and scaling up, as seen with the open-sourcing of AI models. These firms are also looking to other markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seeking to deepen trade with Europe by offering technology transfers. While challenges remain under the Trump administration, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing hard to remain competitive. </p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper's impressive performance at the French Open has garnered attention, with his next opponent, Alexander Bublik, acknowledging Draper's "insane" rise. Draper, who previously had no wins at the clay-court major, has made significant strides this season, reaching his first clay final in Madrid. Bublik himself has experienced a rankings roller coaster, falling before revitalizing his career with a change of approach. Draper's improved fitness and strong left-handed serve are key factors in his success, making him a contender for a Grand Slam quarter-final appearance. </p>

          <p>Ukraine's recent drone attack on Russian air force bases, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," is sending a critical message to both Russia and Ukraine's western allies. The operation, which reportedly took 18 months to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely, causing significant damage. While the exact extent of the damage is unverified, the attack serves as a propaganda coup and demonstrates Ukraine's continued resistance. The message aims to counter perceptions that Ukraine has already lost the war and to reinforce Kyiv's commitment to fighting for its independence. </p>
