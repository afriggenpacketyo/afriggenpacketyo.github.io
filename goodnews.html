          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that began over the weekend. The walkout had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced the deal, highlighting a key resolution that guarantees pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. While full service restoration may take over a week, the agreement averts further conflict after the union had defied a back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent surge in matcha's popularity represents a second wave, distinct from its mid-2010s trend, driven largely by social media aesthetics and its perception as a healthier caffeine alternative. This resurgence has transformed the ancient Japanese tea into a highly customizable and often heavily sweetened latte, making it more palatable to a Western audience. The article suggests this trend is less about the tea's authentic flavor and more about its visual appeal, the ritual of its preparation, and its role as a cultural touchstone in an algorithmically isolated society. The global matcha market is now projected to grow significantly, reflecting its mainstream adoption.</p>

          <p>During the annual MLB Little League Classic in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, a young Canadian player named Misha Lee offered a blunt assessment of New York Mets star Juan Soto. When asked if he would seek an autograph from Soto, Lee responded, "Eh, he’s kinda overrated. He’s all right," stating he would prefer to meet Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh. The amusingly honest take quickly went viral on social media. The game, which is played in conjunction with the Little League World Series, aims to connect major league players with young fans and celebrate the spirit of baseball.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group has agreed to acquire Tegna, another major local television station operator, in a deal valued at $6.2 billion, including debt. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the second half of 2026, will significantly expand Nexstar's reach. The combined entity will control 265 full-power television stations across 44 states, covering 80% of U.S. TV households. Nexstar's CEO cited the Trump administration's deregulation of the local TV sector as a key driver for the consolidation, which aims to help local broadcasters compete more effectively with large tech and media companies.

          <h2>Democratic Socialist India Walton Urges Progressives to Avoid Moderating Their Message</h2>

          <p>India Walton, a Democratic socialist who won the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary in Buffalo, New York, is advising progressive candidates not to move toward the political center. She argues that moderating her own message after the primary, such as softening her stance on charter schools, ultimately cost her the general election and alienated her base. Walton believes the Democratic Party's losses, including in the 2024 presidential election, stem from a failure to present a strong, populist economic message that resonates with working-class voters. She encourages progressives to remain firm in their principles to build authentic and powerful coalitions.</p>

          <p>Over the past three decades, the English Premier League (EPL) has transformed from a struggling domestic competition into the world's richest and most-watched soccer league. Its financial power, fueled by massive broadcast deals worth over $5 billion a season, allows its 20 clubs to attract top international talent, creating a highly competitive environment unmatched by other European leagues. While leagues in Spain and Germany are often dominated by one or two superclubs, the EPL's relative balance ensures competitive matches weekly. The challenge for the league now is to maintain its top position and avoid the stagnation that has affected its European rivals.</p>

The letter expresses gratitude for Mrs. Trump's advocacy regarding the thousands of Ukrainian children who Kyiv says have been abducted by Russia. This diplomatic exchange follows Melania Trump's own public letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to consider the welfare of children affected by the conflict. President Zelensky praised Mrs. Trump's compassion, stating her voice gives strength to the cause of returning the approximately 19,500 children Ukraine alleges were forcibly deported.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in top European soccer clubs, driven by soaring revenues and valuations. The combined revenue for Europe's five biggest leagues reached over 20 billion euros in the 2023-24 season, a 750% increase since the mid-1990s. This growth has made clubs like Manchester United, now valued at around £5 billion, highly attractive assets. Many American investors, including private equity firms, are adopting a multi-club ownership model to maximize returns, a practice that is drawing increased scrutiny from European soccer's governing body, UEFA.

          <p>Following a series of meetings at the White House, several European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, publicly expressed satisfaction with the diplomatic outcomes. They highlighted President Trump's apparent commitment to helping secure the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia as a key success. Despite the positive public statements, there is lingering uncertainty among observers about the substance and reliability of Trump's pledges to Ukraine. The leaders' relieved tone suggests they had anticipated a more difficult encounter, but the long-term implications of the talks are still unclear.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking its first miss on both metrics since 2014. Despite the shortfall, the home improvement retailer maintained its full-year forecast, projecting total sales growth of 2.8%. The company's CFO attributed the results to a continued "deferral mindset" among homeowners hesitant to take on large projects amid high interest rates. However, he also noted encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter, suggesting underlying momentum in core categories.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to wetland restoration as a nature-based solution to manage the dual climate challenges of intense rainfall and prolonged droughts. Urban sprawl and aging sewer systems have exacerbated flooding, while hotter summers deplete water reserves. By "depoldering"—returning reclaimed farmland to its natural marshy state—authorities are creating buffer zones that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during dry periods. These projects, part of the comprehensive Sigma Plan, have successfully turned initial public opposition into community support by also providing recreational and ecological benefits.</p>
