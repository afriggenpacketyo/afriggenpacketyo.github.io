          <p>Costco is partnering with Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at approximately half the typical market price. This offer is targeted at members paying out-of-pocket, as many insurance plans do not cover these drugs, addressing the soaring costs and limited supply that have driven some to seek unregulated compounded versions. The move could significantly increase access to these authentic medications amidst growing public demand and competition from alternative sellers.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to a technocratic body. While the U.S. views the response as positive, Hamas indicated that some details require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing to facilitate the safe release of hostages, and Israel has reportedly begun preparations to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. After being left off the wild card roster, the future Hall of Famer is expected to provide a steady presence from the bullpen. His inclusion, along with fellow left-hander Anthony Banda, is seen as a move to strengthen the pitching staff against the Phillies' lineup of left-handed batters in what could be his final postseason appearance before retirement.</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that "home bias" is exceptionally high among U.S. investors, who may be missing better value abroad. Kevin Carter of EMQQ Global highlighted the long-term potential of markets like China and India, pointing to India's favorable demographics and rapid growth as drivers for consumption, similar to China's trajectory over the past two decades.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García on human smuggling charges may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge cited "cause for concern" based on statements from Trump administration officials and the timing of the charges, which were filed shortly after Ábrego García successfully sued the administration over his wrongful deportation. The case highlights the partisan battle over President Trump's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

Despite Bill Gates calling it a "stupid" decision, Risher was won over by Jeff Bezos's obsessive focus on the customer experience and his bold vision for the company's growth. Bezos confidently predicted Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000, a compelling opportunity that Risher felt was too exciting to pass up.</p>
