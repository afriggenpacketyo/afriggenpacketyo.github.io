          <p>Caitlin Clark voiced her frustration with WNBA referees after a controversial no-call in the Indiana Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty. In the game's final seconds, Clark appeared to be fouled by Natasha Cloud, but no whistle was blown, costing the Fever a chance to tie or win the game. The no-call also prevented Clark from potentially reaching a milestone of a 20-point, 10-rebound game. Cloud has previously stated that criticism of physical plays against Clark is rooted in racism.</p>

          <p>French authorities suspect arson may have contributed to a significant power outage in southeast France, disrupting the Cannes Film Festival's closing day. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area and led to traffic disruptions and shop closures. Authorities are investigating a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes, and a collapsed high-voltage line. Despite the disruptions, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony, including the Palme d'Or award, would proceed as planned due to an independent power supply.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has increased his attendance at Senate hearings and votes after facing scrutiny over his mental health and absenteeism. Fetterman claims he feels unfairly shamed into fulfilling these duties, dismissing them as a "performative" waste of time. He attributes his increased presence to media outlets "weaponizing" his past absenteeism to portray him as mentally unfit. He expressed frustration that his openness about mental health struggles has been used against him.</p>

          <p>French authorities have confirmed that a power outage in Cannes during the film festival was caused by sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower. About 160,000 homes were left without power for hours, disrupting some screenings. Organizers stated the closing ceremony would proceed normally due to backup power. The outages recalled a similar incident last year, when arson attacks on rail lines caused travel chaos during the opening day of the Paris Summer Olympics.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his political film "It Was Just an Accident," despite facing decades of state censorship and imprisonment. Panahi, who was banned from filmmaking and international travel in 2010, found ways to continue his work clandestinely. His film confronts state violence and repression, drawing from his experiences in prison. Panahi insists he's simply doing the only thing he knows how, even if it means facing risks upon his return to Iran.</p>

          <p>Several cars from the 1970s have seen their values climb dramatically due to rarity, good looks, or desirability among collectors.

The 1970 Plymouth Hemi ‚ÄôCuda Convertible is particularly notable, with one selling at auction for nearly $2 million.

          <p>Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The incident occurred on May 1, with the loss of contact lasting about 20 seconds. The Army attributed the lost contact to a temporary antenna's location and stated that the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance‚ÄìBroadcast system. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through a media exclusive rather than directly to the agency.</p>
