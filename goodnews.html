          <h2>States Increasingly Override Local Zoning to Address Affordable Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, several states are enacting legislation to compel local municipalities to allow for more dense and affordable housing development. In Utah, where the median home price has soared to over $500,000, state laws now require cities to adopt strategies for cheaper housing, though enforcement remains a challenge. This top-down approach aims to combat restrictive local zoning rules, often referred to as NIMBY-ism, which limit construction to single-family homes and drive up prices. While developers and advocates see it as necessary, some local officials criticize the mandates as an overreach that diminishes community control and strains infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have restarted their joint oceanographic expeditions for the first time in five years, signaling a renewed commitment to bilateral scientific cooperation. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission aboard a Russian research vessel to study the effects of climate change in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The research will focus on deep-sea environments and sediment processes to better understand climate evolution over the last 126,000 years. This collaboration underscores the two nations' shared scientific interests and strategic ambitions, particularly concerning the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the European Union and China to strengthen their partnership to provide global stability. Meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, Xi described the two powers as "two big guys" who must enhance mutual trust and cooperation. He emphasized that the key lessons from their 50-year history are mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences. The call for a healthier relationship comes at a critical juncture, as both sides navigate complex geopolitical and economic challenges.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Attempt to End Birthright Citizenship Unconstitutional</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt another blow to former President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, ruling his executive order on the matter is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the proposed interpretation of denying citizenship to many individuals born in the United States violates the Constitution. This legal challenge is one of many filed against the order since it was signed. The principle of birthright citizenship is rooted in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 to grant citizenship to formerly enslaved people.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Walking 7,000 Steps Daily Offers Significant Health Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can significantly reduce the risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this more attainable target could be more effective at motivating people than the widely cited but less evidence-based 10,000-step goal. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, not scientific research. This analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that for most conditions, health benefits tended to level off after 7,000 steps, providing a practical new guideline for daily activity.</p>

          <p>Five Australian women who were subjected to invasive strip-searches at Doha's Hamad International Airport in 2020 have won a crucial legal victory, allowing them to proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways. An Australian federal court overturned a previous ruling that had dismissed the case, finding that the women have the right to sue both the airline and the airport operator. The incident, which sparked international outrage, occurred after a newborn baby was found abandoned in an airport bathroom, leading authorities to remove women from a flight for examination. The women are seeking damages for unlawful physical contact and false imprisonment, which they allege caused significant mental health trauma.</p>

          <p>Top European Union leaders met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to commemorate 50 years of diplomatic relations, with both sides acknowledging the pivotal and often tense state of their partnership. The summit, attended by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, aimed to foster dialogue despite significant disagreements over trade, market access, and industrial subsidies. While China's state media emphasized partnership, the EU has been vocal about creating a more level playing field for its firms. The talks occur as both powers navigate an aggressive U.S. trade strategy under President Trump.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography was surprised to discover a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, washed ashore in La Jolla, a species not typically found in the area. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, usually inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California, the first confirmed sighting by Scripps in a decade, coincides with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists suggest that continued warm water trends could lead to more frequent sightings of such species outside their normal habitats.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has reported record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to the continued high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. SK Hynix has solidified its leadership in the HBM market, outpacing competitors and expecting strong sales to continue through 2025. The company plans to increase capital expenditure to meet future demand and begin mass production of its next-generation HBM4 memory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this week, websites hosting pornographic content in the UK must implement robust age-verification systems to prevent access by minors, as mandated by the Online Safety Act. The media regulator Ofcom has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching. Non-compliant sites could face fines up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue. However, critics and users have raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs.

          <p>In a surprising reversal, San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This admission came after his debut at first base, a move that contrasted sharply with his previous insistence on only serving as a DH while with the Boston Red Sox. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change in stance follows a period of tension in Boston, where he had publicly rebutted the idea of playing a defensive role after being told to focus exclusively on hitting.</p>

          <p>South Korea has successfully avoided a technical recession, with its economy growing by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While the export surge provided a boost, analysts express caution about the sustainability of this growth, as domestic consumption remains modest and global trade faces uncertainty. The data comes as South Korea continues to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid significant tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
