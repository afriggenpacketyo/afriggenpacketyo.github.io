          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly kept its policy rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' predictions of a cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably moving toward its 2.5% target. This decision comes despite recent data showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting disappointment from the country's treasurer. The move caused a dip in the S&P/ASX 200 index and a strengthening of the Australian dollar amid a broader national economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully improved hearing in children and adults with a genetic form of deafness, according to a clinical trial. The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed considerable hearing improvement after six months, with younger participants responding best. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for future therapies for other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating the country must be able to defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision reverses a recent pause on some weapon shipments, which the White House had attributed to a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The Pentagon confirmed the move, framing it as part of an "America First" defense priority. The announcement follows recent calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, with Trump expressing his disappointment with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity as Study Destination for Chinese Students Amid Concerns About US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students pursuing higher education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Industry insiders suggest that cultural adjustment difficulties and safety concerns in the U.S. are prompting some Chinese nationals to consider alternatives. Singapore offers a welcoming environment with its cultural similarities, high economic openness, and renowned universities. While the U.S. has historically been the top choice, this shift could lead to a rise in applications to Singaporean institutions from Chinese students seeking to study abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is phasing out its long-standing policy requiring passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes. The change is being rolled out at several airports, including those in Baltimore and Philadelphia, with the goal of expanding it nationwide. This move reverses a rule implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident. Passengers who trigger screening alarms will still need to remove their footwear for additional checks, but the change is expected to enhance the passenger experience and speed up security processing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The approved amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent landlords from evicting tenants for renovations unless they have an official order from a government agency. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated during legitimate remodels, including provisions for landlords to cover relocation expenses and temporary housing. This follows a temporary ordinance put in place earlier this year to protect renters.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This marks a substantial loosening of previous regulations and has already led to an increase in foreign visitors. Travel companies are preparing for a larger influx of tourists, particularly from Europe and Asia, as the policy makes travel to China less cumbersome and costly. The move is seen as a way for the country to recover its tourism industry post-pandemic.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership was misleading. The lawsuit, filed by a former student, claimed a cybersecurity boot camp was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to refund tuition to hundreds of students and implement more transparent practices. The move is a significant development amid growing scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have cut tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA now states that staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition will be sufficient to meet its goals. The department is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year. The initial plan had drawn criticism, with some lawmakers arguing that significant cuts would inevitably impact veterans' care and benefits.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to the National League All-Star team as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB commissioner, an honor that caught him by surprise. Having made just nine starts this season after returning from surgery, Kershaw said he didn't feel he deserved the selection based on his 2025 performance but expressed gratitude for the recognition of his career. This will be his 11th All-Star selection, tying him for the most among active players. Kershaw is unsure if he will pitch in the game but plans to enjoy the experience.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. A South Korean lawmaker cited the vulnerability of legacy platforms like helicopters to modern air defenses and drones, as demonstrated in the war in Ukraine, as a key reason for the decision. The funds will be redirected toward investing in drones and other smart systems better suited for the future of warfare. This move reflects a growing global reevaluation of the role and survivability of attack helicopters on a modern, high-tech battlefield. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, as the reason for their decision. The march, which attracted a record crowd of over 200,000, was held in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has enacted anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.</p>
