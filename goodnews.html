          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of his concert tour dates through early July 2026 following a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The 76-year-old singer revealed that the condition has been exacerbated by recent performances, leading to issues with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor has advised him to undergo physical therapy and refrain from performing during his recovery. Fans who purchased tickets for upcoming shows will receive automatic refunds, as Joel looks forward to returning to the stage when his health improves. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a brain condition that is most common in people over 65 and involves a buildup of fluid inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, one of the 20th century‚Äôs most influential choreographers and the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, passed away at the age of 98. Grigorovich is best known for his 1968 production of ‚ÄúSpartacus,‚Äù an epic ballet that became a signature piece for the Bolshoi, emphasizing athletic spectacle and emotion. His choreography marked a departure from the Soviet-era ‚Äúdrambalet,‚Äù focusing instead on dance and athleticism. While celebrated in Russia, some Western critics found his work lacking in subtlety compared to choreographers like George Balanchine, but his impact on Russian ballet remains significant. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, granting a temporary restraining order after Harvard filed a lawsuit. Harvard argued that the administration's move was a violation of the First Amendment and due process, triggered by the university's alleged failure to comply with demands for information on student visa holders. The administration claimed Harvard fostered an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students and promoted pro-Hamas sympathies. Harvard President Alan Gerber refuted these claims, stating the university had responded to the Department of Homeland Security's requests as required by law.</p>

Djokovic, who is seeking his first title since last summer's Olympic gold in Paris, will face Hubert Hurkacz in the final.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography, which uses iodine-based dye, can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound. While MRI scans also show higher detection rates than standard mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely implemented. The study, involving over 9,000 women with dense breast tissue, found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams, compared to 4.2 with ultrasound. The technique is not yet approved for screening in the United States due to concerns over allergic reactions to the contrast agent, though most tumors detected were invasive and potentially life-threatening.</p>

The bill also introduces Medicaid work requirements, increases the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, and allocates significant funding for border security and defense.
