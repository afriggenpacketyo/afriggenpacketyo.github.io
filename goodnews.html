          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has held meetings with prominent former Federal Reserve officials, including Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard, as the search for the next Fed chair continues. Bessent is also advocating for significant reforms, proposing the central bank organically reduce its $6 trillion bond portfolio and minimize its overall economic footprint. This initiative comes amidst White House pressure for interest rate cuts and ahead of current Chair Jerome Powell's term expiration in May 2026. The administration seeks to reshape the Fed's direction, emphasizing a return to narrower objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of Social Security beneficiaries are projected to see a 2.7% to 2.8% increase in their monthly checks in 2026, according to new estimates based on recent government inflation data. This potential cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) would raise the average retirement benefit by approximately $54-55 per month, an increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025. However, retirees remain concerned about the impact of tariffs on inflation, fearing that benefit increases may not keep pace with rising essential expenses, particularly as Medicare costs are also expected to climb significantly next year.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. will share profits with Japan from American-based projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment, part of a recent tariff deal. Initially, profits will be split equally until Japan recoups its investment, after which the U.S. will receive 90% and Japan 10%. This agreement aims to boost domestic manufacturing in the U.S., funding projects like nuclear power plants and antibiotic production, while Japanese consumers benefit from lower tariffs. Lutnick emphasized that the deal should not ultimately cost Japanese taxpayers, assuming project returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, along with other foreign nationals, who were detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai battery factory in Georgia, have left Atlanta to return home. Following diplomatic discussions and an intervention by President Trump, detainees were given a choice to stay or leave, with most opting for repatriation. South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung criticized the U.S. visa system and expressed concern that such enforcement actions could deter future Korean investments. The raid, which involved about 475 people, has drawn attention due to its scale and impact on a major economic development project.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO Scott Strazik outlined a mixed outlook, projecting a 10-15% revenue decline for its wind business in 2026 due to soft orders and negative sentiment, particularly from the Trump administration. However, Strazik expressed optimism for growth opportunities in gas power and electrification, aiming for closer ties with hyperscalers building new data centers. Meanwhile, Boeing's stock saw a lift after Southwest Airlines increased its delivery expectations for the year, and the aerospace giant reached a tentative deal with striking workers at its defense business, signaling progress towards labor stability.

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell are set for a contest for the Labour Party's deputy leadership after the third candidate failed to secure enough nominations.

This race was triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation over a tax issue, and the winner will hold a powerful, un-sackable position linking the membership to leader Sir Keir Starmer, potentially influencing future election campaigns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index data reveals inflation climbed to 2.9% in August, posing a significant challenge for seniors on fixed incomes. As purchasing power erodes, many retirees are re-evaluating their strategies, with annuities emerging as a potential solution for guaranteed income. While traditional fixed annuities can be vulnerable to inflation, variable and indexed annuities offer market-linked returns or downside protection. Inflation protection riders, which automatically increase payments annually, are also available, though they may reduce initial payouts. Seniors must carefully assess these options to preserve their purchasing power throughout retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

With SpaceX's valuation nearing $400 billion and xAI potentially reaching $200 billion, Musk's stakes in these private entities now collectively surpass the value of his current 13% ownership in Tesla.

With FICO soon incorporating BNPL data into credit scores, these missed payments could negatively impact credit. To mitigate this, consumers are advised to consolidate debt with a low-rate personal loan, transfer balances to 0% APR credit cards, or seek help from a credit counselor. The article highlights the illusion of affordability and the accumulation of late fees as key dangers, urging a strategic approach to debt repayment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's perspective on retirement income suggests that a million-dollar portfolio could provide substantial financial security if invested wisely to generate consistent returns. While a 3% annual dividend might be challenging to achieve directly, this article explores alternative strategies such as high-dividend ETFs like iShares Core High Dividend ETF, offering over 3.4% yield, or 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds yielding over 4.9%. For even higher returns, corporate bond ETFs like iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF are discussed, with yields exceeding 6.5%.

          <p>Mortgage rates have experienced their largest weekly drop in a year, with the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 6.35%—the lowest since last October. This significant decline has spurred a surge in borrower demand, with applications for both home purchases and refinances reaching their highest year-over-year growth rate in over four years. The drop in rates is attributed to weakening labor market data, which has influenced Treasury yields.
