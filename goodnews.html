          <p>The announcement that Republican Senator Thom Tillis will not seek reelection has ignited the 2026 North Carolina Senate race, making it a key open-seat battleground. Potential Republican candidates include Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law, who has confirmed she would consider running and has received his endorsement. For Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a bid and is seen as a top contender to flip the seat.

          <p>The FBI has announced its intention to move its headquarters from the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building to the nearby Ronald Reagan Building complex in Washington, D.C. This decision marks a reversal of a previous plan from the Biden administration to relocate the headquarters to a new facility in Greenbelt, Maryland. Officials stated that moving to an existing property would be faster and more cost-effective for taxpayers than constructing a new building. The current FBI headquarters, in use since 1975, has fallen into significant disrepair, prompting years of discussion about its relocation.</p>

          <p>Two-time Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat has taken on the challenge of scoring the new film "Jurassic World: Rebirth," following in the footsteps of his idol, John Williams. Desplat, known for his elegant and idiosyncratic scores for directors like Wes Anderson and Guillermo del Toro, aimed to honor Williams' iconic themes while creating new motifs for the film. He explains that director Gareth Edwards encouraged him to write memorable, catchy themes in the Williams tradition. Desplat's work on the film reflects his career-long admiration for Williams, whose music for "Star Wars" inspired him to become a film composer.</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is rolling out a mandatory facial recognition feature, "Face Check," for all of its users in California. The function requires users to take a short video selfie, which is then used to verify that their face matches their profile photos and to detect duplicate or impersonator accounts. This move is part of a broader effort by parent company Match Group to enhance user trust and combat the rising prevalence of romance scams and fraudulent accounts. The initiative comes as Congress also takes action with the Romance Scam Prevention Act.</p>

The article places this deal in the context of other major sports, noting that while MLB contracts for players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have higher total values, top NBA players earn more per year due to smaller roster sizes. The deal highlights the immense earning power of elite basketball players, with 18 currently under contract to make over $50 million per season.</p>

While stating it is "business as usual for now," a Santander spokeswoman did not rule out future branch closures or job cuts due to role duplication.
