        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and U.K. have reached a trade deal that includes tariffs, suggesting that President Trump's reciprocal tariff policy is here to stay. The agreement allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free. This deal indicates that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners, though sector-specific deals with carve-outs are possible. Analysts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with the U.S. maintaining flexibility on sectoral tariffs but generally adhering to a minimum 10% tariff.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed a tepid endorsement of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans while acknowledging the political challenges of such a move. Trump indicated he would "graciously" accept a small tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also cautioned Republicans against it, citing potential backlash. This stance signals a willingness to deviate from traditional Republican tax policies, though he remains wary of potential political repercussions. Trump's consideration of this tax hike comes as part of a larger tax and spending bill aimed at navigating a divided Congress.</p>

The State Department has stated it is prioritizing resettlement for Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the half-ton spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, posing a small risk to humans. The spacecraft, originally intended for a Venus mission, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. While most of the spacecraft disintegrated years ago, the landing capsule is believed to have remained in orbit, and its reentry could pose a hazard if the heat shield remains intact.</p>

Most English and Australian players are expected to leave India, potentially impacting the tournament's resumption. If a short-term restart is not possible, there is a strong desire to complete the tournament later in the year due to its financial value. The Asia Cup, initially scheduled for September, may be scrapped to accommodate the IPL, and long-term questions persist over future matches between India and Pakistan.</p>
