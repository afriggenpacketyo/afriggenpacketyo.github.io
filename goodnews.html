          <p>Professional golfer Collin Morikawa is redirecting his attention towards representing the United States in the Ryder Cup, an event he considers the "biggest honor." This shift in focus comes after a disappointing performance overseas, where he missed the cut at both the Scottish Open and the Open Championship. Despite his recent struggles, Morikawa remains hopeful about his game, acknowledging that small adjustments can lead to significant turnarounds and emphasizing the profound pride he feels when playing for his country.</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a major free trade agreement, hailed as the UK's most significant post-Brexit trade deal. The agreement will lower tariffs on exports such as British cars and whisky to India, and Indian textiles and jewelry to the UK, aiming to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. The deal also includes new commitments to collaborate on tackling illegal migration, with both leaders celebrating it as a blueprint for shared prosperity and a strengthening of historical ties.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of technological advancement, a fleet of 16 drones successfully transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete up a mountain in China's Yunnan province. The materials were used to construct three electricity transmission towers at high altitudes, a task that the autonomous drones completed in just three days. This method proved to be ten times more efficient than the traditional approach of building cableways, which typically takes a month. The operation highlights the growing capabilities and labor-saving potential of unmanned aerial systems in large-scale construction projects.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has successfully dismantled a large-scale extortion network with ties to a major drug cartel, marking the country's biggest crackdown on such a group to date.

          <p>Australia has announced it will reduce restrictions on beef imported from the United States, a move the Trump administration is calling a significant trade breakthrough. The restrictions were originally put in place to protect Australia from mad cow disease, but Australian authorities are now satisfied with new U.S. tracing and control measures. While the U.S. celebrated the greater market access for its farmers, some Australian opposition figures expressed concern about the speed of the decision. However, analysts believe Australian demand for U.S. beef will remain low due to pricing, making a large market impact unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A multi-agency operation led by the U.S. Secret Service was conducted in Tennessee and Mississippi to combat the rising problem of EBT card skimming. The initiative focused on inspecting thousands of point-of-sale terminals, ATMs, and gas pumps to find and remove illegal skimming devices used to steal government benefits from vulnerable families. Agents recovered four devices, preventing an estimated $4.2 million in potential fraud, and educated business employees on detection methods. This crime is particularly harmful as it targets funds meant for essential needs like food, directly impacting families in need.</p>

These large, standardized complexes are seen as symbols of upward mobility and offer convenient, self-contained lifestyles with integrated amenities. While this model has led to a uniform cityscape and its own affordability crisis, it has also efficiently housed a dense population.</p>

          <p>This article examines why death remains a significant taboo in American culture, despite it being a universal experience. Many people think about death but are unwilling to discuss it, leading to a lack of preparation for end-of-life care and estate planning. The modern avoidance of death is traced back to the 19th century with the rise of the for-profit funeral industry and the medicalization of dying, which isolated people from the process. The piece argues that overcoming this silence is life-affirming, allowing for better care, reduced family conflict, and a more meaningful approach to life and grief.</p>
