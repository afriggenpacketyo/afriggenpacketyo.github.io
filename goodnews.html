          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 22:00:13 EDT</div>

          <p>Facing a shrinking population, China's manufacturing sector is increasingly turning to automation, with a record 295,000 industrial robots installed in factories last year. These robots are performing tasks like welding, assembling electronics, and moving heavy loads, addressing labor shortages caused by demographic shifts. Experts believe this trend is inevitable for simple, repetitive tasks, while complex and creative work still requires human ingenuity. Despite the population decline, China's manufacturing industry is expected to maintain its competitive edge through workforce education and robot adoption. This adaptation underscores China's strategy to sustain economic growth despite demographic challenges. The article highlights China's focus on automation to overcome labor shortages. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the complexities surrounding compensation for individuals claiming injuries from COVID-19 vaccines, explaining that these vaccines are not currently covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). Instead, they fall under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which is more restrictive and has a shorter statute of limitations. Legal experts argue for the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccines in the VICP to provide fairer compensation to those injured, citing the public's expectation of support after widespread vaccination efforts. The article also addresses concerns about potential backlogs and the need for increased infrastructure to handle a surge in claims if COVID-19 vaccines are added to the VICP. The information underscores the challenges and potential solutions for compensating those who experience adverse effects from emergency medical measures. </p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index soared to a record high after the Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi, known for her pro-stimulus policies, as its new leader. Real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks led the gains, with Yaskawa Electric Corp and Japan Steel Works experiencing significant jumps. Analysts anticipate that Takaichi will encourage the Bank of Japan to maintain its accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, while bond yields rose, reflecting market expectations of continued economic support.

          <p>Approximately 30 million UK residents who purchased an Apple or Samsung smartphone between 2015 and 2024 could receive around £17 each if consumer group Which? wins its case against Qualcomm. Which? is pursuing legal action against the chip company, accusing it of anti-competitive practices that forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential handset components. The trial will determine whether Qualcomm abused a dominant market position, potentially leading to a £480 million payout to affected consumers. This legal action is similar to ongoing cases in Canada and previous antitrust fines imposed by the EU. </p>
