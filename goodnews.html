          <p>Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist, has died at 91 from natural causes while on a speaking tour. Her groundbreaking research in Tanzania revolutionized science by demonstrating chimpanzees' tool-making abilities and complex social behaviors, challenging previous understandings of human-animal distinctions. Goodall founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, tirelessly advocating for wildlife protection, environmental restoration, and empowering youth through programs like Roots & Shoots. She was also a UN Messenger of Peace, emphasizing humanity's interconnectedness with the natural world and the urgent need for environmental action.</p>

          <p>FIFA is likely to schedule 2026 World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time to mitigate heat issues experienced during the recent Club World Cup. The tournament, hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will have 48 teams and 11 days with four games, making 12:00 local time kick-offs common. Concacaf president Victor Montagliani acknowledged kick-off times are a significant concern, especially given summer heat in North America. While some stadiums have roofs, it's impractical for all early games, leading to ongoing discussions with media to balance player welfare with broadcasting needs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to support its currency and stabilize its economy, a move that contradicts 'America First' rhetoric but aims to bolster free-market and democratic institutions in Latin America. This assistance supports President Javier Milei's radical reforms, which have significantly reduced inflation and revived the housing market. Milei's gamble with peso devaluation, however, led to an overvalued currency and threatened central bank reserves. The proposed bailout would provide time for further devaluation and elimination of capital controls, with the funds coming from a Federal Reserve credit line previously used for allies.

          <p>Intel's stock saw a 7% surge following reports that the company is in early discussions with AMD to manufacture chips for its foundry business. This potential partnership would mark a significant victory for Intel Foundry, which is actively seeking major customers to boost investment in its manufacturing technology and signal its capabilities to the industry. Such a collaboration would also indicate AMD's confidence in utilizing its primary competitor for chip production, despite currently relying on TSMC. The specific scope of potential manufacturing remains undisclosed, but the news follows recent votes of confidence in Intel from investors like Nvidia and the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Caribbean coast, specifically the Mompos Depression and Montes de María, is recognized as the birthplace of cumbia, a music genre born from African, Indigenous, and European cultural fusion during colonial times. Enslaved Africans brought drums and spirituality, Indigenous cultures contributed flutes, and European influences shaped dance and language. The article highlights key figures like Emilia Reyes Salgado and Petrona Martinez, emphasizing the role of Black and Afro-descendant women in preserving this legacy. San Jacinto is noted as the epicenter of gaita music, where pre-Hispanic flutes became a symbol of peace amidst civil war, breathing life into cumbia.</p>

          <p>NPR has launched "Cumbia Across Latin America," a bilingual visual series documenting the pervasive influence and evolution of cumbia music across six countries. Once considered the soundtrack of the working class, cumbia's infectious rhythm has transformed, absorbing local styles and becoming a symbol of Latin American identity. The series, supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, features photographers Karla Gachet and Ivan Kashinsky, who spent years capturing the people, places, and cultures sustaining this vibrant genre. It traces cumbia's journey from its Colombian coastal origins through its spread across the continent and beyond, accompanying migrants and adapting to new contexts.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity firm, is poised for further growth, according to Wells Fargo, which added the stock to its "tactical ideas list" and raised its price target to $600. Analysts anticipate an acceleration in the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth, signaling recovery from a global IT outage in July 2024. CEO George Kurtz's strategy of offering customer commitment packages to retain clients is now expected to convert into full-paying subscriptions, boosting ARR. The Falcon Flex licensing model and increasing demand for securing AI agents against sophisticated AI-based attacks are also identified as significant long-term growth drivers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, federal student loan payments remain due, as the Department of Education will furlough approximately 87% of its staff. The department's contingency plan ensures that federally mandated programs like FAFSA processing and aid disbursements continue. Borrowers primarily interact with loan servicers, which are expected to remain operational, minimizing direct impact on payments or account management. However, customer service at the Department of Education, already slowed by prior layoffs, may be further challenged. Students needing assistance with FAFSA or aid are advised to contact their school counselors or financial aid offices.</p>

Essential services like applying for benefits, appealing decisions, and replacing Social Security cards will still be available. However, non-essential services such as proof of income letters, earnings record updates, and Medicare card replacements will be unavailable. A potential delay in the release of new CPI data could also impact the announcement of the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment.</p>
