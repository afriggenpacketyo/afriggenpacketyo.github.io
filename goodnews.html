          <p>A new report from Microsoft suggests that blue-collar jobs requiring physical labor are among the least likely to be impacted by generative artificial intelligence. Researchers analyzed user interactions with the Bing Copilot AI and found that tasks involving information gathering and writing were most frequently and successfully performed by AI, placing roles like translators and writers at higher risk. In contrast, professions such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers were deemed safer from AI replacement. The report highlights a growing trend where manual and skilled-trade jobs offer more stability in the face of AI advancements.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the pivotal yet unsung role of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson in the 2025 Tour de France. As a domestique for team Visma Lease-a-Bike, Jorgenson's primary job was to support team leader Jonas Vingegaard against the dominant Tadej Pogačar. Despite battling bronchitis and facing personal setbacks, Jorgenson repeatedly launched attacks to wear down Pogačar, even when a victory for his team seemed hopeless. His persistent efforts ultimately created an opening for his teammate Wout van Aert to win the final stage, demonstrating the profound impact of selfless teamwork in professional cycling.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Pakistan have reached a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's oil reserves and provides lower tariffs on its exports to the U.S. The announcement was made by U.S. President Donald Trump, who stated that an American oil company would be chosen to lead the development efforts. Pakistan's finance minister confirmed the deal, calling it a "win-win" situation that goes beyond immediate trade imperatives to foster long-term investment. This development occurred shortly after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's high tariffs and trade with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new airline Air Borneo, are showing interest in purchasing China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet. According to Malaysia's Transport Minister Anthony Loke, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from Airbus and Boeing, is driving regional carriers to seek alternatives. The C919, manufactured by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is being promoted as a more readily available and cheaper option. This interest reflects a broader trend of airlines looking to diversify their aircraft procurement sources.</p>

Mumbai-based conglomerate Godrej Industries Group acquired the jewels and facilitated their return, and they will now be put on permanent public display in India.

          <p>Despite facing a 25% U.S. tariff, India has strategically avoided rushing into a trade deal, primarily to protect its domestic agricultural sector from American competition. Indian officials have maintained that the interests of their farmers, a crucial voting bloc, are a "red line" and that they will not negotiate based on deadlines. Analysts suggest that because exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy, India has the leverage to resist concessions. Furthermore, India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade deals with other partners like the U.K. and the E.U. to diversify its economic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>
