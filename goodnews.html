          <h2>Aramco Reports Slight Dip in First-Quarter Profit Due to Lower Crude Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 03:11:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit experienced a 5% year-on-year decrease, settling at $26 billion, slightly surpassing analyst projections of $25.3 billion, but down from $27.3 billion in the same period last year. This decline is attributed to weaker crude prices and reduced production, placing a strain on the company's balance sheet amid sluggish global demand. Aramco's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, with a cut in its performance-linked dividend payout for Q4 2024 to $200 million. However, the base dividend saw a 4.2% increase to $21.1 billion year-on-year, signaling mixed financial signals for the oil giant.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has lauded the first day of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland as a "total reset" in relations, describing the discussions as "very good" and constructive. The meeting, involving China's vice-premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, aims to de-escalate the escalating trade war that has seen both countries impose tariffs on each other's goods. While details remain scarce, Trump expressed optimism about opening China to American business, though the White House has indicated that tariff reductions depend on Chinese concessions.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that China is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects in Africa, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investments in Africa amounted to US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, experiencing a surge in exports. This shift aligns with global trends, as China committed to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021, driven by Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to embrace their flaws and reject the unrealistic ideal of being a perfect mother. Ross argues that being flawed is an essential part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections and understand that relationships involve give and take. She also addresses the historical tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems, urging a shift towards recognizing and appreciating the contributions of mothers.</p>
