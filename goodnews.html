          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The airport was closed to all flights for much of March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation in Hayes, west London. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious. The outage disrupted more than 270,000 journeys.</p>

          <p>Footage of a Powelliphanta augusta snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, according to New Zealand's conservation agency. The snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand, was filmed at a facility where conservation rangers are attempting to save the species from extinction. The species, like other snails, are hermaphrodites. The snails take eight years to reach sexual maturity and lay about five eggs a year, with each egg taking over a year to hatch.</p>

Maersk kept its 2025 profit guidance unchanged at between $6 billion and $9 billion.
