          <p>E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% decline in net income for its first fiscal quarter since President Donald Trump's tariffs were announced, causing an initial stock drop. Despite this, CEO Tarang Amin emphasizes the company's consistent growth over 26 quarters and strategic expansions, including the new $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. This article notes that E.l.f. is already the No. 1 color cosmetics brand in the U.S. by units sold and the most purchased by Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial consumers. Experts are cautiously optimistic about the Rhode deal, expecting it to be accretive despite being financed with $600 million of debt, positioning E.l.f. for continued market leadership and challenging legacy players.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve shifts towards potential rate cuts, savers are evaluating money market accounts (MMAs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Both offer higher variable interest rates than standard savings, but MMAs typically include debit card and check access, often with higher minimum balances or tiered APYs. HYSAs generally have lower entry barriers and are ideal for emergency funds or short-term goals, while MMAs suit larger nest eggs needing occasional access. The choice depends on individual needs, accessibility, and fee considerations, though both are FDIC-insured and provide a secure way to save. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As year-end approaches, retirees aged 73 and older face required minimum distributions (RMDs) from pretax retirement accounts. For those with ample income, options exist to manage these withdrawals effectively. Strategies include reinvesting RMDs into brokerage accounts, preferably with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for tax efficiency and easier tax-loss harvesting. Charitable investors can utilize qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) to satisfy RMDs tax-free, benefiting non-profits. Additionally, RMDs can fund 529 college savings plans for family, potentially offering state tax credits and supporting legacy planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly stepping up its attempts to sign Crystal Palace and England centre-back Marc Guehi, with initial talks already held for the 25-year-old. Guehi has one year left on his contract, and Palace chairman Steve Parish indicated he could be sold this summer to avoid a free transfer in 12 months' time. While Palace is believed to want £40m, Liverpool aims for a lower fee for the defender. This article notes that this potential acquisition comes as Liverpool has already spent about £270m this summer, though they have recouped approximately £170m through player sales, indicating active squad restructuring.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% annually in July, slightly below economists' forecasts of 2.8%, while the monthly increase was 0.2%. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, increased 3.1% over the past year, marking its highest level in five months. While food prices rose 2.7% annually, gasoline prices dropped 9.5%. Experts note some tariff pass-through to consumer prices, but it's not yet alarming, though economists debate whether tariff-induced price increases will be temporary or lasting. This data keeps a Federal Reserve rate cut in September likely, despite the uptick in core inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Princeton Review has released its list of top 10 colleges for financial aid, highlighting institutions that offer generous awards despite rising sticker prices. Many colleges are nearing or exceeding $100,000 in total cost, but few families pay the full amount, with average out-of-pocket costs closer to $31,000. The rankings consider both award generosity and student satisfaction with aid packages. Schools like Washington and Lee University and Princeton University demonstrate high average need-based scholarships, significantly reducing the actual cost for students and emphasizing the importance of comprehensive financial planning beyond just savings and loans.</p>
