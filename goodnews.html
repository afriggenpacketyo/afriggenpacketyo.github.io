          <p>During the G7 summit, President Donald Trump showcased a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump accidentally dropped the document and initially misidentified the agreement as being with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK, and Trump acknowledged that it was "not much" different from a previous agreement signed in May. The new agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick set to determine quotas for products entering the U.S. without tariffs, which demonstrates ongoing trade negotiations and agreements between the U.S. and the UK. This agreement is expected to produce jobs and income for both nations.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and Sendai in northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stalled between stations. JR East, the operator, halted services on the Tohoku shinkansen line, anticipating resumption around 7 p.m. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing two other trains to halt as well. This disruption highlights the importance of safety inspections and maintenance for high-speed rail transport. While inconvenient for travelers, the suspension is a precautionary measure to ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Chris Woakes' return to the England squad for the Test series against India is seen as vital, particularly given his past performances and the team's reliance on him. At 36, Woakes is the oldest player in the squad and is expected to lead the bowling attack due to his accuracy and movement, which could trouble the Indian batting lineup. Woakes emphasizes the importance of being a "senior" bowler and supporting younger players. His role is critical for England's chances in the series, especially with his experience and consistency.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April of next year, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5%.

The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen.
