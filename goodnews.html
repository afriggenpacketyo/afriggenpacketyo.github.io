          <p>This article explores the potential returns of investing $10,000 in a three-year certificate of deposit (CD) in the current economic climate. With top rates for this term hovering around 4.15%, savers could earn nearly $1,300 in guaranteed interest over the 36-month period. The piece contrasts this with the variable rates of money market accounts, suggesting that locking in a fixed CD rate now could be advantageous as the Federal Reserve considers future rate cuts. It emphasizes that while long-term CDs offer predictable growth, savers must be certain they won't need the funds early to avoid penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece advises savers to choose online banks for better returns due to their lower overhead costs and to compare different high-yield accounts to maximize earnings.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer has announced its decision to sell 200 shares of Disney (DIS), reducing its overall position in the company. The move follows a strong rebound in the stock's value, which has risen approximately 9% in 2025, outperforming the S&P 500. Cramer noted that while he believes the company's turnaround under CEO Bob Iger is ongoing, the principle of 'discipline trumps conviction' necessitates taking some profits off the table after a successful period. The sale will realize a loss on shares bought at a higher price but contributes to an overall gain on the total position. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a 'genetic switch' that could potentially enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited to animals like salamanders. Their research, published in the journal Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a specific gene responsible for this acid's production, the scientists were able to trigger ear tissue regeneration in a mouse. The researchers believe this discovery could play a significant role in advancing regenerative medicine for various tissue types in vertebrates.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is in talks with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 Formula 1 season. While Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, his deal is rumored to contain exit clauses. The speculation is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and upcoming major regulation changes in 2026, which could make Mercedes a more competitive option. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are being influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the four-time champion, adding a significant layer of intrigue to the driver market.</p>

Adams, who is now running as an independent, contrasted his experience with that of his chief rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani, whom he labeled an inexperienced socialist with "empty promises." The announcement comes after a challenging first term for Adams, marked by a federal investigation and criticism over his policies.

          <p>This opinion article posits that Zohran Mamdani's apparent victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary represents a significant blow to the party's establishment and its perceived passivity. The author argues that the 33-year-old socialist's success, built on a disciplined message about affordability and a grassroots movement, proves the party's left flank can be a major asset, not a liability. Mamdani's win is framed as a rebuke to risk-averse Democratic leaders who have failed to match their voters' energy. It suggests a new, more progressive vision for the party may be emerging from the ground up.</p>

While some participants, including a Wedbush analyst, praised the vehicles' smooth and impressive maneuverability, other incidents were reported, such as a car driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping in traffic. The event highlights Tesla's unique camera-based approach to autonomous driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar.

          <p>The once-ubiquitous hotel minibar, a symbol of travel convenience in the late 20th century, has largely disappeared from midscale hotels. The concept, which began at a Hong Kong Hilton in 1974, proved to be a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, food spoilage, and theft. By the early 2000s, major chains began phasing them out. In their place, hotels have shifted to more modern and efficient alternatives, such as 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Grubhub to provide guests with food and beverage options.</p>
