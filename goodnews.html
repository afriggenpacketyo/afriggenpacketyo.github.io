          <p>An opinion piece discusses the potential consequences of the United States' crackdowns on academia, suggesting it could lead to a brain drain. The author argues that restricting international students would diminish the talent pool for US graduate schools, especially in STEM fields, where international students constitute a significant portion of PhD recipients. With decreasing applications from China and Europe, and more American students exploring academic options abroad, the US risks compromising its human capital. The piece concludes that if the goal is to slow China's technological progress, these restrictions may be ineffective, as many Chinese students who studied abroad have returned to contribute to their home country's academic and technological advancements. The United States' loss may be other countries' gain.</p>

          <p>Amid rising concerns over sabotage and espionage, German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has called for increased use of artificial intelligence in national security. He stated that hybrid threats involving sabotage and espionage are constantly increasing, and the government feels the impact of the growing number of attacks on infrastructure, including civilian facilities such as energy grids and rail networks, as well as military sites such as barracks. Dobrindt said the government would allocate "substantial financial resources" to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies. This comes as German police have deemed membership in the AfD incompatible with service.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at lower prices, distributing it to smaller supermarket chains, specialty shops, and major retailers. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, raising concerns about emergency preparedness. The government suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice, contributing to the price surge, and the aim is to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices.</p>

Consumer spending on Temu and Shein has declined in the U.S., while it has grown in the EU and U.K., reflecting their strategic shift. Experts say that the European market enforces stricter regulations on product safety, consumer protection, and fair competition, requiring Temu and Shein to invest more in compliance.</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. The government aims to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women to participate in decision-making across various fields, focusing on local economies and small businesses. The policy cites a lack of entrepreneurial role models and advisory resources outside major cities, with plans to build a support network for entrepreneurs and address the gender pay gap.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have risen sharply, outpacing the global increase in Chinese exports. Pressured by import tariffs imposed by the U.S., Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for final production and re-export, including to the U.S. Analysts note that this diversification helps offset losses from high US tariffs and strengthens economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seeks court approval to buy the struggling firm for $256 million. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person's express, informed consent, and customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information.</p>

          <h2>Kelsey Plum Expresses Frustration Over Officiating in Sparks' Loss</h2>

          <p>Kelsey Plum voiced her frustration over the lack of foul calls during the Sparks' 89-81 overtime loss to the Golden State Valkyries, feeling she was getting fouled on nearly every possession. Despite leading the Sparks with 24 points, Plum shot only six free throws and felt that she was not getting the calls that other stars in the league receive. Coach Lynne Roberts echoed Plum's frustrations, pointing out the physicality directed towards Plum and stating that it is not right. The Sparks' loss was compounded by their struggles on the boards, as the Valkyries controlled the offensive glass and secured more second-chance opportunities.</p>
