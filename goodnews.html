          <h2>Nvidia Plans to Restart Advanced AI Chip Sales to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:09:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, following assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary export licenses will be granted. This development reverses a previous halt caused by U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced American technology. The policy shift comes after significant lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership. Analysts view this as a major positive for the company, anticipating it will serve as a significant new growth catalyst in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>China's Tianlong-3 rocket has successfully passed a critical ground-based stress test, a significant milestone for the private company Space Pioneer. The test simulated key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, using the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This success is particularly notable as it comes a year after a previous static-fire test ended in an explosive mishap where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed. The company stated that the test confirms the structural integrity of the rocket's tail section, which must endure enormous stress during launch and landing, paving the way for future missions.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing massive AI data centers in the United States to advance the development of "superintelligence." The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg noted one of the sites could eventually cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan. While the announcement boosted Meta's stock, the article also highlights the significant environmental impact of such facilities, which are extremely intensive in their use of energy and water.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans living in the country. The administrative stay provides a one-week reprieve, preventing the revocation of deportation protections and work permits that were set to expire. The administration argues that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, while opponents and advocacy groups contend the country remains unsafe. This ruling offers a brief but critical pause for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, underscoring the ongoing legal and political battle over their future in the United States.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, nicknamed "Big Dumper," won the 2025 All-Star Home Run Derby, defeating Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero 18-15 in the final round. Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break as the major league leader in home runs, became the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to ever win the competition. After advancing from the first round on a tiebreaker, he bested Oneil Cruz in the semifinals to reach the final. Raleigh is the second player from the Mariners to win the title, following in the footsteps of three-time champion Ken Griffey Jr., creating a memorable moment for the breakout slugger.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Animals Can React to Sounds Produced by Plants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at Tel Aviv University have discovered the first evidence that animals respond to sounds made by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown ecosystem of communication. The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. While these sounds are beyond the range of human hearing, they can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. This groundbreaking research suggests that animals may use these plant-generated sounds to make crucial decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter, opening a new field of scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and putting the country on track to meet its annual growth target of 5%. This stronger-than-expected performance may reduce pressure on Beijing to implement further large-scale stimulus measures. However, the data also revealed signs of weakness, as retail sales growth slowed and the slump in real estate investment continued to deepen. While industrial output was robust, officials acknowledged that domestic demand remains insufficient and external economic factors present ongoing uncertainty for the nation's economy.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in advanced aircraft engines. The method, developed at Dalian University of Technology, allows for faster cooling of the forged metal, which enhances the quality and durability of the discs. This breakthrough is crucial for China's ambitions to develop high-performance engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations. The ability to produce more resilient turbine discs is key to increasing an engine's power, efficiency, and overall lifespan.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ contended that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not grant nationwide immunity to potential co-conspirators like Maxwell, who was not even a known party at the time. This move seeks to uphold her 2021 conviction on charges of aiding in the sexual abuse of underage girls.</p>
