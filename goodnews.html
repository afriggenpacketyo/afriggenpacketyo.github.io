          <p>China's economy is currently defined by a stark contrast between sluggish consumer sentiment and rapid technological advancement, particularly in artificial intelligence. While pessimism persists regarding post-Covid economic recovery, Chinese companies like Honor and Huawei are leveraging AI to innovate in smartphone manufacturing and industrial applications such as mining. This AI integration is not limited to major tech firms, as it also penetrates less flashy sectors and spreads growth to smaller cities, signaling a complex and pivotal phase for the nation's development.

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a high-profile socialist primary victory in New York, the future leaders of the Democratic Party are more likely to be pragmatic, center-left figures like Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger.

The piece suggests that while progressive activism is valuable, the path to building durable governing majorities lies in persuasion and consensus, not performative politics.</p>

          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a quintessential element of American culture, traces its origins back to the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean islands. The word itself is an evolution of the Ta√≠no term "barabicu," which referred to the wooden frames they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century, and the practice has since transformed into the diverse regional styles of barbecue celebrated across the United States today, especially during summer holidays.</p>
