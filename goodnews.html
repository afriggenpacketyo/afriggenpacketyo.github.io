          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to their power hitting. Shohei Ohtani contributed a two-run homer in the first inning, while Will Smith added two solo home runs, boosting his National League-leading batting average. This performance provided a much-needed lift for the team's offense, which has been struggling recently. However, the win was somewhat marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott, who left the game in the ninth inning with an apparent arm issue.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a new sanctions regime aimed at disrupting the operations of people-smuggling gangs facilitating illegal Channel crossings. This strategy will target gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies involved in the trade by freezing their assets and imposing travel bans. The move is a central part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to "smash the gangs" amid rising numbers of small boat crossings. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the action targets those who prey on vulnerable people for profit.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that a new round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia is scheduled to take place in Istanbul on Wednesday. This development follows recent threats of new sanctions against Russia by U.S. President Donald Trump if a ceasefire is not achieved. The talks represent another attempt to end the war, which has been ongoing for over three years. While Ukraine is hopeful, the Kremlin has downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough, citing the two sides' opposing positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have an unintended positive consequence. The economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing domestic protectionism and inefficiencies, the tariff crisis could be acting as a catalyst for these nations to pursue internal reforms that ultimately free up their own economies and boost commerce.

          <p>Texas officials have provided a positive update following the deadly July Fourth floods, confirming that most of the more than 160 people initially reported missing have been located and are safe. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, primarily in the popular tourist area of Kerr County.
