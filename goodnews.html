          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India on targets within Pakistani-controlled territory, Indian markets have shown remarkable resilience, fueled by optimism surrounding India's growth prospects and strong macro fundamentals. Investors appear to be focusing on structural reforms, resilient domestic demand, and progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K. Experts anticipate potential near-term volatility but expect a gradual recovery, contingent on whether the situation escalates into a full-fledged conflict or remains a limited defense strike. The article also references the Pulwama attack in 2019, noting a similar contained reaction from investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican state representative in Texas has introduced the Forbidden Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Educational Spaces (FURRIES) Act, aiming to ban students from acting like animals in schools. The bill follows claims, largely unsubstantiated, that schools are accommodating students who identify as animals, including providing litter boxes. Critics argue that the bill is a cynical attempt to attack public schools and justify defunding them, diverting attention from more pressing issues such as school shootings.</p>

          <p>Trust is fraying in modern society, but it is a necessary component in every relationship. Research shows that when deciding whether to trust someone, people generally make judgments about their competence, benevolence, and integrity. People are born inherently trustful, but distrust is a unique experience, shaped by past experiences throughout life, especially childhood. Three easy ways to foster trust, according to a psychologist, are to approach differences with curiosity, embrace a team mindset, and lean into transparency.</p>
