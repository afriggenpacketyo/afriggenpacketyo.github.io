          <p>In a speech to the Israeli Knesset, President Donald Trump celebrated the release of the final 20 living hostages as part of a ceasefire agreement he helped broker. Excerpts from his speech describe the day as one of "profound joy" and the "historic dawn of a new Middle East." The address took place after Trump met with the families of the released hostages alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Following the speech, Trump was scheduled to attend an international peace summit in Egypt to sign an agreement with other world leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the last living Israeli hostages are released, the article reflects on the profound psychological torment and resilience of those held captive, using the story of Eli Sharabi as a central example. Sharabi, who endured 491 days in Hamas tunnels, learned upon his release that his wife and daughters were murdered on October 7. His memoir details the brutal conditions of captivity, including malnutrition, sensory deprivation, and psychological torture. Despite this, he and other hostages, like Hersh Goldberg-Polin, found the will to survive by focusing on a purpose for living, a concept borrowed from Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension and subsequent return of Jimmy Kimmel to his late-night show is presented as evidence of the genre's enduring cultural and political relevance. After Disney suspended Kimmel for comments about Trump supporters, a significant public backlash from celebrities, politicians, and viewers pressured the company to reverse its decision. His return episode drew massive viewership, demonstrating a strong public appetite for the political satire offered by hosts like Kimmel and Stephen Colbert. The article argues that this event has energized late-night television, proving its unique power to speak truth to power in a fragmented media landscape.</p>

          <p>England and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Latvia due to an injury. The 29-year-old was substituted at halftime during the recent 3-0 victory over Wales after scoring a goal and then colliding with the post. While manager Thomas Tuchel initially stated Watkins was "OK," the player has since returned to his club for treatment and will not travel to Riga. His absence presents a selection challenge, with options to fill the central forward role including Anthony Gordon or Marcus Rashford.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to economists Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. Their research has reshaped the understanding of technological progress and prosperity, with a particular focus on the concept of "creative destruction," where new innovations replace older technologies. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences highlighted that the laureates' work demonstrates that sustained growth is not guaranteed and requires an environment that fosters continuous innovation. This prize concludes this year's series of Nobel awards.</p>

          <h2>Economic Think Tank Advises UK Chancellor Against 'Half-Baked' Tax Solutions in Upcoming Budget</h2>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has urged UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid superficial tax adjustments in the next Budget, as she faces pressure to raise funds to meet fiscal rules. The think tank suggests that while tens of billions could be raised without breaking manifesto promises, options like a wealth tax present significant challenges. The IFS recommends broader, principled reforms to the tax system, such as overhauling property and capital gains taxes, to create a fairer and more growth-friendly economic environment. The Treasury responded that the Budget will balance funding public services with encouraging growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation has announced a $50 million donation to four of Atlanta's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The 10-year commitment will fund "gap scholarships" for nearly 10,000 students at Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College. This financial aid is designed to help students who are in good academic standing but face financial hardship as they approach graduation, aiming to increase completion rates. The donation from the Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner is the foundation's largest ever to Georgia's HBCUs.</p>

          <p>A $1 million Powerball prize from the September 6 drawing has been claimed by The September 18 Trust Agreement of Middletown, Rhode Island. The winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven convenience store located on North Main Street in Natick, Massachusetts. The trustee, Cristina Offenberg, collected the prize at the state lottery headquarters. While Massachusetts law does not permit lottery winners to remain anonymous, establishing a trust allows the prize to be claimed in the trust's name, providing a degree of privacy. The store that sold the ticket will receive a $10,000 bonus.</p>

          <p>In a prominent editorial, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, has called for the nation to achieve breakthroughs in key "choke-point" technologies to ensure its competitive edge and avoid dependency on other countries. The commentary emphasizes the importance of independent innovation and self-reliance, particularly as trade tensions with the United States escalate. The article frames each technological advance as a victory over external suppression, fostering a national spirit of resilience and determination. This call to action comes as Beijing prepares to detail its upcoming five-year economic plan.</p>

          <p>A story from NPR's "My Unsung Hero" series recounts how a college student named Silvana Clark was able to continue her education thanks to the secret generosity of her drama professor, George Meshke. In 1971, facing financial hardship and unable to afford her second semester, Clark informed Meshke she would have to drop out. Two days later, he told her she had unexpectedly received a drama scholarship that would cover her tuition. Clark later discovered from the financial aid office that no such scholarship existed, realizing that her professor had paid the fees himself, an act of kindness she never forgot.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement brokered by Donald Trump has initiated the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The first phase involves the release of 20 living hostages and the remains of 28 deceased ones, in return for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees. The deal also includes an increase in aid to Gaza and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, with a multinational force monitoring the ceasefire. Subsequent phases of the plan, which call for the demilitarization of Gaza and its governance by a transitional committee, face significant hurdles, including Hamas's refusal to disarm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa is currently debating the decriminalization of sex work, a move supported by advocacy groups like SWEAT but opposed by others who cite moral and safety concerns. Proponents argue that criminalization makes the industry dangerous, exposing the country's estimated 150,000 sex workers to violence, police harassment, and health risks, while hindering efforts to combat human trafficking. A 2022 decriminalization bill has stalled, prompting a dual legal strategy that now includes challenging the constitutionality of existing laws in court. The Western Cape High Court has granted a temporary moratorium on prosecuting sex workers until a major trial begins in May 2026.</p>
