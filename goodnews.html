        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain and debilitating symptoms, which stumped his medical team for months. After contracting COVID-19 in December 2023, Mauceri developed severe swelling and fatigue, leading to a search for a diagnosis involving multiple specialists. Cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens, hindering its function. Open-heart surgery confirmed the diagnosis, and the removal of the scarred pericardium led to a miraculous recovery, allowing Mauceri to return to conducting. This article reflects a positive outcome, therefore the optimism score is relatively high.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering nuclear power as part of a broader strategy to achieve energy independence. Denmark is analyzing the potential of advanced nuclear technologies, while Spain is reportedly open to reviewing nuclear plant shutdowns, and Germany has softened its opposition to atomic power. This shift is driven by the costs associated with renewable energy sources like solar and wind, prompting countries to explore nuclear as a complementary energy source. However, concerns about safety and waste management remain key considerations in the decision-making process. The optimism score is moderate as this indicates a shift towards a stable energy source.</p>

Earps stated she has given everything to the team and hopes for systemic change in the sport. The optimism score is relatively high as it indicates a positive change for the future.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's aversion to wind power, some Texas Republicans are supporting renewable energy development, recognizing its economic benefits for rural areas.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025 to 1.2%, with a further rise to 1.4% in 2026, citing a strong economic recovery in the first three months of the year.

The IMF praised the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans, but cautioned that global trade tensions and financial market volatility could reduce growth.

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, while shipments from China fell 76%, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans. This shift is driven by Apple's efforts to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China. However, growth in India's iPhone shipments is expected to slow down, with manufacturing capacity not expected to meet U.S. demand until 2026. Analysts suggest that protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity.
