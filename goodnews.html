          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The decision finalizes the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay to the families of the victims who were harassed and threatened by his followers. Jones had argued the trial violated his free speech rights, but courts found him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress. His lawyers had told the Supreme Court that the massive judgment could never realistically be paid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. Current average HELOC rates have fallen below 8%, making it one of the cheaper borrowing options available in today's market. The article suggests that a rate around 7.84% or lower can be considered a good deal, though this is subject to change as market conditions evolve. To secure the lowest possible rate, homeowners are advised to maintain a strong credit score, shop around with multiple lenders, and ensure they have a healthy debt-to-income ratio.

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company has filed a federal lawsuit against grocery chain Trader Joe's, alleging trademark infringement over its popular "Uncrustables" product. The suit claims that Trader Joe's pre-made, crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches copy the distinctive round, crimped-edge design and packaging of Uncrustables, causing consumer confusion. Smucker's is seeking a court order to stop Trader Joe's from selling the product and is demanding financial compensation for any profits gained from the alleged infringement. The lawsuit underscores the company's efforts to protect what it describes as a brand on track to be worth $1 billion.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs announced better-than-expected third-quarter financial results, with revenue rising nearly 20% year-over-year to $15.18 billion and earnings per share increasing by almost 46%. The strong performance was driven by a significant surge in investment banking activity, particularly in advisory and underwriting services. The firm's leadership expressed optimism about the dealmaking landscape, citing a more supportive regulatory environment and a renewed focus on long-term strategic decisions among clients. The positive report signals a potential rebound in M&A and IPO activity heading into the new year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, may end in the coming months. In a speech, Powell noted that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening, signaling that the Fed is nearing its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for the banking system. While he provided no new long-term guidance on interest rates, he acknowledged that downside risks to employment appear to have risen in a softer labor market. The remarks indicate a cautious approach as the Fed navigates the balance between its employment and inflation goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Other accessible options include silver-backed ETFs, which offer instant liquidity on stock exchanges, and pre-1965 U.S. "junk silver" coins, which are easily sold for their melt value.

          <p>In an effort to prevent another catastrophic wildfire, California authorities are implementing a large-scale fire prevention project in the Santa Monica Mountains. The strategy involves creating miles of fuel breaks using remote-controlled machinery to clear native chaparral, along with deploying hundreds of goats and sheep to graze on flammable invasive grasses. This proactive approach aims to protect vulnerable communities like Topanga. However, some fire ecologists express concern that, if not managed carefully, clearing native vegetation could inadvertently make the landscape even more prone to fire in the long term.</p>

          <p>Recent research highlights a significant values gap between Generation Z and hiring managers, creating friction in the modern workplace. The study found that Gen Z's top priorities are self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping others. In contrast, employers are primarily looking for candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work, leading to what some executives describe as a hiring challenge. This disconnect reflects a broader generational debate over work-life balance and career priorities, with younger workers rejecting traditional corporate values that they feel have led to negative societal outcomes.</p>

          <p>For consumers overwhelmed by credit card debt, debt forgiveness can be a potential path to relief, though it comes with significant risks. While there are no specific government-sponsored forgiveness programs, individuals can pursue options like debt settlement, where a company negotiates with creditors to accept a lower lump-sum payment. Another, more drastic option is bankruptcy, which can eliminate debt but severely damages one's credit. The article also outlines alternatives such as debt consolidation loans and financial hardship programs offered directly by credit card companies, which may provide relief with fewer long-term consequences.

Dawson, who has been growing giant pumpkins for five years, attributed his success to precision watering and sunlight management, skills he says are aided by his engineering background.
