          <p>Hedge fund giant Citadel, led by billionaire Ken Griffin, has reported positive returns for all its funds in the first half of 2025, navigating a volatile market. The firm's largest fund, Wellington, gained 2.5%, while its tactical trading fund saw a 6.1% increase. These gains occurred despite market turbulence from trade policies and geopolitical conflict, with the S&P 500 still managing to reach record highs.

          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector experienced a rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a significant financial burden to the industry. Following the news, the Invesco Solar ETF saw a 4% increase, and shares of companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies jumped. Despite this positive development, industry groups caution that the overall legislation remains harmful to the renewable energy sector's future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new SmartAsset study has identified the best job markets in the United States by analyzing factors like unemployment rates, income growth, and work-life balance across 348 cities. Bend, Oregon, claimed the top spot due to its low unemployment and significant income growth, along with a short median commute time. The report also highlights cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employee health coverage, and Wichita Falls, Texas, for having one of the nation's shortest commutes. Frisco, Texas, was noted for its high percentage of remote workers, contributing to a better work-life balance.</p>

          <p>A beachgoer in Walton County, Florida, discovered a large quantity of cocaine, valued at nearly $500,000, that had washed up on the shore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were found wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office confiscated the drugs and issued a public warning, reminding citizens not to touch suspicious packages and to report them immediately. This incident is the latest in a series of similar discoveries along Florida's coasts, where large bundles of illicit drugs, often in unique packaging, frequently wash ashore.</p>

His campaign, centered on populist ideas and the cost of living, energized a progressive base and has been seen as a potential new blueprint for Democrats.

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to accelerate housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the new rules, which will exempt most "infill housing" projects in urban areas from the lengthy CEQA review process. Proponents, including housing advocates, argue the changes are crucial to remove bureaucratic hurdles that have stifled development. However, environmental and social justice groups have opposed the move, warning it could undermine public participation and increase environmental risks in vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>A professor at NYU's Stern School of Business advises job seekers to ask one specific question to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" According to professor and author Suzy Welch, this question often elicits more honest and revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" can provide genuine insight into work-life balance and expectations. Welch suggests saving this disarming question for the end of the interview process to best assess if the company is a true fit.</p>

Clipper is used by hundreds of thousands of riders daily across the nine-county region.

This article outlines four key mistakes to avoid when considering a HELOC. These include not monitoring the current rate climate, incorrectly assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions, and overborrowing due to the favorable rates compared to alternatives.
