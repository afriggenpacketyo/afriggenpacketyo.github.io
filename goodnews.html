          <p>Taiwan is in a state of uncertainty as it awaits the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States regarding potential tariffs. The Trump administration had previously announced worldwide tariffs, including a 32% rate for Taiwan, but paused them for 90 days to allow for negotiations. While Taiwanese and U.S. officials have met multiple times, no deal has been announced yet. Analysts suggest the continued talks are a positive sign that both sides are working towards a manageable solution, which is crucial for Taiwan as a major supplier of advanced semiconductors to top American tech firms.</p>

          <p>The FBI has secured dozens of convictions in a massive $250 million fraud scheme in Minnesota that exploited a federal child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic. FBI Director Kash Patel described the "Feeding our Future" case as one of the worst in the state's history, where conspirators created fake food distribution sites and laundered money intended to feed hungry children. So far, 70 people have been indicted and 38 have pleaded guilty to using the funds for personal luxuries like mansions and cars. The investigation remains ongoing, with officials vowing to hold all those who betrayed the public trust accountable.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans detained in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, have been released and are returning to the U.S. as part of a complex prisoner exchange involving the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador send 252 Venezuelan nationals, who were deported from the U.S. and accused of gang ties, from its CECOT prison to Venezuela. In return, Venezuela also freed dozens of its own political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as a "down-to-the-wire" humanitarian deal that secured the freedom of every American wrongfully detained in the country.</p>

          <h2>Poll Finds Broad American Support for a Return to the Moon and a Mission to Mars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also shows that the 1969 moon landing is still viewed by a large majority as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These positive public sentiments for space exploration cut across most political and ideological lines, suggesting a broad consensus on the value of the nation's space program.</p>

          <p>The new U.S. Postmaster General, David Steiner, has publicly stated that he does not believe the U.S. Postal Service should be privatized. In his first message to employees, he affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity within the executive branch, easing concerns raised by his previous role at FedEx. His statement was welcomed by postal union leaders, who have been protesting calls from some administration officials to overhaul or sell off the agency. The declaration provides a degree of stability and direction for the future of the nation's mail service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the "GENIUS Act" into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, allows banks and other financial institutions to issue stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars, a move proponents say will strengthen the dollar and modernize the financial system. At the signing ceremony, the president hailed the law as a potential "greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet." The act is seen by the administration and the crypto industry as a crucial step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix's recent strong quarterly performance, which showed significant growth in revenue and subscribers, is being viewed as a positive indicator for its competitor, Disney. Netflix's success in implementing price hikes and growing its ad-supported tier suggests that consumers are still willing to pay for premium streaming content, a welcome sign for Disney as it pursues a similar strategy for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. The results demonstrate that major platforms can increase prices and advertising income without significant subscriber loss, providing a favorable read-through for Disney's own direct-to-consumer profitability goals ahead of its upcoming earnings report.

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim that it had a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. The outcome is a major strategic victory for Chevron and resolves the uncertainty that had been weighing on its stock. The ruling also affirms a standard industry practice that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers and acquisitions.</p>
