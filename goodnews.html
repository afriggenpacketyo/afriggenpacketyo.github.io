          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong first-round showing, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceding the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on momentum gained through social media and younger voters, despite no candidate reaching the 50% threshold for an outright win. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign, conceding before the ranked-choice votes were fully tabulated and suggesting a possible independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with comprehensive results expected on July 15, to determine the Democratic nominee in a city where the primary winner is heavily favored in the general election.</p>

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has praised Trump for securing increased defense spending commitments from European members, reaching a 5% of GDP target. Despite this progress, Trump has cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause, Article 5, while Rutte urged partners to focus on strengthening their own defenses.

          <p>A Chinese-led study proposes creating an interconnected global solar-wind energy network to meet the world's energy demands by 2050. The network would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers suggest optimizing solar and wind renewable energy deployment across continents, navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and provide resilience against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative agreement on a $321-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12-billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funding. The budget continues the practice of sparing state programs from immediate cuts while avoiding long-term financial problems, and includes reduced healthcare expansion to undocumented immigrants and reinstated asset limits for Medi-Cal enrollees. The agreement hinges on passing a bill that would lessen the number of building projects requiring full environmental review under CEQA.</p>
