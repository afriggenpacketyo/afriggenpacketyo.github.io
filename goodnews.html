          <p>A new Microsoft report, "Occupational Implications of Generative AI," suggests that blue-collar professions are the least impacted by artificial intelligence, offering greater job stability compared to white-collar roles. The analysis, based on 200,000 anonymized conversations with Microsoft Bing Copilot, found that AI primarily assists with information gathering, writing, and communication, making roles like interpreters and writers more vulnerable. Occupations requiring physical work or direct human interaction, such as painters, nursing assistants, and plumbers, are deemed safer from AI automation. Experts note these roles are also growing in demand and increasingly require technical knowledge.</p>

Jorgenson's relentless attacks and efforts to exhaust Pogačar, even while battling bronchitis, were crucial in the final stage. His selfless work allowed teammate Wout van Aert to ultimately win a stage, demonstrating that Pogačar, though dominant, could still be pressured. Jorgenson's performance, though not resulting in a personal victory, was a testament to his agonizing and well-executed team role.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new trade agreement with Pakistan, which includes U.S. assistance in developing Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves" and lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the U.S. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed the deal, calling it a "win-win" situation. Details regarding specific tariff rates and the chosen oil company remain unclear. This development follows Trump's recent imposition of a 25% tariff on India, which he criticized for high tariffs and trade with Russia, contrasting it with the new partnership with Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke revealed that Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia and a new airline, Air Borneo, are interested in purchasing China's C919 passenger jet. This interest stems from growing air travel demand in Southeast Asia and significant delivery backlogs from traditional manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. China is actively promoting its Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) aircraft, including the C919, as more affordable and readily available alternatives. Airlines are seeking to diversify their fleets and accelerate aircraft procurement to meet increasing operational needs.</p>
