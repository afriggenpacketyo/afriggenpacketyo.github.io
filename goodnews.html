          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner refrained from confirming whether the government intends to eliminate the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Rayner highlighted the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce, which is evaluating the cap as part of a broader assessment of challenges. She emphasized a comprehensive approach, citing plans to accelerate housebuilding as an example of tackling child poverty. Rayner also denied leaking a memo suggesting child benefit payment clawbacks from wealthier families and dismissed claims of internal Labour discord, affirming government solidarity.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the inaugural nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. While the government heralds this as a "new dawn for rail," it stops short of promising fare reductions, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Concerns from unions persist regarding outsourcing of staffing for security and cleaning to private companies. The opposition Conservatives urge Labour to fulfill its promises. The DfT Operator will integrate SWR trains into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>Volunteers are actively working to restore the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve by removing invasive plant species, particularly black mustard, which crowds out native plants crucial for the ecosystem's health. The removal efforts aim to enhance biodiversity, improve carbon capture, and enhance the filtration of runoff entering the Los Angeles River. The habitat restoration events have seen increased participation, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire to contribute to tangible solutions. The environmental group hopes that with continued effort, crucial areas of the reserve will be largely cleared of the weed.</p>

          <p>Financial columnist Liz Weston answers questions about inherited IRAs and retirement planning. The SECURE Act significantly altered the rules for inherited IRAs, generally requiring them to be drained within 10 years, though spouses have some additional options. Weston advises a reader on strategies to catch up on retirement savings, emphasizing the importance of delaying Social Security benefits and finding an employer with a 401(k) match. She also addresses a query about capital gains taxes on selling a home to move into assisted living, suggesting installment sales, renting, or home equity loans as potential solutions (not investment advice).</p>
