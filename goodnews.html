        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UK-EU deal addresses several concerns regarding holidays, jobs, and trade, but leaves some questions unanswered. The agreement includes dedicated dialogues on professional qualification recognition, but a full agreement may take time. While the deal clarifies e-gate usage for UK citizens at EU ports, it may not be implemented before a new EU border security scheme in October, potentially leading to continued queues. Pet passport resumption timing remains uncertain, while UK farmers will need to align with EU food standards, and the deal recognizes the value of touring artists, though concrete commitments are still sought. Finally, the agreement is expected to boost the UK economy by around ¬£9 billion a year, mainly from food, farming, and energy trading.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its previous order to halt construction on Equinor's offshore wind farm in New York, allowing the project to proceed. This decision follows an apparent compromise with the state regarding a gas pipeline.

Governor Kathy Hochul announced the reversal, noting the project supports 1,500 union jobs, and Equinor aims to commence commercial operations in 2027. </p>

          <p>The gold-silver ratio, which measures the amount of silver needed to purchase one ounce of gold, is a key metric for precious metal investors. A high ratio suggests silver may be undervalued compared to gold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Currently, with gold around $3,200 per ounce and silver around $32, the ratio is high, nearing 100 to 1. Experts recommend using the ratio as a guide alongside understanding the volatility and diversification roles of both metals, noting that while gold is a stronger hedge against inflation, silver is more cost-effective but also more volatile.

          <p>For seniors seeking to tap into their home equity, HELOCs and reverse mortgages present different advantages and disadvantages. HELOCs offer flexible financing with lower interest rates, suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation, provided borrowers can manage monthly payments. Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, allow seniors to access equity without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income, but come with higher fees and erode home equity over time. Experts advise considering individual financial situations and consulting professionals to determine the most suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joan C. Williams argues that Democrats have a historic opportunity to regain the support of the working class, who have increasingly shifted towards right-wing populism. She contends that the left has moved away from focusing on economic stability for blue-collar workers and adopted a style that resonates more with college-educated elites. Williams suggests that Democrats need to emphasize "predistribution" policies that ensure fair wages and job opportunities, rather than relying solely on redistributive social programs. Trump's policies, such as tariffs and attacks on social security, have created an opening for Democrats to appeal to working-class voters. </p>
