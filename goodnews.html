Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' George Russell secured third and fourth positions, respectively. The session was interrupted by a red flag for a loose kerb, which inadvertently benefited Piastri by allowing time to fix an engine problem. Lewis Hamilton also encountered issues, clipping a wall and damaging his front wing, highlighting the challenging nature of the circuit.</p>

          <p>Apple's iPhone 17 launched globally to queues from Beijing to London, but the company faces significant pressure from Chinese rivals and doubts over its artificial intelligence strategy. Despite strong initial preorder demand in China, Apple's market share in the region has fallen to 10%, trailing local players. New models like the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and Air, along with updated Apple Watch and AirPods, are now available. A successful launch is crucial for Apple to reassure investors after a perceived underwhelming AI rollout, with analysts emphasizing the need for the company to deliver on AI promises.</p>

The couple, aged 80 and 76, were freed through Qatari mediation, following their arrest while traveling in February. They are expected to fly to Qatar for medical checks before returning to the UK, despite having lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades. Their release follows months of public advocacy from their family and concerns about their rapidly deteriorating health in prison.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand apparel market, valued at $227 billion in 2024, is booming, driven by Gen Z and millennial consumers seeking sustainability and unique style. While resale promises to reduce fashion's significant environmental impact, experts warn that its rapid growth and adoption of fast-fashion sales tactics risk reintroducing overconsumption habits. Studies show that not all secondhand purchases replace new items, and wearing clothes longer, regardless of origin, is the most effective way to reduce emissions. Brands are urged to be transparent about production volumes and set displacement targets to ensure thrifting genuinely contributes to a more sustainable future.</p>

          <p>In the rural pockets of Texas, six-man football offers high schools with fewer than 105 students a unique version of the sport, becoming a crucial source of community pride and identity. Played on a shorter, narrower field with distinct rules like four-point field goals, the game is described as fast-paced and exhilarating. For these small towns, where the school often serves as the community's hub, Friday night games are a cherished tradition that brings people together across generations. Despite concerns about declining enrollment threatening the sport's future in some areas, six-man football remains a deeply ingrained cultural rite of passage.</p>

The legislation seeks to replace what critics describe as ugly, brutalist structures with architecture that inspires pride and reflects American values. The article argues that beautiful, dignified public buildings are achievable and fiscally responsible, citing examples like the Tuscaloosa Federal Building. A 2020 survey indicated that 72% of Americans prefer traditional designs, suggesting broad public support for this architectural shift.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan maintained its policy rate at 0.5% on Friday, aligning with economist forecasts, as Japan's core inflation rate fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest since November 2024. This marks the third consecutive month of decline for core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices. The BOJ's cautious stance prioritizes stability amid slowing inflation and global uncertainty, differing from Western central banks. While some call for rate hikes due to inflation remaining above the 2% target, others argue high headline inflation is distorted by supply constraints and exogenous factors.
