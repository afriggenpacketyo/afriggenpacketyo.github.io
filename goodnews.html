          <p>Gage Wood of Arkansas pitched the first College World Series no-hitter in 65 years, striking out a record 19 batters in a 3-0 victory against Murray State. Wood's performance was nearly perfect, with his bid for a perfect game ending only when he hit a batter in the eighth inning. Coach Dave Van Horn praised Wood's execution and the team's defensive plays behind him, highlighting Wood's progression from closer to weekend starter. The Razorbacks will continue in the elimination bracket, while Murray State concludes their first CWS appearance with two losses. The final out was a grounder snagged by first baseman Reese Robinett. The team celebrated Wood's achievement after the game, marking a historic moment in CWS history, with Wood giving the game ball to his dad for Father's Day. The score is based on the author's positive reflection of the historic baseball game.</p>
