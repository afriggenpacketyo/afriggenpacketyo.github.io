          <p>Ten American citizens detained in Venezuela are on their way back to the United States following a complex, three-way prisoner exchange, announced by U.S. officials. The intricate deal involved not only the U.S. and Venezuela but also El Salvador, which released 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been previously deported from the U.S. to a notorious prison. This arrangement was crucial for securing the freedom of the Americans, a group that includes a former Navy SEAL who was detained last year while on personal travel. The swap represents a significant diplomatic maneuver, resolving a tense hostage situation for multiple American families.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, the first significant federal law to regulate cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan bill primarily establishes a framework for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, aiming to increase their accessibility and public trust. The legislation's passage follows a push from the president to position the U.S. as a global crypto leader, though some Democrats have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's own crypto ventures.

          <p>The cryptocurrency Ether saw its price surge following President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act, a new law establishing regulations for stablecoins. Ether's gains outpaced Bitcoin, with its associated ETFs seeing record inflows, signaling a potential shift in market leadership within the crypto space. Analysts suggest the new law provides significant symbolic and practical validation for the industry, creating a more stable regulatory environment. The legislation is expected to embed stablecoins more deeply into the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the region. While Exxon stated it respects the ruling, its shares fell on the news, whereas Chevron's CEO celebrated the outcome as a confirmation of standard industry practices in corporate mergers. The integration is expected to result in some job reductions as the two companies combine operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bat flying into the NBC broadcast tower during the second round of The Open Championship caused a moment of humorous chaos for the announcers. While commentating on the golf tournament, Dan Hicks and Kevin Kisner were startled by the unexpected visitor. Their contrasting reactions, with Hicks waving his hands wildly and Kisner ducking under his jacket for cover, provided a lighthearted interruption to the sports coverage. The incident was later replayed and humorously narrated by fellow announcer Mike Tirico.</p>

          <p>At a White House ceremony, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major U.S. regulatory framework for stablecoins. The president celebrated the bill as a "massive validation" for the cryptocurrency community, suggesting it could spark a revolution in financial technology. He recounted persuading holdout Republicans to support the bill, which aims to provide clear rules for banks and financial institutions to issue dollar-backed digital assets. The event also highlighted other legislative moves, including a bill to prevent a retail central bank digital currency.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is likely to sign the European Union's new voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, while Meta Platforms has stated it will not. The code is designed to help companies comply with the EU's landmark AI Act by providing guidelines on transparency, such as publishing summaries of data used to train AI models. Microsoft's president expressed support for the EU's direct engagement with industry on the matter. In contrast, Meta's chief global affairs officer argued that the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the AI Act, potentially stifling innovation in Europe.</p>

          <p>This article provides a brief history of queerness, exploring how non-binary gender identities and same-sex relationships were viewed in different societies throughout time. It highlights examples from antiquity, such as the accepted male relationships in ancient Greece and Rome, and notes figures like Leonardo da Vinci, who is believed to have had a male companion. The text contrasts this with the severe persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which framed such relationships as a "crime against nature." The article also discusses the historical existence of a "third gender" in various cultures, long before modern terminology.</p>

          <p>American Express reported a 7% jump in total spending on its cards for the second quarter, indicating its affluent customer base continues to spend freely. However, the company noted a specific weak spot in airline spending, which was flat compared to the previous year. The weakness is concentrated in economy class domestic airfare, while premium cabin and high-cost hotel bookings remain strong. This trend, along with falling airfare prices, could be a concern for the company given its extensive airline partnerships and network of airport lounges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent slump in its stock price partly due to accelerating beef inflation, the long-term outlook for Texas Roadhouse remains strong, according to some analysts. A Bank of America report noted that beef prices rose about 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, putting pressure on the steakhouse chain's operating margins. However, the bank raised its price target for the stock, citing expectations that the company will continue to gain market share and post strong traffic trends. The analysis suggests that while commodity prices are a short-term headwind, the fundamental business trajectory remains positive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Author Claims to Have Solved 500-Year-Old Mystery of the Princes in the Tower</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British author Philippa Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, now claims to have solved the historical mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London in the 15th century. Contrary to the popular narrative that Richard III had his nephews murdered to secure the throne, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly unearthed evidence that both boys survived. Her research suggests the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda. The claim, detailed in a new book, challenges a 500-year-old belief, though some historians remain skeptical.</p>
