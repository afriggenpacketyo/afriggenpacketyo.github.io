          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana, where he had been held for over 100 days. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. Upon arrival, Khalil accused the Trump administration of dehumanizing immigrants and suppressing pro-Palestine voices, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. The judge ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, but left open the possibility of deportation proceedings based on issues with his green card application. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome of his release while acknowledging the ongoing legal challenges he faces.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Sophie Cunningham criticized the WNBA and its referees for not adequately protecting teammate Caitlin Clark, referencing her recent hard foul on a Connecticut Sun player who poked Clark in the eye. Cunningham stated that the referees' lack of protection for Clark has been a recurring issue since she entered the league, highlighting controversial incidents where Clark was roughed up without fouls being called. She has gained popularity for taking matters into her own hands to protect Clark, earning the nickname "the enforcer" for the Fever. The article also mentions former NBA player Joakim Noah's suggestion that the Fever acquire a player to protect Clark, emphasizing the need for enforcement on the court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation, preventing policy changes that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the NSF's change to cap indirect costs at 15% was arbitrary and unlawful, which the University of California estimated would cost it nearly $100 million annually. The cuts would have impacted expenses such as building maintenance and computer systems, threatening critical research in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The ruling aligns with similar blocks against funding caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House, signaling warming ties between Washington and Moscow's ally, Belarus. The release occurred after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, which was the highest-profile visit of a U.S. official in years. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, and Lukashenko's spokeswoman said the release was at Mr. Trump's request. The freed prisoners have been transferred to Lithuania, and while none needed emergency medical assistance, one required attention due to difficult imprisonment conditions.</p>

The practice has implemented upgrades like a call-back option to improve the process, and the government has pledged additional funding to general practices to address the issue.

The band members, born at the start of the millennium, draw inspiration from older siblings and friends who introduced them to Y2K-era music and culture. South Arcade gained traction through TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts, and they have found success in capturing a nostalgic feeling in their music. The band emphasizes the appeal of Y2K culture as a form of escapism, where bedrooms were personalized with posters and collectibles, offering a contrast to the minimalism of modern phone-centric culture.</p>

Originally, ten statues were made, and while some may have been destroyed, others have remained on display in unexpected locations, such as a McDonald's in the Netherlands and a nightclub in Austria. The statue at the McDonald's was removed in 2019 following the Leaving Neverland documentary, while the one in Austria is now for sale after the club closed, and one is located in a Swiss fairground. The statues serve as a reminder of Jackson's global impact and the enduring fascination with his legacy.</p>

Under the plans, new recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, and former armed services personnel would be offered a ¬£20,000 payment if they return to serve two additional years. The proposed scheme would be limited to 3,000 personnel, with its ¬£60m cost covered by the main defence budget.</p>
