          <p>In an effort to break a deadlock with Washington, Iran has proposed creating a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, according to Iranian officials. This plan, presented to American special envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. The proposal aims to offer a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could allow President Trump to claim a more substantial agreement. However, the feasibility of such a venture, given the strained relations between Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>As President Trump reduces funding for American research institutions, countries worldwide are actively recruiting disenchanted U.S. researchers with promises of greater academic freedom and financial support. The European Union, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Britain, Canada, Portugal, Austria, and Australia are among those offering incentives ranging from increased funding to streamlined visa processes. This international effort aims to capitalize on what the Australian Strategic Policy Institute calls a 'once-in-a-century brain gain opportunity,' potentially reshaping the global landscape of scientific research and development.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole. Judge Michael Jesic cited their extensive rehabilitation efforts and contributions to prison programs, including hospice care for inmates, as factors in his decision. The brothers expressed remorse for their actions, acknowledging the pain they caused their family and the brutality of their crimes. The Los Angeles County District Attorney opposed the resentencing, but the judge ultimately determined that the brothers no longer posed an unreasonable risk to public safety.</p>

The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, expressed remorse and accepted responsibility for their actions.

The decision follows a recommendation from the previous District Attorney and sets the stage for a parole process that could take years, although clemency from the governor remains a possibility.</p>

A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president and stated that 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity'.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has changed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and others, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame. Rose was banned for gambling on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The new policy states that bans expire upon death, leading to the reinstatement of several deceased players involved in the Black Sox scandal.

His focus is on how Democrats can win back working-class voters, men, and disenchanted Americans who voted for Trump.
