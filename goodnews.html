          <p>Exit polls indicate that Lee Jae Myung of the liberal Democratic Party is leading in South Korea's presidential election, which was triggered by the removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee secured 51.7 percent of the vote, ahead of Kim Moon Soo of the conservative People Power Party and Lee Jun Seok of the New Reform Party. Lee has pledged to revise legislation on martial law and revitalize small and medium-sized businesses, while also strengthening the South Korea-U.S. alliance. The incoming president will face challenges including tariff negotiations with the United States. The election aims to fill the void left by Yoon's impeachment earlier this year. The optimism score for this article reflects a sense of measured anticipation and the potential for change.</p>

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife facing unique challenges, including economic instability and societal pressures that differ from previous generations. Unlike the traditional midlife crisis involving drastic changes, millennials are more likely to seek opportunities for personal growth and reevaluation. The pandemic and economic downturns have contributed to a sense of uncertainty and a longing for stability. However, millennials are also finding support in their communities and embracing new paths that align with their values. The millennial midlife crisis is more about reevaluating progress and seeking fulfillment than abandoning responsibilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the challenge of reducing the climate impact of food production, which accounts for one-third of global emissions. It highlights the need to produce more food with less land to sustain a growing population while protecting carbon sinks. The rich world will need to eat less beef and more plants, while the entire world will need to produce more food with less land. Innovations in agriculture, such as reengineering plants and developing feed additives, offer potential solutions, but more investment and research are needed. This essay has been excerpted from Michael Grunwald‚Äôs forthcoming book, We Are Eating the Earth.</p>
