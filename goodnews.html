        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grandparents are becoming increasingly important in American family life due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the rising cost of childcare. With falling birth rates, grandparents have fewer grandchildren, allowing them to dedicate more time and attention to each child, contributing to deeper relationships. They offer unique benefits, such as fresh perspectives and a more relaxed approach to childcare, and they are also stepping in to fill gaps in America's child care system, though this can create financial and emotional strain. Experts emphasize the need for policies that support grandparents in their caregiving roles, ensuring they can be involved without undue pressure or exhaustion.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has announced its agreement to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange based in Dubai, for $2.9 billion. The deal, comprising $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase stock, aims to position Coinbase as a global leader in crypto derivatives, expanding its reach beyond the U.S. market. Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume last year and boasts about $30 billion in open interest, making it a profitable acquisition for Coinbase as the crypto industry experiences regulatory tailwinds and increased M&A activity. This strategic move diversifies Coinbase's revenue streams and enhances its profitability, with the transaction expected to close by year-end.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a dip after the company released mixed first-quarter results and provided a cautious outlook for the current period. While earnings per share exceeded expectations, the company's guidance for gross profit and revenue growth fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. Shopify's President, Harley Finkelstein, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which could impact the company's predominantly small- to medium-sized business merchants, though he stated the impact is not expected to be meaningful in the near term. Finkelstein emphasized that Shopify's customer base tends to be higher-income consumers who are less price-sensitive, and that the company is actively monitoring data to support merchants through any arising changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates at the Fed's recent meeting, labeling him a "fool" for not cutting rates sooner. This criticism comes as the Bank of England lowered its main interest rate amid concerns over the potential global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell has emphasized the Fed's independence and the importance of insulating it from political influence to make decisions based on economic data. Economists generally agree that central bank independence is crucial for maintaining low inflation and full employment, and some analysts suggest that Trump's pressure on Powell could backfire and force the Fed to proceed cautiously.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move, particularly given elevated interest rates and high consumer debt, but it's not always the best option. While paying off high-interest debt can offer an immediate return and reduce monthly obligations, the decision depends on individual financial situations, goals, and potential alternative uses for the money. It may not be the best move if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively. If you do not have an inheritance, there are debt management and debt consolidation options that may help to reduce what you owe and get back on track.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has announced his opposition to the assisted dying bill in Scotland, citing concerns that it would fundamentally change the relationships between patients and clinicians. Swinney expressed worries that vulnerable individuals might feel pressured to end their lives prematurely, with his religious faith and personal circumstances also influencing his decision. Despite Swinney's stance, the Scottish government will not impede the legislation, and SNP MSPs will have a free vote. Liam McArthur, the Lib Dem MSP proposing the bill, acknowledged Swinney's opposition but remains hopeful for sufficient support in Holyrood.</p>

          <p>Markets rallied as investors awaited a trade agreement between the United States and United Kingdom, with President Trump set to announce the deal from the Oval Office. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced gains in early trading. The deal is expected to be the first in a series of agreements between the U.S. and its key trading partners, but bigger partners like China could present larger hurdles. The Federal Reserve has cited uncertainty around the Trump administration's trade policies as a reason for leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged.</p>
