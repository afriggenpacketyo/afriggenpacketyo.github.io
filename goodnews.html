          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is scheduled to present the initial draft of the 2025 budget. The budget's presentation was delayed due to national elections held in February.

The finance minister's presentation is scheduled for 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT/UTC).</p>

          <p>President Trump took a gamble by involving the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which may have resulted in a ceasefire. While neither Israel nor Iran has confirmed the agreement, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic success. Iran stated it has no intention of continuing its response if Israel ceases aggression, leading to a halt in attacks. This development followed Iranian missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties or damage, and Trump had warned of an overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers have largely praised President Trump following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, highlighting his negotiating skills. Democrats, however, have been more reserved in their response, with some raising concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that Trump's admission of unilaterally engaging the United States in a war without congressional approval is a grave matter. Representative Thomas Massie, who had been pushing for congressional approval before any attack on Iran, said he would not advance the measure further due to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to prevent foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction against the proclamation, which cited national security concerns, after a temporary order was already in place. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against the university for refusing to accede to demands regarding its governance, curriculum, and ideology. The administration had accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, claims the university denies.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China's largest inland city, has evolved into a hub of international trade thanks to the launch of two cross-border rail networks. One network runs west to Germany, and the other extends south to Singapore, providing faster access to global markets. Chongqing aims to become a central node in the global economy, connecting Asia and Europe via rail. This development highlights how China is deepening its global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks, including potential decoupling from the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attacks as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which he said prevented any casualties.

Following the strikes, Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, urging both sides to pursue peace.</p>
