        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reigning champion England Lionesses began their Euro 2025 title defense with a disappointing 2-1 loss to France. Pundits and players noted that the team was "bullied" in midfield and made uncharacteristic errors, leading to two first-half goals for the French side. Despite a late goal from Keira Walsh, England struggled to create chances for most of the match. The defeat puts the Lionesses in a difficult position in their group, facing must-win games against the Netherlands and Wales to ensure they advance to the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>An all-British welterweight boxing match between Jack Catterall and Harlem Eubank ended prematurely when an accidental clash of heads in the sixth round caused a severe cut above Catterall's eye. The bout at Manchester's AO Arena was stopped at the start of the seventh round and went to the judges' scorecards. Catterall was awarded the win by technical decision, having controlled the fight with a cautious, tactical approach. The result marked the first professional defeat for Eubank, who immediately called for a rematch.</p>

          <p>Millennial women are increasingly using online platforms to discuss perimenopause, the often misunderstood transitional stage before menopause, which they dub "puberty 2.0." Many express frustration that the topic was never mentioned in health classes or by doctors, leaving them unprepared for symptoms like irregular periods, mood swings, hormonal acne, and insomnia. The online conversation highlights a shared experience of feeling isolated and struggling to have their health concerns taken seriously by medical professionals. This growing awareness movement aims to break the stigma and better inform women.</p>

          <p>The first complete images of China's new large wing-in-ground effect (WIG) craft, or Ekranoplan, have emerged, offering new insights into its design and potential capabilities. The aircraft, spotted on the Bohai Sea, features a flying-boat hull, a large v-tail, and wingtip floats, drawing comparisons to the Soviet Union's famed "Caspian Sea Monster." Analysts suggest it could be used for logistics, search and rescue, and sea control missions in the littorals, flying low to evade radar. Questions remain about its propulsion system, but the craft represents a significant development in China's military modernization.</p>

          <h2>Career Experts Offer Advice for Young People Seeking Summer Jobs Without Experience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many young people struggle to find summer or part-time jobs due to a lack of previous work experience, creating a frustrating "vicious cycle." To overcome this, career experts advise applicants to highlight transferable skills gained from volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and one page long, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While online applications have increased competition, experts still see value in speculatively dropping off CVs at smaller local businesses to show initiative.</p>

          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA), designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus, is a subject of debate. While some savers praise it as an "excellent product," others are penalized by its strict rules. Key criticisms include a penalty for early withdrawal that erodes personal savings and a property price cap of £450,000, which has not been updated since 2017 despite rising house prices. Financial experts and campaigners are calling for reforms to make the system fairer for young savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee Representative Mark Green has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20, a move that further slims the Republican's already precarious majority in the House. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to launch a business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China. His departure reduces the GOP majority to 219-212, potentially creating more significant challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson in navigating legislative priorities and unifying his conference on key votes.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team delivered a commanding performance to defeat Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata, largely thanks to a powerful second-half surge. After a tight first half, England scored three quick tries, with Tom Roebuck touching down twice. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, masterfully controlled the game, adding crucial penalties to secure the win despite a brief Argentine comeback. The clinical display gives England a strong start to their tour, while the Pumas will need to regroup before the second Test.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has made his first public appearance since the 12-day war with Israel in June, according to Iranian state media.

The appearance came during the mourning month of Muharram, a period he traditionally observes publicly. During the war, which saw Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, signaling a potential breakthrough in the nearly 21-month conflict, though it stated further talks are needed on implementation.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office deemed the changes requested by Hamas "unacceptable" but confirmed it would send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue discussions, reflecting the complex and delicate nature of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards had an exceptionally busy Fourth of July, rescuing 350 people from dangerous surf and strong rip currents.

The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend. The incidents serve as a stark reminder of the power of the ocean, even for experienced swimmers enjoying a holiday at the beach.</p>

The 23-year-old says she compensates for her lack of height with exceptional speed and power, skills she has honed throughout her career. After overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded, Kartal has seen a rapid rise in the world rankings. She will now make her Centre Court debut against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, crediting her success to hard work and self-belief.</p>
