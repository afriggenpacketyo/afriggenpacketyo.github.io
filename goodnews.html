          <h2>New York Lowers Prison Guard Hiring Age Amid Officer Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:08:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York is set to lower the minimum hiring age for prison guards from 21 to 18 in response to a severe correction officer shortage. This shortage was exacerbated by the firing of over 2,000 guards following a strike protesting poor working conditions. The new law will impose restrictions on younger guards, such as prohibiting them from carrying firearms or transporting inmates unsupervised during their first 18 months. This decision follows incidents such as the fatal beating of Robert Brooks and the death of Messiah Nantwi, which led to charges against several guards.</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives passed a Republican-backed bill to limit property ownership by citizens of China, along with those from Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill includes a provision allowing the governor to add more countries to the list. Proponents argue the bill is essential for protecting Texans from foreign adversaries, while critics, including Democratic representatives and Asian-American groups, denounce it as xenophobic and discriminatory. The bill now returns to the Senate for final approval before potentially heading to Governor Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff detected a suspicious meeting invitation indicating a spear-phishing attempt, leading to the precautionary reset of passwords for all users across the education service. The council has assured that students currently sitting exams will receive priority support, and no data has been compromised. This incident follows a suspected criminal ransomware cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week.</p>
