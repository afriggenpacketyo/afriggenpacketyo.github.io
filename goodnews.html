        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has agreed to cap tariffs on European Union pharmaceuticals and semiconductors at 15%, backing down from earlier threats of tariffs as high as 250%. This clarification comes as part of a broader trade agreement aimed at de-escalating economic tensions between the two major trading partners. In exchange for the U.S. tariff limits, the EU has committed to eliminating its own tariffs on all U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. However, a reduction in U.S. tariffs on European cars from 27.5% to 15% is conditional on the EU first implementing its tariff cuts through legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has suspended an earlier order that mandated the removal of all stray dogs from the streets of New Delhi, a decision that had sparked protests from animal rights activists. The new ruling directs that stray dogs should be caught, sterilized, and immunized before being released, with removal reserved only for cases of rabies or extreme aggression. The court also banned the public feeding of strays, instructing municipal bodies to establish designated feeding zones to manage the issue. This decision comes in response to a reported surge in dog bite incidents, with the court aiming to frame a nationwide policy.</p>

          <p>European stock markets showed a mixed reaction as investors processed the finalized details of the trade deal between the European Union and the United States. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks rose after confirmation that tariffs on their exports to the U.S. would be capped at 15%, avoiding a threatened 250% rate. However, automotive stocks closed lower as the deal revealed that a reduction in U.S. tariffs on European cars is conditional on the EU first lowering its own industrial duties. The agreement aims to de-escalate trade tensions but has created varied outcomes for different sectors across the European market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month, though it was slightly higher than economists' expectations. The moderation was partly driven by an easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged. Despite the slowdown, this marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the bank that also excludes energy prices, held steady at 3.4%. (not investment advice)</p>

The new ownership group has emphasized that their Sikh principles of discipline and compassion will guide their leadership at the club. This landmark development is seen as a significant moment for representation within British football, inspiring the Sikh and broader South Asian communities.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Launch Crackdown on Improper Overseas Child Benefit Claims</h2>

          <p>The UK government is set to expand a program aimed at cracking down on individuals improperly claiming child benefit while living abroad, a move it projects will save £350 million over five years. A new specialist team of over 200 investigators will use international travel data to identify claimants who have left the UK for more than the allowed eight weeks. This initiative follows a successful pilot program that stopped £17 million in incorrect payments to 2,600 people in less than a year. The government hopes the measure will also raise awareness of the rules to prevent people from continuing to claim the benefit by mistake.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology to the Indigenous town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for a shoe design that was criticized as cultural appropriation. Executives from the company traveled to the town to deliver the apology in person, admitting that its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe was inspired by traditional huarache sandals made in the community without proper collaboration. The controversy gained national attention after Mexico's president accused the brand of exploiting Indigenous culture. Adidas has pledged to work with the town in the future, and the designer also expressed his regret for not involving local artisans.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup in England is being celebrated as a transformative event, showcasing the sport's explosive growth with ticket sales already surpassing previous records. The tournament will utilize eight venues with a total capacity of 470,000, a significant increase from the 180,000 capacity in New Zealand three years ago, and the final at Twickenham Stadium has sold out. This growth reflects a strategic push by organizers and a shift in the sport's fanbase, which is younger and more female than the men's game. The event aims to capitalize on this momentum to propel women's rugby to new levels of popularity and professionalism.</p>

The announcement comes as the Trump administration has threatened India with additional tariffs of up to 50% on its goods. During a meeting in Moscow, officials from both nations vowed to boost trade, which reached a record $68.7 billion last year, and address India's trade deficit by increasing its exports of pharmaceuticals and agricultural products to Russia. This move reinforces the strategic alliance between the two countries amid challenging global political circumstances.</p>

Similarly, Honda attributed its price changes to added feature content, noting its significant U.S. manufacturing presence helps mitigate tariff impacts.

These advancements challenge the timeline of NASA's Artemis program, which aims for a crewed lunar landing around 2027 but has faced delays and budget issues. While the U.S. has a historical advantage, China's rapid technological development and consistent mission successes over the past decade suggest it could potentially beat NASA back to the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>A court in Bangkok has cleared former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of royal defamation charges, a significant legal victory that eases a major threat to his family's influential political movement. Thaksin faced up to 15 years in prison over remarks he made in a 2015 media interview, which prosecutors alleged violated Thailand's strict lese majeste law. The judges ruled that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. The acquittal is considered unusual, as such cases rarely end in a not-guilty verdict, and it comes as his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, currently serves as the country's prime minister.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that corn plants can communicate with their neighbors by releasing a volatile chemical compound called linalool when planted in high-density fields. This airborne signal prompts nearby corn plants to alter their soil microbiome, which in turn helps them better defend against pests. Researchers observed that maize plants in the inner rows of dense fields suffered less damage from herbivores than those on the edges, although their growth was also reduced. This discovery of plant-to-plant communication offers new insights into how agricultural practices could be optimized to enhance natural pest resistance and potentially improve crop yields.</p>
