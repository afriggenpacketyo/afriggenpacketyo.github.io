        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," delves into the concept of "limerence," a term for romantic obsession characterized by intense emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while this infatuation is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of addiction if a healthy bond doesn't form, leading to anxiety and craving. The article outlines strategies from the book for breaking free from unhealthy limerence, such as limiting contact with the person and reframing daydreams to focus on negative outcomes or memories to diminish the perceived reward.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old sixth grader from Oakland, California, has been recognized for his delightful podcast submission to NPR's annual Student Podcast Challenge. The student, Ryan Betts-Ng, created "Monster Madness," an episode dedicated to his favorite monster, Bigfoot, with assistance from his younger brother, Marshall. The podcast was praised by judges for its thorough research, creative writing, original sound effects, and the joyful, enthusiastic energy the brothers brought to their storytelling, making it a standout entry among thousands of submissions.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference, the party is contemplating its future strategy following significant gains in the last general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's high-profile stunts have successfully garnered media attention, but recent polling suggests many voters, including the party's own supporters, feel they make the party look less serious. The party now faces the challenge of converting its increased parliamentary presence into sustained political relevance by expanding its policy platform beyond key campaign issues and defining a clear message for voters.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly adopting AI tools like ChatGPT to automate tasks and reduce employee burnout, an issue costing U.S. businesses millions annually. While AI can lighten cognitive loads and allow for early intervention by flagging at-risk employees, it may also be part of the problem. Some studies suggest frequent AI users report higher burnout rates, as the time saved is often filled with more work, and the continuous mental engagement with AI tools can be exhausting. Effective implementation requires balancing AI's productivity benefits with the need for mental rest and recovery.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and are returning to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations brokered by the Qatari government. The Taliban, which never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention, stated the couple had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings were completed.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are heavily favored to win their Rugby World Cup semi-final against France, boasting a record 31-test winning streak and having defeated the French in their last 16 meetings. Despite the daunting statistics, France has consistently been England's toughest opponent, often closing large deficits and coming within a few points of victory. France's coaches and players are embracing their underdog status, arguing that the unpredictable nature of a World Cup semi-final match renders past results irrelevant as they aim for their first-ever final appearance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw made what is expected to be his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium, one day after announcing his retirement at the end of the season. In an emotional evening, the 37-year-old veteran was celebrated by teammates and a sell-out crowd for his storied 18-year career with the team. Although Kershaw pitched 4⅓ innings, the night culminated in the Dodgers clinching their 13th consecutive postseason berth, providing a memorable send-off for the franchise icon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a new school year begins, some parents are choosing to leave school-related WhatsApp groups due to the high volume of messages, competitive parenting, and unnecessary anxiety they can generate. While the groups can be useful for reminders and organizing, they often become forums for polarized opinions and can place the burden of school communication disproportionately on one parent. Experts advise setting personal boundaries for engagement, as these informal communication channels can sometimes create more stress and background noise than they alleviate for families.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's closely watched gubernatorial election, a contest between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. The race is being viewed as a key referendum on the Trump administration's policies, particularly federal workforce cuts that have significantly impacted the state's large number of government employees. Spanberger is campaigning against these policies, while Earle-Sears is aligning herself with the economic record of the state's popular term-limited Republican governor. (not investment advice)</p>
