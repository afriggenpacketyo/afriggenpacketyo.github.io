This strategy, however, could clash with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and end state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, maintaining trade tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, dealing a blow to a key part of his economic policies. The Manhattan-based court stated that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not provide unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Trump administration swiftly lodged an appeal to this ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will spend more than ¬£1bn to develop technology to speed up decisions on the battlefield, with a new Digital Targeting Web connecting soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. This investment is part of the government's strategic defense review, highlighting lessons from the war in Ukraine. The UK military will also establish a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee military cyber operations. The extra investment is possible because of the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>
