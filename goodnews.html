        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to significantly lower the cost of drugs for in vitro fertilization (IVF) by negotiating lower prices. President Trump stated that the per-cycle drug costs could fall by an estimated 73% after biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono agreed to provide substantial discounts on its fertility drugs. While this move is presented as a major victory for families, the overall cost reduction for a full IVF cycle remains unclear, as drug prices are only one component of the expensive procedure. This action follows a previous pledge by Trump to seek full insurance or federal coverage for IVF treatments.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed a lengthy phone call between the two leaders, which the Kremlin described as frank and informative. High-level advisors from both the U.S. and Russia are scheduled to meet next week to prepare for the summit. This diplomatic effort comes amid President Trump's growing frustration with the prolonged conflict and occurs just one day before he is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.</p>

          <p>Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has begun debating a contentious bill aimed at reintroducing a form of military service to bolster the country's armed forces. The initial proposal focuses on voluntary recruitment but includes contested plans for a mandatory component, such as a lottery system, if volunteer targets are not met. The long-term goal is to more than double the size of the Bundeswehr by 2035 in response to heightened security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius acknowledged the need for a passionate and open debate on the issue, given its societal impact and Germany's complex military history.</p>

          <p>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited six Western Balkan nations, urging them to advance reforms necessary for potential EU membership. During her stop in Serbia, she publicly called for progress on the rule of law and media freedom, addressing democratic backsliding under President Aleksandar Vucic. In contrast, she praised Montenegro as a "frontrunner" for its alignment with EU foreign policy. The tour emphasized the EU's €6 billion growth plan for the region, aiming to boost economic integration and stability, driven partly by geopolitical concerns over Russian influence in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While debt settlement can be an effective strategy for unsecured debts like credit card balances, many types of financial obligations do not qualify for this form of relief. Secured debts, such as mortgages and auto loans, are typically excluded because lenders can repossess the collateral. Government-backed debts, including federal student loans and back taxes owed to the IRS, also fall outside the scope of traditional settlement programs. Furthermore, legally mandated payments like child support, alimony, and court-ordered fines cannot be negotiated down, requiring alternative strategies like bankruptcy or specialized repayment plans for resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates for a 30-year loan have fallen to 6.27%, their lowest point in about a month, creating new opportunities for potential homebuyers. Financial experts advise prospective buyers to act strategically by getting pre-approved for a loan to strengthen their offers and demonstrate financial readiness. However, they also caution against assuming rates will continue to fall, as market conditions can change rapidly. With pent-up demand, buyers should anticipate increased competition and not expect the typical seasonal lulls in the housing market, even as the holiday season approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Survey Indicates Robust Consumer Spending for Halloween Despite Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, a new survey from PwC indicates that American consumers are planning to spend robustly on Halloween this year. Nearly 80% of respondents plan to celebrate, with an expected average spending of $289 per person, and $445 for parents with young children. The top spending categories include costumes, decorations, party supplies, and candy for trick-or-treaters. The report suggests that consumers view Halloween as a relatively low-cost holiday, making them less likely to cut back on spending. This trend aligns with broader forecasts showing resilient consumer spending heading into the critical holiday retail season.</p>
