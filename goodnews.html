          <h2>Chinese Mathematicians Crack Decades-Old Kervaire Invariant Problem</h2>

          <p>Chinese mathematicians from Fudan University Shanghai Centre for Mathematical Sciences and UCLA have successfully resolved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem, which concerns the existence of specific topological spaces. This breakthrough involved advanced computational methods and confirms the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126. The Kervaire invariant, introduced by John Milnor in 1950, is a function that assesses whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery; the problem sought to identify dimensions where this invariant is non-zero, indicating the presence of unique shapes that cannot be transformed into a sphere. The findings, outlined in a paper yet to undergo peer review, provide a definitive answer to a mathematical mystery that has puzzled experts for decades, and could be applied to further problems in the field.</p>

          <p>Amid rising prices of baby gear and the spread of vaccine misinformation, some Democrats see an opportunity to connect with parents' emotions, an area where Republicans have recently been more successful. Trump administration policies, including tariff policies and cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, are causing anxiety and anger among parents. Democrats aim to persuade voters that the Trump administration is making their lives harder, particularly on issues like measles outbreaks and vaccine approaches. However, Democrats face challenges in effectively communicating and mobilizing parents, especially given the influence of movements like "Make America Healthy Again.</p>

          <p>R&B singer The Weeknd, also known as Abel Tesfaye, is set to release his new film, ‚ÄúHurry Up Tomorrow,‚Äù which he co-wrote, produced, and stars in, and it is set to arrive in theaters on May 16. Tesfaye has announced that he will retire the Weeknd persona after his sixth studio album, also titled ‚ÄúHurry Up Tomorrow,‚Äù marking a significant shift in his artistic direction. The film, directed by Trey Edward Shults, mirrors Tesfaye's real-life experiences, including a vocal breakdown during a 2022 concert that led to a personal reckoning. The film explores themes of fame, excess, and mental breakdown, with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan co-starring.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ended a duty-free loophole that allowed packages imported from China and Hong Kong valued under $800 to avoid tariffs, a move welcomed by some small businesses squeezed by Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This loophole had enabled these companies to gain market share by evading tariffs on low-value products. However, the benefits of ending this workaround are overshadowed by Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods, which impose a rate of at least 145 percent on imports from China, offering little immediate relief to small businesses. Temu has already responded by shifting to shipping from local warehouses in the U.S., signaling a fundamental change due to the new taxes.</p>

          <p>Dartmouth College stands apart from its Ivy League peers as it avoids major funding threats and investigations from the Trump administration, largely due to its president, Sian Beilock's, approach. While other Ivies face funding cuts and scrutiny over antisemitism allegations, Dartmouth has remained relatively unscathed, in part due to Beilock's emphasis on free expression and dialogue. Beilock's critics suggest she is trying to appease conservatives, while supporters see her as a champion of open dialogue. Her actions, including a police crackdown on a pro-Palestinian demonstration and the hiring of a former Republican Party official, have further positioned Dartmouth in a favorable light with conservatives.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third consecutive year. The report focuses on tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing to manage allergy symptoms. She also advises consulting a doctor if experiencing breathing issues or prolonged symptoms, as they could indicate other underlying conditions.</p>

These rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation.
