          <p>Honda has announced it is ending the U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled by General Motors in Tennessee. Citing evolving EV market conditions and a need to align with customer demand, Honda confirmed the cancellation of all future production for the model. The company will continue producing the Honda Prologue with GM in Mexico and plans to launch a new all-electric Acura RSX in 2026, produced at its own EV hub in Ohio. GM stated the decision does not reflect on their partnership or the capabilities of the workforce.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though not dramatically. For a 10-year loan, the monthly payment is now around $989, while a 15-year term costs approximately $779 per month. The article notes that while these costs are marginally lower than earlier in the year, the difference is minimal, saving borrowers only a few dollars monthly. Homeowners are advised to carefully weigh these costs against other borrowing options like HELOCs before leveraging their home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the candies, such as peanut butter pumpkins and ghosts, lacked the detailed artistic carvings depicted on the wrappers. However, the judge ruled that consumers did not suffer economic harm, as the product was not rendered worthless by the absence of these details. The consumers' attorney stated they intend to amend and refile the complaint, arguing that companies shouldn't profit from false representations.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models can now pass all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat that typically requires humans over 1,000 hours of study. Researchers from NYU Stern and GoodFin tested 23 large language models, finding that frontier models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus could successfully answer the difficult multiple-choice and essay questions of the Level III exam. While previous AI struggled with the essay portion, the rapid evolution of the technology now allows it to handle the high-level analytical reasoning required, signaling its transformative potential for the finance industry.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, who spent 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, has been awarded a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood, California. His 2022 exoneration came after new DNA evidence not only cleared him but also identified another suspect, who has since died. A federal civil rights lawsuit demonstrated that an Inglewood police detective had falsified evidence and ignored information that corroborated Hastings' alibi. Hastings, now 72, stated that while no amount of money can restore his lost years, the settlement marks a welcome end to his decades-long ordeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved amendments to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity rule for "pattern day traders," potentially making active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this minimum balance. It will be replaced with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken, rather than a fixed equity threshold. The change, which awaits SEC approval, reflects the evolution of technology and market access for retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, India and China held separate meetings with Global South nations, signaling a continuing rivalry for leadership of the developing world. While China's Premier Li Qiang hosted a Global Development Initiative event, India led a gathering of "like-minded" countries focused on south-south cooperation and diversified supply chains. China also announced it would no longer seek special treatment as a developing nation in WTO negotiations, a key demand from the U.S. In contrast, India continued to position itself as a democratic alternative to China for developing nations.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the United States surged by 20.5% in August, reaching their highest level since early 2022 and marking the largest monthly gain in two years. This unexpected jump occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, surprising many economists. Analysts suggest the increase may be attributed to homebuilders offering significant price cuts and incentives to attract buyers. However, some experts caution that the data is volatile and prone to revision, suggesting the magnitude of the increase may be overstated, though the upward trend is directionally correct.

          <p>Beachgoers along the Texas coast have recently encountered multiple "pink meanie" jellyfish, a rare and massive species known for its vibrant color and long tentacles. Jace Tunnell of Texas A&M's Harte Research Institute reported seeing over ten of the creatures, which can weigh over 50 pounds and have tentacles reaching up to 70 feet. First identified as a distinct species in 2011, pink meanies primarily feed on smaller moon jellyfish and follow their populations in warm waters. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild.</p>

His comments follow a push from U.S. lawmakers for China to place new aircraft orders and a new partnership between Boeing and Palantir to integrate AI into its defense and space operations. Cramer and his team noted that the stock's recent 10% pullback presents a good opportunity to buy, expressing confidence in the company's long-term prospects. The discussion also touched on rising bond yields and concerns about vendor financing in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>
