          <p>A wave of younger, social-media savvy Democratic candidates are launching primary challenges against long-serving incumbents, driven by frustration with what they perceive as an ossifying and out-of-touch party establishment. These insurgents argue that party elders have failed to respond with urgency to contemporary political crises, advocating for new energy, vision, and a more aggressive fight against opposition. The article highlights examples of challengers who believe the party needs a full-scale reimagining of its values and communication strategies to reconnect with a diverse and increasingly disaffected electorate. This movement signals a deep introspection and generational friction within the Democratic party as it grapples with its future direction.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old Florida man, has achieved a lifelong ambition by receiving his high school diploma, decades after his education was severely disrupted by abuse at the infamous Dozier School for Boys. Horne, who attended the state-run reform school in the 1960s, described the physical mistreatment as "horrible," an experience that led him to drop out to support his family. He earned his diploma through a compensation program established for victims of the shuttered school, which was known for widespread abuse and numerous deaths. This article celebrates Horne's resilience and determination, offering inspiration while shedding light on a dark chapter in Florida's history and the importance of acknowledging past trauma.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tinted sunscreens provide a crucial benefit over traditional formulas by blocking visible light radiation, which significantly contributes to hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones. While standard sunscreens focus on UV protection, visible light penetrates deeper and can damage pigment cells. Dermatologists recommend seeking products containing iron oxide, the ingredient that gives tinted sunscreens their color, for effective defense against these conditions. This article underscores the importance of developing more diverse and scientifically-backed sun protection options to address varied skin concerns and improve overall skin health for all.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astrophysicist Adam Becker, author of "More Everything Forever," strongly contends that Mars colonization, often championed by tech billionaires like Elon Musk, is a "horrible idea" and a "delusion." Becker argues that Mars is an uninhabitable planet with unbreathable air, high radiation, poisoned soil, and no biosphere, making it a far worse place than even a disaster-stricken Earth. He criticizes the billionaires' vision for perpetual growth and a trillion humans in space, advocating instead for humanity to focus its efforts on preserving and improving our uniquely suitable home planet. This article highlights a significant debate on the future of humanity and the responsible use of resources.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has recommenced its eruptions, with lava soaring 100 feet into the air within its summit crater, marking the 31st such event since December. This ongoing activity, which is contained and not threatening local communities, provides spectacular viewing opportunities at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists are closely monitoring the magma flow and unique fountain eruptions, which are part of a pattern observed only a few times in the last two centuries. The article also touches on the deep cultural significance of Kilauea for Native Hawaiians, who connect its activity to the goddess Pele, blending scientific observation with ancient traditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is actively expanding its defense partnerships, notably with the United States and the United Kingdom, a move driven by perceived mixed signals from the US and increasing strategic concerns regarding China. Recent multinational exercises in the Philippine Sea, which saw British and US F-35B fighter jets operating from the Japanese destroyer-carrier JS Kaga, underscore this pivot. These nine-day drills, involving a total of eleven ships and twenty-three aircraft from multiple allied nations, aimed to demonstrate collective strength and foster tactical integration in the Indo-Pacific. Analysts interpret these developments as Japan's proactive strategy to adapt to a shifting geopolitical landscape and bolster its security architecture in the region.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street, Mohrenstraße, is slated for renaming to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße after a lengthy legal battle, despite a last-minute challenge from residents. The name "Mohrenstraße," or "Moor Street," has been criticized for its racist connotations, linked to the historical practice of enslaving Africans in Germany. The new designation will honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century African-born philosopher who was the first to earn a European doctorate and explored the legal rights of people of color on the continent. This article marks a significant step in Germany's ongoing decolonization efforts, aiming to recognize Black history and address historical injustices embedded in public spaces.</p>

          <p>Turkey is exploring new regulations to significantly reduce food waste at its popular all-you-can-eat hotel buffets, especially the traditional "Serpme Kahvalti" or mixed breakfast. Presidential advisors are developing proposals in response to reports that Turkey discards 8.7 million tons of food annually, with individuals wasting an average of 102 kilograms each year. Critics contend that these extravagant buffets often result in half the food being thrown away, leading to substantial waste of raw materials, energy, and environmental impact. The article also points to potential conflicts of interest within the tourism industry, suggesting that hotel owners benefiting from all-inclusive packages might resist reforms to this highly attractive tourist offering.</p>
