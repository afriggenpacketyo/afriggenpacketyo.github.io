          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, after he was detained for over three months. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, leading to demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The Trump administration argued that his activism interfered with US foreign policy and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him due to his protests against Israel's actions in Gaza and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son. The judge ruled that the government's justification for detaining Khalil was likely unconstitutional, prompting the administration to cite a different charge related to his residency application.</p>

          <p>Viral videos on Chinese social media have sparked debate about respect for the elderly. One video shows an elderly woman asking a young woman to give up a courtesy seat on a subway, leading to criticism from other young passengers and a refusal to move. In another incident, an elderly man with a cane asked a young man to give up his seat on a train, resulting in a heated argument. These incidents have reignited discussions about the erosion of traditional values such as filial piety in China's modern society, while staff at the subway authority in Shanghai offered little guidance on how to avoid such situations in the future.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated they denied entry to federal immigration agents at their stadium, while ICE denied being present. The Department of Homeland Security said Customs and Border Protection personnel were briefly in the parking lot for reasons unrelated to enforcement. The Dodgers announced a $1 million donation to support immigrant families affected by recent immigration enforcement operations in Southern California. The team, with a large Latino fan base, expressed solidarity with the community, as player Kik√© Hern√°ndez voiced criticism of the immigration raids. The intensified ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Trump's broader immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the topic of wearing shorts in the office remains contentious despite the increasing casualization of workplace attire. While some companies have no explicit dress codes and encourage comfortable yet professional clothing, others expect staff to dress appropriately, especially when meeting clients. Stylists suggest that the appropriateness of shorts depends on context, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than beach or sports shorts. Some companies, like We Are Social, even allow employees to wear hot pants, while others, like Santander, prohibit beachwear. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation.</p>
