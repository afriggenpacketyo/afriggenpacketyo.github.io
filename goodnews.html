        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys CEO Stephen Jones has stated that the team has moved on from the trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons, calling the matter "in our rearview mirror." The comments came after Parsons made a successful debut with the Green Bay Packers, recording a sack in their season-opening victory against the Detroit Lions. Jones emphasized that the team's focus is now on its future and winning games, deflecting questions about reports that the rival Philadelphia Eagles had made a stronger trade offer. Meanwhile, the Cowboys' defense struggled in their own opening game, particularly against the run.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a succession agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the conservative media empire, which includes Fox News and News Corp. The deal resolves a long-standing family dispute by having siblings James, Elizabeth, and Prudence cease being beneficiaries of trusts with company shares, effectively removing their influence. In exchange, they will receive cash from the sale of their holdings, ensuring the conglomerate's conservative direction continues after Rupert Murdoch's death. This resolution, which ends all related litigation, follows years of internal conflict that famously inspired the television show 'Succession'.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has returned to training with his county team Durham after recovering from a shoulder injury, signaling a positive development for his availability in the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. Stokes, who missed the final Test against India, has started batting in the nets, although his return to bowling is expected to take longer. His head coach expressed confidence that the all-rounder will be prepared for the winter tour. The update is a significant boost for England, as Stokes is considered a crucial player for their chances of winning the prestigious series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reduce pollution while simultaneously expanding its industrial base, a success attributed to a revolution in green technology and stringent environmental monitoring. Research indicates that from 2015 to 2022, the average national level of PM2.5 air pollution particles dropped by over 35%, an improvement comparable to what the U.S. achieved in three decades. This progress is not a result of deindustrialization but rather a strategy of "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." The approach involves deploying advanced technology, real-time data monitoring, and substantial investments in green infrastructure to improve air and water quality.</p>

          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen has revealed that he felt "held hostage" by his past, which motivated him to write about his sexual history and struggles with addiction in his new memoir, 'The Book of Sheen.' In recent interviews, Sheen explained that people from his past held compromising information over him, compelling him to pay for their silence. He also discussed how his addiction led to same-sex encounters and how he used alcohol to mask a stutter. Now sober for eight years, Sheen stated that publicly disclosing his HIV-positive diagnosis in 2015 was a "tremendous relief" and that he is now focused on owning his own stories.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent attendance at a major military parade in Beijing alongside other world leaders marks a significant diplomatic victory, transforming his image from an isolated pariah to an influential global figure. This event, where he was photographed with heads of state from Russia and China, represents a stark contrast to a decade ago when North Korea was diplomatically constrained. The article argues that after years of nuclear provocations yielding little engagement, Kim has successfully elevated his nation's international standing. This shift began with inter-Korean diplomacy and has now culminated in a strengthened alliance with Beijing and Moscow.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep waterway in the San Francisco Bay, providing a rare glimpse into how the animals populate the island. A breeding pair first arrived on the island nearly a decade ago, likely by swimming a mile from the mainland, and have since established a growing population of 14 to 17 related individuals. Researchers have been studying this unique colonization, which is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding their territory throughout the Bay Area. The sighting confirms that coyotes are strong swimmers capable of crossing significant bodies of water.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively preventing its demolition. This ruling rejects a legal challenge from the property's owners, who had planned to raze the house to expand their adjacent estate. The 1920s Spanish-style home is the only one Monroe ever owned herself and was where she died in 1962. The decision marks the second time the house has been saved, following a unanimous City Council vote last year, and represents a victory for preservationists and fans who consider the property an iconic piece of Hollywood history.</p>

          <p>A terminal at London's Heathrow Airport was partially evacuated and later reopened following an investigation into a possible hazardous materials incident. Emergency services, including fire crews and specialist police officers, were called to Terminal 4, where the check-in area was cleared as a precaution. After a thorough search, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that no trace of any adverse substance was found. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics at the scene, with one individual taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening conditions. The airport apologized for the disruption while working to resume normal flight operations.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to implement another interest rate cut in September, savers may question the benefits of opening a high-yield savings account. However, the article suggests these accounts remain a worthwhile option for many individuals. Rates on these accounts are still significantly higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts, and the anticipated rate cuts are expected to be gradual, minimizing the immediate impact on returns. Furthermore, they provide continued liquidity and access to funds, which is crucial in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with narrower eligibility criteria than in previous years. The new shots are officially authorized for adults aged 65 and older and for younger individuals with specific medical conditions that place them at high risk for severe illness, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart conditions. While federal officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the more limited approval may restrict access for some, particularly at pharmacies in states that require an official CDC recommendation, which is still pending.</p>
