          <h2>Denmark Lowers 2025 Economic Growth Projection Due to Pharmaceutical Sector Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 03:42:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily due to revised expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a notable fall in U.S. exports in early 2025, following a late 2024 spike, alongside increased competition in the weight loss drug market and the impact of generic medicines. Additionally, the threat of U.S. tariffs on Europe's pharmaceutical sector, despite a recent EU-U.S. trade deal, also contributed to the lowered projection. Despite this adjustment, the ministry stressed the economy's underlying strength, with high employment and inflation expected to remain below 2% annually, while revising its 2026 growth forecast upward to 2.1%.

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels will remain available on YouTube TV. This resolution follows a period of intense negotiations where YouTube, owned by Alphabet, had stated Fox was demanding significantly higher payments. A short-term extension had previously averted a potential blackout for millions of subscribers. The undisclosed financial terms of the deal prevent disruptions to major sporting events like a highly anticipated college football match and the start of the National Football League season. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr expressed satisfaction with the outcome, highlighting the positive impact for sports fans and avoiding blackouts.</p>

          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect youngsters from severe complications and reduce the estimated £24m annual loss in income and productivity due to the illness. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock emphasized empowering parents to protect their children, while experts noted the UK has lagged behind other countries like the US in offering the jab. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended this introduction in November 2023, expecting a dramatic reduction in cases.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley reflected on his US Open second-round loss to Alexander Zverev, highlighting the mind games employed by the third seed, who kept him waiting over 10 minutes. Despite the straight-sets defeat, Fearnley gained valuable experience, acknowledging Zverev's consistency and dominant serving, which ground him down over two and a half hours. The 24-year-old, just 14 months into his professional career, admitted to fluctuating performance and missed opportunities to capitalize on chances. He also recognized the need to improve his serve, having struck 12 double faults against Zverev, including on crucial points, an issue he is actively working to overcome.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of a significant acquisition, nearing a 60 million euro (£51.8m) deal for RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons. The Netherlands international is currently in England, with sources indicating he has completed his medical examination ahead of signing with Thomas Frank's side. An agreement in principle has been reached between the clubs, with the final details expected to be concluded within the next 24 hours. This potential transfer would see Simons join Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus as new summer arrivals at Spurs, following their earlier unsuccessful bids for Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze, who joined rivals Arsenal.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron co-chaired a Franco-German Ministerial Council in Toulon, marking the first such meeting since Germany's government change. Discussions centered on economic and security policy, with both leaders stressing the partnership's crucial role in Europe's future, aiming to align policies and initiatives. Simultaneously, German defense and foreign affairs ministers met counterparts in Copenhagen to bolster support for Ukraine, considering new EU measures against Russia and long-term security guarantees following recent heavy airstrikes. This comes as a survey highlights significant financial distress in Germany's healthcare sector, with three out of four hospitals reporting losses last year.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have unveiled and successfully tested an experimental vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone, whose form strikingly resembles the enigmatic "Gimbal" UFO footage declassified by the U.S. Navy in 2021. This new aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design centered around an elliptical, ring-like wing that integrates a straight central section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are mounted at the junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements. While still experimental, this design aims to significantly improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight, representing a notable advancement in aerospace technology.</p>

Verstappen, a four-time world champion, has dedicated grandstands at several races, with his home event at Zandvoort nearing its final year on the calendar after 2026. Jansen, who has been involved in F1 DJing since 2014, has witnessed the sport's commercial growth under Liberty Media, which has embraced the fan experience. Despite the popularity, Jansen notes rising ticket prices and repetitive grandstand locations are causing some fans to question repeated attendance.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, signaling a potential thaw in relations strained by past border clashes. Both nations, facing U.S. tariffs, are exploring reluctant cooperation, despite India's deep suspicion of China and a widening trade deficit. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently called for viewing each other as "partners," not "adversaries." While the summit may not resolve long-standing disputes or China's close ties with Pakistan, Modi's presence suggests a willingness to find common ground, driven by economic necessity and India's ambition to become a manufacturing hub.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an interactive tool titled "Cooler Than Me?" designed to compare local weather forecasts with those of cities across the world. This engaging feature playfully addresses Britain's national inclination to complain about the weather, inviting users to determine if their location truly experiences less sunshine or if it is, in fact, a "green and pleasant land." The tool provides a novel and accessible way for individuals to assess their forecast relative to global conditions, encouraging a broader perspective on climate. Users can access the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website, with the potential to gain insights that could make them the BBC's next star meteorologist.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is targeting aggressive growth in the international cloud computing market, fueled by increasing overseas demand for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Senior executive vice-president Dowson Tong Tao-sang, CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG), stated that overseas cloud operations have been the fastest-expanding segment, achieving high double-digit growth. Tong highlighted significant opportunities to provide Chinese open-source AI models to international clients, particularly for AI-powered applications. This sharpened focus aligns with Tencent's efforts to keep pace with rapid AI developments and intensifying competition, as markets increasingly seek to host large language models within their own regions, leveraging Tencent's expertise.

          <p>World No. 3 Coco Gauff fought through emotional distress and persistent serving woes to secure a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory against Donna Vekić in the US Open third round. Gauff experienced a public unraveling during the first set, marked by seven double faults and tears, reflecting the psychological toll of retooling her serve mid-tournament. Despite the challenges, she managed to reset during a medical timeout and displayed remarkable resilience and athleticism to close out the match. Gauff credited the presence of Simone Biles in the crowd as a source of strength and acknowledged that overcoming such a fraught experience will ultimately make her a tougher competitor in her career.</p>
