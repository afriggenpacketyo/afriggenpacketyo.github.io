          <p>Japanese stock markets, notably the Nikkei 225, experienced a surge following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend, which came after a national election defeat. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.5%, and the Topix climbed to a record high, driven by investor enthusiasm over potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, who are perceived as candidates likely to foster economic growth. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued their ascent, reflecting persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainties. Analysts anticipate a period of extended political uncertainty for Japan, yet the market's initial positive response suggests underlying optimism regarding future leadership and economic direction.

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has successfully secured approximately $100 million in a new funding round, prominently led by Alibaba Cloud, elevating its total investment to around $280 million. This substantial investment highlights the escalating global competition in the development of household robots, a sector increasingly driven by the integration of generative artificial intelligence to enhance machine interaction and autonomous task execution. X Square Robot also unveiled Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, boldly predicting the advent of "robotic butlers" within the next five years. While AI for robots currently lags behind generative AI for conversational applications, the company aims to significantly reduce hardware costs to make humanoid robots accessible to the consumer market, with plans for an initial public offering next year.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz triumphantly secured his second US Open trophy and sixth major title overall, decisively defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in a compelling four-set final. This victory marks Alcaraz's second Grand Slam win of 2025, building on his French Open triumph against Sinner earlier in the year. The 22-year-old Spaniard, who will now ascend to the world No. 1 ranking, demonstrated exceptional form throughout the tournament, remarkably dropping only one set across his seven matches. This highly anticipated showdown represented the third consecutive Grand Slam final between Alcaraz and Sinner, further solidifying their burgeoning and exciting rivalry as the sport's "New Two."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking collaborative study between China and the US, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This significant discovery challenges previous assumptions, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form a solid inner core, a characteristic once thought unique to Earth and the Moon among smaller celestial bodies. The finding could potentially reignite long-standing debates regarding whether Earth was indeed the sole planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This research provides crucial new insights into planetary formation and the internal structures of rocky planets.</p>

          <p>The US Open men's tennis final, where Carlos Alcaraz ultimately defeated Jannik Sinner, experienced delays and drew mixed reactions due to President Trump's attendance. Enhanced security measures for the presidential visit caused long lines for many ticketholders, impacting entry as the match began. Trump, observing from a luxury box, received a blend of cheers and boos, with reports suggesting broadcasters were advised to minimize crowd reactions. This appearance, the first by a sitting president at the US Open in over two decades, also sparked commentary regarding Trump's recent tariffs on Swiss products, including Rolex, a prominent tournament sponsor, highlighting the intersection of high-profile sports and political presence.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of [her] life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet, having been completely unaware of her pregnancy. This phenomenon, known as cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births, where mothers exhibit no discernible symptoms or missed periods. Robinson, who had maintained her usual work and travel routines, had attributed hip pain to a previous injury. An off-duty paramedic provided immediate assistance until an ambulance arrived, and the newborn was wrapped in a football shirt. The couple named their son Henry James in memory of a cherished club member, describing the event as a true "miracle."</p>

          <p>Margaret and Peter have successfully maintained a happy and faithful marriage for 15 years despite living in separate countries, with Margaret residing in London and Peter in Australia. This unique arrangement, often referred to as "living apart together" (LAT), has allowed Margaret to embark on a new career and establish a vibrant social life in London after their children left home, while Peter chose to remain in Australia. Although they typically see each other only once every 12 to 18 months, regular and open communication is cited as the cornerstone of their enduring relationship. While not universally suitable, this setup offers significant space and independence, enabling both partners to pursue individual interests and maintain distinct identities within their marriage.</p>

          <p>The City of Los Angeles' Recreation and Parks Commission has successfully acquired the historic Griffith Park carousel for $1 million, securing the future of this "crown jewel" of the park. Renowned for inspiring Walt Disney's vision for Disneyland, the carousel has been closed since 2022 due to ownership disputes and necessary repairs. This acquisition is an integral part of a broader restoration initiative within the park, with completion targeted before the 2028 Olympic Games. The 1926 merry-go-round, one of California's oldest wooden carousels, requires significant refurbishment but is expected to reopen under city management, thereby preserving its cherished legacy for future generations.</p>

          <p>Global investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios away from US equities and directing capital towards Asian markets, primarily driven by Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence boom and the anticipation of looser US monetary policy. Bank of America Global Research reports a shift, where after a decade of substantial inflows into US stocks, capital is now being allocated more evenly worldwide. Investors are drawn to Asia for its significant AI market potential and more attractive valuations compared to expensive US stocks. The weakening US dollar and expected Federal Reserve policy adjustments in 2025-2026 are further catalyzing inflows into Asian equities and debt funds. The global AI market is projected to quadruple by 2030, with a substantial portion deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, significant portions of Europe, and Africa were treated to the breathtaking spectacle of a "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse. This captivating celestial event occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon precisely align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an ethereal, deep red hue upon the moon's surface. The phenomenon is attributed to sunlight being refracted and scattered through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more readily than longer red ones. While people in Asia enjoyed the most complete view of the total eclipse, Europeans and Africans experienced a partial eclipse, continuing to inspire awe as it has for millennia.</p>
