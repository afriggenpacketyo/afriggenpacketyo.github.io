          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 03:11:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to team principal Christian Horner. The first error was ordering Max Verstappen to give back a position after an incident with George Russell, a decision based on perceived FIA expectations. The stewards later ruled that no penalty was warranted, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. The second error was pitting Verstappen for hard tires under a safety car, a decision Verstappen immediately questioned; Horner admitted they should have left him on soft tires. </p>

His eligibility was previously in question due to election law charges, but the ruling on the case was postponed until after the election. Eurasia Group suggests that Lee will likely pursue a more left-leaning agenda, including a potentially slower approach to tariff negotiations with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
