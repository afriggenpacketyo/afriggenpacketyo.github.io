          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has agreed to ban transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, resolving a federal Title IX investigation sparked by swimmer Lia Thomas. As part of the agreement with the Department of Education, Penn will restore records to female athletes, issue a public apology, and ensure locker rooms are separated by sex. This decision reverses the university's previous stance, which followed NCAA guidelines allowing Thomas to compete. The university acknowledged that some student-athletes were disadvantaged by the prior policies and stated the agreement closes an investigation that could have had significant consequences for the institution.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, is set to plead guilty to U.S. drug trafficking charges, according to new court filings. Prosecutors allege that he and his brother ran the "Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, which exported fentanyl to the United States and engaged in brutal torture of rivals. Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to Chicago, where he faces charges of money laundering, drug offenses, and firearm violations. This plea would make him the first of the brothers to reach a deal with prosecutors, marking a significant development in the U.S. effort against the cartel.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson has opened up about his dependence on cannabis, stating he cannot function without it and that it has been crucial to his success. In a recent interview, Tyson revealed he was under the influence of marijuana when he agreed to fight Jake Paul and used it shortly before and after the match. He is now a vocal advocate for federal marijuana reform, joining other athletes in a letter to the Trump administration. They are pushing for the rescheduling of cannabis, mass clemency for nonviolent offenders, and an end to restrictive banking practices for cannabis businesses, arguing that legalization is necessary for safety and regulation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. In a statement posted on social media, Trump said that during this period, diplomatic efforts would be made with all parties to end the war. He urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which he stated was brokered with help from Qatar and Egypt, warning that the terms would only worsen for them over time. The announcement comes as the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, continues with a rising death toll in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

Cramer noted that Microsoft's Azure cloud business overcame earlier concerns with strong growth, while Nvidia's stock rallied due to persistent demand for its unrivaled AI chips, despite initial fears of competition. He attributed Meta's success to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to quarterly earnings that significantly surpassed estimates, allowing it to recover from an earlier downturn affecting growth stocks.

          <p>China's economy has demonstrated significant resilience through the first half of 2025, navigating turbulent U.S. trade policies while maintaining steady growth toward its 5% annual GDP target. Despite this stability, experts warn of emerging pressure points in the year's second half. Analysts are forecasting a potential slowdown or contraction in export growth due to several factors, including a payback effect from front-loaded orders and an anticipated decline in U.S. consumer spending. While China has successfully diversified its trade partners to offset declines in U.S. shipments, the outlook for the remainder of the year remains an uphill climb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) since its inception in 1970, in a move aimed at boosting housing construction. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing developments in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates a key tool that opponents, from neighborhood groups to labor unions, have used to delay or block projects through lengthy environmental studies and lawsuits. While other hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, this reform marks a major shift in state policy to address its severe housing affordability crisis.</p>

While a remarkable milestone for the social media star, the WBA's decision is seen by many as reflecting Paul's immense financial drawing power more than his traditional boxing credentials.</p>
