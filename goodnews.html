          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory, offers an insightful analysis of the evolving US-China rivalry, asserting that current economic concerns, particularly US tariffs, are often exaggerated. She highlights that exports now comprise only about 19% of China's GDP, with exports to the US accounting for a mere 2.8%, making ASEAN its largest trade partner. Qian emphasizes that the competition extends beyond trade to technology and ideologies, stressing the critical need for managed accommodation to avert global harm to both nations and the world. She also underscores the vital role of women's voices in shaping effective policymaking and fostering international collaboration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that in today's multipolar world, great powers face a choice between managing hegemonic transitions through rigid alliances or opting for managed accommodation, drawing parallels to the Nixon-Zhou Enlai era. The author highlights two distinguishing factors: nuclear weapons making total war irrational and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture. Despite inherent competition, the article suggests that economic ties and the threat of mutual destruction provide powerful incentives for avoiding catastrophic confrontation. This analysis advocates for patient statecraft to navigate global shifts and ensure international stability.</p>

This unparalleled "two-way" performance, combining elite pitching and hitting, secured a World Series berth for the Dodgers. Ohtani's excellence, humility, and sportsmanship are highlighted as an inspiration in a troubled era, demonstrating the virtues of athletic and moral excellence.</p>

          <p>Millions across the US participated in "No Kings" demonstrations, protesting President Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. The peaceful rallies, larger than expected, showcased a unified front of Democrats, liberals, and anti-Trump Republicans, despite the left's limited formal power in national politics. While the White House dismissed the protests, the scale of the turnout and Trump's low approval ratings suggest a potential opportunity for Democrats to rebound from recent electoral defeats. The article explores various reasons for the protests and the challenges facing Democratic leaders amid an ongoing government shutdown and upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries visited Black churches in Los Angeles to campaign for California’s Proposition 50, a redistricting measure that could add five or six Democratic representatives to Congress. Jeffries framed the ballot initiative as a necessary response to Republican efforts to gerrymander maps and rig midterm elections, particularly amid a congressional deadlock over healthcare subsidies. California Republicans, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, criticize the measure as a "big scam" that undermines democracy by taking power from citizens. Jeffries emphasized the importance of the African American church community as a foundation for political action and truth.</p>
