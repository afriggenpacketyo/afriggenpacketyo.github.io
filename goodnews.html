          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has allowed the murder case against two men accused of killing a California State University, Northridge, official at L.A. Live to proceed, even without a known motive. Sidney Barrett Morris was fatally shot in 2023 while dining at a restaurant. Prosecutors allege that Santana Kelly orchestrated the killing and Phillip Clark was the shooter, citing surveillance footage and phone records. Defense attorneys argued for dismissal due to lack of evidence connecting their clients to Morris, but the judge found sufficient evidence to move forward with the trial. </p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rose to 3.5% in April, the highest since January 2023, driven by rising rice prices, while the Bank of Japan considers pausing rate hikes due to U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, exceeding the central bank's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda intends to raise rates but will monitor the impact of U.S. tariffs. Economist Masato Koike anticipates core inflation easing due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation, with government subsidies also applying downward pressure. </p>

The report highlights growing rates of obesity, diabetes, autism, ADHD, cancer, allergies, and autoimmune disorders in children. The report emphasizes the need for a renewed focus on improved science and private sector innovation.
