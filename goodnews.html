        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, with a fertility rate well below the level needed for population sustainability.</p>

The EP includes corridos and experimental songs blending regional Mexican sounds with alternative and rock elements, and the project was produced in collaboration with Ulises Lozano, a member of the band Kinky. Johnny created the song "72" in memory of his mother, and he acknowledges influences from both "old school" regional Mexican artists and English-language musicians like Michael Jackson and The Beatles.

The company's Android smartphones and feature phones will now adopt Google's Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead. Docomo introduced its emoji in 1999 with the i-mode service, and the set was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.

They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation, worker wellbeing, and access to funding and resources, and younger generations are less tolerant of toxic work environments.</p>
