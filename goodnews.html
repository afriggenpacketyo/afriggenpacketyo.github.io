          <p>Actor Orlando Bloom discussed the severe physical and mental toll of losing 52 pounds for his role as a boxer in the upcoming movie "The Cut." Bloom admitted to being 'hangry,' exhausted, and paranoid, describing himself as a 'horrible person' to be around during the process. He followed a grueling regimen supervised by a nutritionist, which eventually had him eating only tuna and cucumber for the final three weeks. The actor explained that while the transformation was intense and something he would not recommend, it ultimately enhanced his performance by allowing him to genuinely feel his character's struggles.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, following a reported £35 million bid from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and does not intend to sign a new one, scored in Palace's recent 3-0 victory over Aston Villa. Glasner emphasized that Guehi is a crucial player and that the club has no chance of finding a suitable replacement before the transfer window closes. The club is reluctant to lose him for free next summer but faces pressure to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Chloé Zhao has returned to intimate storytelling with her new film 'Hamnet,' which explores the marriage of William Shakespeare and the death of their son. In an interview, the Oscar-winning director of 'Nomadland' described the project as a way to process a 'very painful fire' she experienced after the critical reception of her Marvel film 'Eternals.' Zhao explained that she initially hesitated to direct a period piece about motherhood but was drawn to Maggie O’Farrell’s novel. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been met with a rapturous response at its premiere.</p>

          <p>In Kerrville, Texas, the tradition of Friday night high school football is serving as a source of community healing and normalcy following severe flash flooding in July. Residents gathered for the Tivy Antler varsity team's season opener, turning their focus to the game at the same stadium that recently functioned as a volunteer hub and memorial site. The event provided a much-needed sense of unity and recovery for a community still grappling with the aftermath of the natural disaster. The gathering demonstrates how local traditions can play a vital role in collective resilience.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have won their third straight men's Hundred title after defeating the Trent Rockets by 26 runs in the final at Lord's. Will Jacks was the star performer, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls to help his team post a competitive total of 168-5. In response, the Rockets' chase faltered, largely due to Australian leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three crucial wickets for just three runs. Despite a late charge from Marcus Stoinis, the Rockets finished short, cementing another dominant season for the Invincibles in the tournament.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge has issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit from immigrant advocates who argued the move was illegal and denied the children due process. Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's order prevents the removal of any unaccompanied minor from Guatemala who does not have a final deportation order. The government contended it was reuniting children with their families, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers.</p>

          <p>Liverpool claimed a significant early-season victory against Premier League title rivals Arsenal, winning 1-0 at Anfield. The decisive moment came in the 83rd minute when Dominik Szoboszlai scored with a magnificent 30-yard free-kick. Arsenal, under manager Mikel Arteta, adopted a cautious and conservative approach for much of the match, seemingly aiming for a draw but ultimately leaving with nothing. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 Premier League games and gives Liverpool a psychological edge in the title race, maintaining their perfect start to the season.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris described his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix as a significant blow to his world championship aspirations, but he remains committed to fighting for the title. An oil leak forced Norris out of the race, causing him to fall 34 points behind his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who won the event. Despite the frustrating setback, Norris stated that the large points gap now allows him to 'just go for it' in the remaining nine races of the season.

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from the side of his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of his post-surgery bandage and stitches on Instagram, urging his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is typically slow-growing with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. Ramsay used the personal health update to emphasize the importance of preventative measures and prompt medical attention for any skin irregularities.</p>

His previous hole-in-one came last December while playing alongside his father at the PNC Championship. The young golfer is steadily building his own list of achievements on the course, though still trailing his father's impressive record of 10 recorded aces.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion deal to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export agreement by value. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet to operate in the North Atlantic, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank. The agreement represents a major victory for the UK defense industry over international competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>
