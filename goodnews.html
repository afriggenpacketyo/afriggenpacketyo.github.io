          <p>Meta is launching a new artificial intelligence lab dedicated to the pursuit of 'superintelligence,' a move that involves reorganizing its AI efforts under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The new lab will include Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI, indicating a significant investment in talent and resources for this ambitious project. This initiative reflects the growing importance of AI in Meta's long-term strategy and its commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. The focus on superintelligence suggests Meta's interest in developing AI systems that surpass human-level intelligence in various domains, though the specific goals and timelines remain undefined.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with tariffs imposed by the United States, Chinese manufacturers are increasing exports to Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Shipments to Vietnam rose by 18.8%, Thailand by 20.9%, and Indonesia by 16.8% in the first five months of the year, compared to the same period in 2024. This shift allows Chinese manufacturers to supply factories in Southeast Asia, which then produce finished goods for local sale or export, including to the US. Analysts suggest that while some exports may be transshipped to avoid tariffs, factories often add enough local content to re-export goods as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.

The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a 'best by' date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics, as consuming too much sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the aim to sell the 2020 rice at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks earlier this year. The government hopes this measure will alleviate distribution shortages and lower overall rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a massive reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z, particularly ages 20 to 29, seeing a 47% decrease. This positive trend is attributed to wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more readily available addiction healthcare, and less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, some clusters born between 2005 and 2011 saw a slight uptick in deaths, raising concerns. Despite the progress, the Trump administration's proposed cuts to funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis could unravel this recovery.
