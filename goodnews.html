        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki, who was supported by Donald Trump. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, previously led the Institute of National Remembrance and has been critical of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. His victory could complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his agenda, as Nawrocki holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.</p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economy, the aviation industry is projected to improve in profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase from 2024, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are anticipated to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year. The IATA expects jet fuel costs to average $86 per barrel in 2025, resulting in a lower fuel bill for airlines, which is expected to benefit from the reduced fuel cost. (not investment advice)</p>
