          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, heading into the final round with a four-shot lead at 14 under par. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler played a steady, unflappable round of 67, reinforcing his reputation for converting 54-hole leads into victories. His performance has created an air of inevitability around his pursuit of the Claret Jug, which would mark his fourth major title. China's Li Haotong sits in second place and will play alongside Scheffler in the final group.</p>

          <h2>Germany Strengthens European Alliances with UK and France Amid Geopolitical Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:41:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy focus towards stronger European cooperation, particularly with France and the United Kingdom, forming a group known as the "E3." This shift, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitments to NATO. Germany recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK focused on security and arms cooperation. While aiming for more European self-reliance in defense, Merz acknowledges that these alliances supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. security guarantee for now.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to finalizing a move to Barcelona after a deal in principle was reached between the clubs. The 27-year-old, who has not played for United since being dropped by manager Ruben Amorim in December, would initially join the Spanish champions on loan with an option to buy. Barcelona's sporting director has expressed interest in Rashford, seeing him as a way to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets. The move comes as Rashford was one of five players told to train separately at United.</p>

          <p>According to a regulatory filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company on Friday, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows another significant divestment earlier in the week, as Huang capitalizes on the company's surging stock value, which has made Nvidia the world's most valuable company. The demand for its AI-powering chips continues to drive its market capitalization to new heights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open Championship after both were warned during their third rounds. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes behind schedule on Saturday after first-round groups took nearly an hour over their allotted time. DeChambeau, who called the pace of play in the first two rounds "out of control," advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness, arguing the current approach is ineffective.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines the efforts of Generation Life, a faith-based group of young activists promoting chastity until marriage to their Gen Z peers. The article follows the group's outreach on the Jersey Shore, a setting synonymous with hedonism, highlighting the challenge of their message in a secularizing and sexually open era. The activists frame chastity not just as abstinence but as a countercultural stance against the superficiality of social media and hookup culture. Their approach attempts to resonate with Gen Z's noted risk aversion and concerns about mental health and authentic connection.</p>
