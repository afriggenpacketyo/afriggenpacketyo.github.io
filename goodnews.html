          <p>President Trump revealed plans for a comprehensive missile defense shield, drawing parallels to Reagan's "Star Wars" program, with Gen. Michael Guetlein leading the project. The system aims to protect against threats from North Korea and elsewhere, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Trump's push for the shield gained momentum after watching Israel's Iron Dome during Iranian attacks, despite military officials initially expressing no need for such a system. Critics question the necessity for the U.S., buffered by oceans and friendly neighbors, while others worry about the program's potential impact on funding for other vital defense initiatives. The scale of the project, whether to protect all U.S. territory or just major cities, remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has indicated he intends to scale back his political donations after significantly supporting Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Musk stated he plans to do 'a lot less' spending in the future, though he would consider it if he saw a reason. This comes after Musk's backed candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court was defeated, despite significant financial support. Musk's increased political involvement had raised concerns about conflicts of interest, given his companies' contracts with the federal government. He also defended the performance of Doge, the White House effort to cut federal spending that he leads, despite criticism of its impact.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Opera will premiere Sarah Kirkland Snider‚Äôs ‚ÄúHildegard,‚Äù about the Medieval mystic Hildegard of Bingen. UCLA presented the West Coast premiere of Tod Machover‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchoenberg in Hollywood‚Äù at the Nimoy Theater. The opera begins and ends with Thalberg as a framing device. The 90-minute opera is basically a phantasmagoria of how Schoenberg got here. Machover's opera explores Arnold Schoenberg's integration into Los Angeles culture after fleeing Nazi Germany. The opera features flashbacks of Schoenberg's life, his meeting with MGM producer Irving Thalberg, and his interactions with figures like Shirley Temple and George Gershwin. The production uses film accompaniment and a complex score to evoke Schoenberg's spiritual progress and reinvention.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, who was the largest presidential campaign donor in 2024, has announced plans to reduce his political spending, stating, 'I think I've done enough.' Musk's decision comes after facing blowback within the Trump administration, where he played a key role in the White House, particularly with the U.S. DOGE Service, an initiative focused on cutting federal spending. However, the DOGE effort has faced scrutiny, with questions raised about its effectiveness and public polling showing disapproval. Musk's commitment to Tesla, his primary source of wealth, follows reports that the company's board may consider replacing him as CEO. Musk will still attend a dinner with Trump, signaling his continued presence in Trump's inner circle.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government's recent trade deals with the European Union and the United States, highlighting the political concessions required to secure them. While the deals demonstrate negotiating agility, they also reflect Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. The agreement with the EU allows British travelers to use electronic gates, while the U.S. deal reduces tariffs on British luxury cars. However, Britain had to make concessions, such as allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products. These trade-offs reflect Britain's reality as a midsize economy operating among larger trading blocs.</p>

          <p>Member states of the World Health Organization have overwhelmingly voted to adopt the first-ever pandemic agreement, aiming to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics. The treaty lacks enforcement mechanisms and robust funding, and the U.S. is not part of it due to President Trump's planned withdrawal from the WHO. The agreement lays out a framework for preventing pandemics, boosting surveillance of animals, and responding more effectively once pandemics occur. Countries must decide how wealthy countries will share resources with lower-income countries in exchange for data. Despite uncertainties, many health officials praised the agreement.</p>

The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) gathers biometric data on citizens arriving in the EU from non-member countries.
