        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who ate a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables were less likely to report symptoms of depression. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in the diet, may play a role in supporting mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation. Further research is needed to confirm the findings for public health applications.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans six weeks ago. The 33-year-old was arrested peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 jailbreak, described by the governor as the worst in recent state history, involved the inmates breaking through a faulty cell door and a wall. Officials have since arrested at least 16 people accused of aiding the escapees, and a $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final fugitive's capture.</p>

The majority of the donation, approximately 9.43 million shares, went to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with the remainder distributed among four charities led by his children. This recent donation brings Buffett's total giving to over $60 billion since he began the process in 2006.

          <p>The Japanese fruit sandwich, or "furutsu sando," has made its mainstream debut in the United Kingdom, with retailer M&S launching a strawberries and cream version. This snack, popular in Japan and recently viral on social media, typically features fruit and whipped cream between slices of soft, sweetened bread. While seemingly unusual to some Western palates, the concept builds on a tradition of sweet sandwiches, like banana or jam. The article explores the cultural context of the fruit sando and highlights other unique sandwiches from around the world, questioning the conventional definition of what constitutes a sandwich.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the creators and stars of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," have discussed the inspirations behind their show's second season. The dark comedy follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships. Sadler, the writer, says the new season is even more intense, influenced by their upbringing in an all-woman household and the "bleak" modern dating scene she observes online. The series is known for its unflinching and humorous take on taboo subjects like mental health and abortion, which the creators feel they can push further following their initial success.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent explored the resurgent field of phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses to kill bacteria. By collecting samples from his home, including his toilet, he successfully isolated a bacteriophage capable of killing a patient's persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. Scientists at the University of Southampton explained that while antibiotics eclipsed phage research for decades, the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs is renewing interest in this alternative. Although challenges remain in bringing phage therapy to mainstream medicine, it is available in the UK on compassionate grounds and offers a promising avenue for treating incurable infections.</p>

Using a unique P-band radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate thick foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. These initial images are revealing previously hidden features, from wetlands to areas of deforestation, giving scientists a powerful new tool to understand these vital ecosystems. The ultimate goal of the 20-year project is to create a global 3D map of forests to accurately quantify their role in mitigating climate change.</p>

The gesture was met with surprise and admiration from the students, many of whom expressed regret for not having made more of an effort to connect with her.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order unconstitutional, stating it violated the firm's First and Fifth Amendment rights. The executive orders have sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. The ruling was hailed by the firm as a victory for the rule of law and the right to legal representation without fear of retaliation.</p>

The set served as a greatest hits tour, featuring fan favorites like "Chocolate" and "If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)," alongside his characteristically verbose and self-deprecating banter.

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically on the third day, losing all ten of their second-innings wickets in the final session. Chasing a target of 301, the hosts crumbled from a promising 47-1 to 56-5 during a devastating spell from Hazlewood. Despite some late resistance, Australia sealed the win with two days to spare, demonstrating their clinical approach to closing out the match.</p>

          <h2>California More Than Doubles Tax Credit to Keep Film and TV Production in State</h2>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total from $330 million to $750 million. The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and workers have warned that California was losing thousands of jobs and at risk of decline. The expanded tax credit is aimed at making the state more competitive and bringing production back home to Hollywood. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock currently underperforming, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to lose faith in the company. He acknowledged significant challenges, including the impact of U.S.-China tariffs on manufacturing and a recent developers' conference that lacked major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. However, Cramer expressed confidence in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and pointed to the stock's historical performance, where periods of downturn have proven to be excellent buying opportunities. He suggests the stock becomes particularly attractive if its price falls to around 25 times its earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria used his Paris Fashion Week show to make a powerful statement about the treatment of immigrants and deportees. The show opened with models dressed in all-white, their hands tied, in a formation that evoked images of prisoners in high-security facilities in El Salvador used to detain some migrants deported from the U.S. Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance was intended to address the "dehumanization of how immigrants are being treated." The bold presentation was largely praised online as a revolutionary use of fashion for political commentary.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to conduct atmospheric research as part of the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). The aircraft will perform maneuvers such as vertical spirals over urban areas, landfills, and power plants to sample gasses and measure surfaces. NASA is advising the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, which will be visible over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley.</p>
