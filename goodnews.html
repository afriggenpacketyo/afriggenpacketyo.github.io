          <p>The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to use its small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy-intensive artificial intelligence data centers could make it the most valuable firm in the UK. Since his takeover in January 2023, the company's share price has increased tenfold, driven by a rebound in its core aircraft engine business and new strategic directions. Despite the SMR technology being currently unproven on a commercial scale, the company has already secured deals with the UK and Czech governments and aims to dominate a market potentially worth over a trillion dollars.

          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive cases. This policy change is intended to improve transparency and combat misinformation that can arise from a lack of official information, which in the past has fueled public unrest. The move follows several contentious cases, including one involving the alleged sexual assault of a child, where speculation about the suspects' backgrounds spread online. While the Home Office supports the measure for enhancing public trust, some critics, including a former police superintendent, warn of potential unintended consequences.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Dubai's surging property market, a growing number of major real estate developers, including Emaar Properties, are establishing their own in-house contracting firms. This strategic shift aims to gain greater control over construction timelines, costs, and quality, thereby maximizing profits in a competitive environment. Previously reliant on third-party contractors, developers now face a shortage of bidders for new projects as demand skyrockets. While this vertical integration allows for faster project completion and cash flow, some industry experts caution that it could lead to split focus and leave developers with idle capacity during a market downturn.

          <p>While most real-world AI and chatbots are programmed to be cheerful and confident, new research is exploring the potential benefits of creating robots with more neurotic or anxious personalities. Science fiction often features relatable, anxious androids like C-3PO, and researchers are now investigating whether such temperaments could make human-robot interactions more effective or comfortable in certain contexts. This field of study delves into how different AI personalities are perceived by humans and what traits might make them more approachable or trustworthy. The experiments challenge the current industry standard of universally extroverted AI assistants by testing alternative, more complex character models.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis explores the evolving economic landscape of London, noting significant challenges such as a high cost of living, persistent inflation, and the lingering economic effects of Brexit. The article highlights that London's reputation as a premier global financial center is under question, with fundraising from IPOs falling to a 30-year low. However, it also points to potential for revival through lower interest rates, new non-EU trade deals, and policy reforms aimed at fostering business growth. Former Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins emphasizes the need to improve access to capital for start-ups and leverage the UK's strengths in technology and creative industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first direct air shipment of fresh Cambodian durians has arrived in China, marking a new phase in the agricultural trade relationship between the two nations. A two-tonne shipment was transported via a cold chain logistics corridor, reaching China's Henan province in just four hours. Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the Chinese market, a development celebrated as part of China's "durian diplomacy." Cambodia produces over 120,000 tonnes of durian annually, and this new air bridge is expected to significantly boost its agricultural exports and economic ties with Beijing.</p>

          <p>In a major collaboration with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the "Los Cuinis" group allied with the CJNG cartel, and Servando "La Tuta" Gómez Martinez, former head of the Knights Templar cartel. This action represents a significant step in the U.S. Justice Department's efforts to dismantle drug trafficking networks. The transfer follows a similar extradition of 29 cartel figures in February and comes amid ongoing pressure from the U.S. on Mexico to curb the flow of illegal drugs.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made a surprise and unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. In a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Perplexity argued that moving the world's most popular browser to an independent operator would benefit user safety and the open web. However, industry investors have labeled the offer a "stunt," noting the bid is far below Chrome's estimated value and that it is not clear if Google is even considering a sale. The move comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny, with a federal judge expected to rule soon on a case that could potentially order a breakup of its business.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of science research grants to UCLA that were abruptly frozen late last month. The suspension, affecting over a third of awards totaling $584 million, was deemed by U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin to be a violation of her previous ruling that blocked such terminations. The administration had justified the cuts by citing UCLA's alleged failure to maintain a research environment free of antisemitism. This ruling marks a significant victory for UC researchers in their legal battle against what they argue are politically motivated funding cuts targeting diversity-related programs.</p>
