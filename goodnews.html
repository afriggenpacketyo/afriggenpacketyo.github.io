          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, former Labour deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has stated that the party's next deputy must be a woman from outside of London. This call comes as Labour's National Executive Committee prepares to set the rules for a leadership contest, which is seen as a pivotal moment for the party's future direction. Potential candidates like Dame Emily Thornberry are considering running, while others, such as new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, have ruled themselves out. The contest aims to quickly fill the void left by Rayner, who was a popular figure among the party's grassroots members.</p>

Before departing, he spent time signing autographs on hats for a group of his supporters. Trump was seated in a corporate suite and received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the larger crowd when he was shown on the stadium's cameras. This marked his first visit to the Grand Slam tennis tournament since before he became president, with his last known attendance being in September 2015 during his initial campaign.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, beginning November 21, has not yet been finalized. A key position under consideration is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and rising star Jacob Bethell. The 21-year-old Bethell recently scored his first professional century and is seen as having a significant future in international cricket. McCullum emphasized that the selection process is ongoing and the final decision on the playing eleven will be made closer to the match in Australia.</p>

          <h2>Labor Economists Suggest Economic Uncertainty, Not AI, is the Primary Driver of Recent Job Market Slowdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists argue that its overall impact on the job market remains relatively small compared to the effects of broader economic uncertainty. Experts point out that the recent slowdown in hiring and decline in job opportunities are more attributable to businesses acting conservatively in a volatile economic climate. Although some AI-related layoffs have occurred, particularly in the tech sector, they do not represent a widespread threat to the job market at this time. Instead, there is a growing demand for workers with AI skills, suggesting augmentation rather than replacement of human labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy, driven by the power demands of AI and data centers, is attracting significant investment, with projections reaching $2.2 trillion by 2025. However, the sector faces considerable challenges, including vast capital requirements, long construction times, and an uncertain political and regulatory landscape. While the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) offers a more scalable solution, they have yet to reach commercial viability. Experts at the World Nuclear Association symposium highlighted that government support and public-private partnerships will be crucial to overcoming these financial hurdles and realizing the potential of the nuclear renaissance.

After a slowdown in dealmaking, private equity recruitment has accelerated in 2025, with firms investing heavily to secure capital for future opportunities. Large, multi-strategy firms are reportedly 'overpaying' for talent, creating a bifurcated market where smaller firms struggle to compete. This has led to increased tension with Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are implementing stricter rules to prevent their analysts from being poached.
