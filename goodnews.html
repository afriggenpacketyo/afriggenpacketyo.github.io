          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, emphasizing his foreign policy's focus on peacemaking and partnerships, even with countries holding profound differences. Donning a "Make America Great Again" cap, Trump criticized past political leaders for misusing the military in unintended missions, asserting his commitment to core national interests. He lauded the cadets' choice to serve in the military as a superior path compared to high-paying careers in the business world, highlighting the values of honor and sacrifice. Trump's address underscored his "Golden Age" agenda and his view of himself as a "peacemaker" amidst ongoing global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jefferson's Monticello is launching a new tour, "Founding Friends, Founding Foes," to explore the complex relationship between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, using their lifelong frenemyship to reflect on today's toxic politics and hyperpolarization. The tour unpacks their often-fractious relationship, from collaborating on the Declaration of Independence to Jefferson's defeat of Adams in the 1800 presidential election, and invites guests to consider parallels with contemporary political divisions. By delving into the messy origins of partisan politics, Monticello aims to foster civic connection and inspire visitors to disagree better, in an effort to save the teetering edifice of American democracy.</p>

          <h2>American Men Struggle with Deep Friendships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 05:00:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essayist reflects on the decline of deep male friendships in America, noting that men are increasingly isolated and struggle to connect with one another on an emotional level. The author shares personal anecdotes and cites studies showing a significant decrease in the number of close friends men have, attributing this trend to societal expectations around masculinity, a fear of vulnerability, and the prioritization of romantic relationships and families. While acknowledging the challenges, the author explores potential solutions, such as embracing self-improvement and seeking inspiration from historical examples of male intimacy, and emphasizes the importance of making an effort to nurture and maintain friendships, even in the face of societal pressures and personal anxieties.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News poll reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's dismissal over a controversial remark about receiving gifted rice. The survey also indicated that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a lower target than pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, while the approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet saw a slight increase. These findings reflect public sentiment regarding rice prices and the government's handling of agricultural issues in Japan (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Expert Urges Calm Over West Nile Virus Detection in UK Mosquitoes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 03:20:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A virologist is urging calm after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, stating that mosquito-borne diseases are "likely" to increase in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus, which can sometimes cause serious illness in humans, were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, and authorities will increase surveillance on land along the River Idle. While there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date, the public is advised to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide, as the expert emphasizes awareness rather than undue concern.</p>
