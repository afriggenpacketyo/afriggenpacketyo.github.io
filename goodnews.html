          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has secured $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a fintech app tailored for immigrant communities in the U.K. The app supports collaborative saving methods, such as "money circles," addressing the lack of understanding from mainstream banks regarding immigrant financial practices. Bloom Money aims to provide a regulated digital platform for these traditional savings methods, which often face issues like lack of regulation and suspicion from mainstream banks. The app allows users to create savings circles, invite participants, and manage funds collectively, reducing the risk of fraud and promoting financial inclusion for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri argues against proposed Medicaid cuts in the upcoming Republican bill, emphasizing the program's importance to working-class Americans. Hawley points out that Medicaid serves over 70 million Americans, including many in his state, and that Missouri voters mandated Medicaid expansion in 2020. He contends that cutting Medicaid would harm working families, lead to hospital closures, and contradict President Trump's promise to protect social insurance programs. Hawley urges Republicans to focus on policies that support working families, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts, rather than eliminating healthcare.</p>

          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar encourages the Democratic Party not to dismiss female presidential candidates after Kamala Harris's defeat, citing successful female leaders in other countries and U.S. states. Klobuchar's comments respond to Joe Biden's remarks attributing Harris's loss to sexism, as Klobuchar argues that other Democratic women have won key Senate races. She suggests the party would have benefited from a more competitive primary and focuses on helping Americans rather than dwelling on past election outcomes. Klobuchar does not rule out a future presidential run herself, stating her current focus is on her Senate duties.</p>

          <p>The article argues that a thriving American Dream depends on robust public services like schools, hospitals, and fire departments, rather than solely on tax cuts and slogans. It highlights the importance of these services in supporting working families and local economies, using the author's mother, a NICU nurse, as an example of a public servant contributing to the community. The piece criticizes proposed federal budget cuts to public K-12 schools and emphasizes that a strong workforce requires investment in education and training. It concludes that prosperity relies on investing in people and places, ensuring access to essential services and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The article explores how to transform refined carbohydrates like white rice and pasta into healthier options by increasing their resistant starch content. Cooking and then chilling these foods converts digestible starches into resistant starches, which act like fiber and offer various health benefits, including improved gut health and better blood sugar management. This process reduces the rapid rise in blood sugar typically associated with these foods, making them more beneficial for people with diabetes. The article provides practical tips on incorporating chilled leftovers into meals and emphasizes the importance of gently reheating to preserve the resistant starch.</p>

          <p>Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has directed the group to lay down arms and disband after a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. This move follows Ocalan's historic call in February for his fighters to end their armed struggle, signaling a major step towards resolving the conflict. Ocalan, who has been in solitary confinement since 1999, has recently been visited by lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish opposition DEM party, indicating a potential shift in attitudes towards the Kurdish issue. While many Turks view Ocalan as an enemy, his influence remains significant among Kurds, potentially paving the way for a more peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>The PKK, an outlawed Kurdish group that has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. The move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the organization to dissolve itself, citing the pursuit of Kurdish rights through democratic politics. While the implications of this decision remain unclear, it is speculated that Ocalan may be paroled, and Kurdish politicians are hoping for a new political dialogue leading to greater Kurdish rights. This decision is seen as an important step towards a "terror-free Turkey," but requires a major democratic transition by Turkey to accommodate Kurdish demands.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group that has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades, announced on Monday that it would lay down its arms and disband. The announcement came a few months after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, urged the group to disarm and disband, saying the group‚Äôs armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The PKK began as a secessionist group that sought to create an independent state for Turkey‚Äôs Kurdish minority, but more recently, it has said that it sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to significantly reduce tariffs in the next 90 days, according to top US officials. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that both sides will reduce their tariffs by 115%. The move comes after President Donald Trump signaled that trade talks with Beijing were going well over the weekend. Beijing has also announced "substantial progress" in trade talks with Washington. The announcement has seen the US dollar, which has dipped significantly since Trump began his second term in January, rebound somewhat against the yen and the euro.</p>

McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow multiple times and is familiar with the course's layout and conditions. The course will be set up tougher than usual, but McIlroy's confidence and positive memories at the venue make him a strong contender. A victory would move McIlroy alongside Sir Nick Faldo's six majors and tie the record for any European in the modern era.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) suggests that shipping companies will need to adapt to trade barriers and higher port fees resulting from the global trade war. Guy Platten, secretary-general of the ICS, emphasizes the industry's resilience and ability to adjust to market changes due to the mobility of ships. He expresses hope for common sense to prevail and for free trade to increase prosperity, as the US imposes tariffs and fees targeting Chinese vessels. The US Trade Representative announced fees that will take effect in mid-October, aiming to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security.</p>
