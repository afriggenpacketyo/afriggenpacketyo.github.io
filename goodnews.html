          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, despite criticism and uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs. Powell characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market as near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. He indicated that policymakers are prepared to maintain their current stance until the effects of tariffs on prices become clearer. Powell's cautious approach could further provoke President Trump, who has publicly criticized the Fed's handling of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The payout from a $400,000 immediate annuity purchased at age 70 varies based on gender, with men receiving around $2,923 per month and women around $2,763 due to differing life expectancies. Joint life annuities, which continue payments to a surviving spouse, offer lower monthly checks of approximately $2,449. Annuity payouts are influenced by interest rates, with higher rates translating to stronger payouts, and the type of annuity chosen, such as fixed, inflation-adjusted, or variable. To maximize monthly income, opting for a single-life annuity and skipping optional riders are recommended, but one should consider the lack of access to the lump sum and changing circumstances before purchasing.

          <p>After submitting 646 job applications, a Swansea University graduate finally landed a trainee accountant position. Caitlin Morgan faced 18 months of job hunting and numerous rejections, leading her to question the value of her university degree. Research indicates that competition for graduate roles is at a record high, with an average of 140 applications per job. Morgan believes that artificial intelligence used in resume screening may have contributed to her initial difficulties, as her CV needed adjustments to be properly read by applicant tracking systems.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Russia's President Putin only understands the language of force and committed Germany to paying its "fair share" to defend Europe. Merz's statements were made hours before the NATO summit in The Hague, where leaders are expected to commit to spending 3.5% of national output on defense and 1.5% on related infrastructure. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged European colleagues to stop worrying about the U.S. commitment and focus on investing in defense and supporting Ukraine. NATO member states are expected to approve a major new investment plan to raise the benchmark for defense investment to 5% of GDP.</p>

          <p>With rising natural gas prices expected to make air conditioning more expensive this summer, experts offer several tips to save on cooling costs. These include sealing windows and doors to prevent air leaks, using fans to reduce thermostat temperatures, managing sunlight with blinds, and using heat-producing appliances wisely. Regular maintenance of AC systems, such as changing filters, is also crucial for optimal performance.

          <p>California's groundwater supplies received a significant boost due to average precipitation in the past year. Aquifers gained an estimated 2.2 million acre-feet of groundwater, aided by managed aquifer recharge projects. While replenishment efforts are underway, groundwater pumping for agriculture continues to draw on underground supplies. The state is implementing water-saving programs and regulations to curb overpumping in farming areas, though infrastructure challenges remain.</p>
