          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a leading AI expert, states that the future impact of generative AI on jobs and the economy is largely unknown, even among top research labs. He highlights that no worker currently possesses five years of experience with gen AI, emphasizing a significant knowledge gap in the workforce. Mollick advocates for a cultural shift in leadership and education, moving from rewarding definitive answers to valuing brilliant questions, information editing, and rapid decision-making. He stresses the importance of continuous learning, adaptability, and soft skills like empathy and curiosity in an AI-driven world. Mollick advises leaders to personally engage with AI tools for at least 10 hours weekly to discover practical applications.</p>

          <p>The relics of St. Francis of Assisi, one of history's most revered saints, will be publicly displayed in Italy from February 22 to March 22, 2026, marking an extraordinary event nearly 800 years after his death. His body will be moved from its crypt to the papal altar in the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. Vatican News reported this rare veneration, which is expected to draw a large influx of pilgrims and tourists requiring online reservations. The Franciscan community views this exposition as a profound invitation to prayer and reflection on the saint's enduring legacy of peace, fraternity, service, and care for creation.</p>

          <p>Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted to their lowest level in over half a century, according to federal data. During the first eight months of the Trump administration, fewer than 9,000 illegal crossings were recorded monthly, a stark contrast to the previous administration. This significant reduction, the lowest since 1970, is attributed to President Trump's immigration executive orders, including troop deployments, ending asylum requests, and expanding ICE's powers. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson stated these figures demonstrate progress on border security, making Americans safer from unvetted individuals and dangerous drugs.</p>

Huang envisions a world relying on the American tech stack, including products from Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, similar to the global reliance on the U.S. dollar. The article notes Nvidia's agreement to share a percentage of China sales revenue with the U.S. government for export licenses, and Huang's warning that a complete ban on chip exports to China would harm American firms.

He criticizes the unsustainable practice of valuing companies with modest revenues at billions of dollars, noting the immense financial returns required to justify such figures. However, Bravo highlights a key difference from the dot-com bust: large companies with healthy balance sheets are now financing AI businesses. Despite inflated early-stage valuations, he believes this corporate backing provides a different dynamic, suggesting a more resilient, albeit still speculative, market environment.

          <p>Drugmakers are increasingly shifting to direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales models, often leveraging telehealth platforms, a trend encouraged by the Trump administration's efforts to lower U.S. drug prices. Amgen recently joined this movement, offering its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha at a 60% cash discount. This follows similar initiatives from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Novartis, many of whom are offering significant discounts by bypassing traditional middlemen. The administration aims to tie U.S. drug prices to lower international rates and launched TrumpRx.gov for discounted direct purchases. This article highlights the industry's response to political pressure and the potential for increased patient access and affordability, despite ongoing debates over healthcare costs.

          <p>Despite the ongoing government shutdown, the S&P 500 has shown resilience, with historical data indicating that market gains during and after shutdowns are not uncommon. The index returned 0.80% in the first week of the current shutdown and achieved new highs. Historically, the S&P 500 spiked 36% in the year following the 2019 shutdown and 19.7% after the 1982 shutdown. Experts suggest that markets are forward-looking and tend to price in future conditions rather than immediate political "noise." The article advises investors to temper reactions and remain invested, emphasizing that broad market exposure often outperforms reactive trading during periods of political gridlock.
