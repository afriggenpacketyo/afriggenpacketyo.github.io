          <p>At a beer festival in eastern China, two performers captured widespread attention online with an "electric dance" utilizing large Tesla coils. Video of the event shows the performers, clad in insulated protective gear, standing between the coils as arcs of electricity pass around and through them, creating a visually stunning but concerning spectacle. The performance has generated a mix of wonder and alarm on social media, with many users expressing amazement at the display while others raised serious questions about the safety of the stunt. The article highlights the unique and risky nature of the performance.</p>

          <p>The flirtatious and hands-on behavior between "Fantastic Four" co-stars Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby has sparked romance rumors and successfully generated significant hype for their upcoming film. Public relations experts suggest that such tactics are often a deliberate strategy to build buzz for a movie, creating a narrative that draws public interest. While Pascal has stated that physical touch is a coping mechanism for his anxiety, and Kirby has defended their interactions as innocent, analysts note the undeniable benefit to the studio. The online commentary surrounding the actors effectively serves as free promotion for the film.</p>

          <h2>China Pledges to Reinforce Oversight in Key Manufacturing Sectors like EVs and Solar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:54:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to tighten oversight in key manufacturing industries, including electric vehicles and solar power, to combat excessive competition. The ministry intends to phase out outdated production capacity and use upgraded standards to address the issue of 'neijuan,' or intense internal competition, that has become prevalent. This move is part of a broader government effort to stabilize key industrial sectors and regulate what it terms low-quality, cut-price competition. The goal is to promote healthier development and support high-tech consumer goods to boost domestic demand.</p>

          <p>South Korean tech giant Samsung has invested in AI chip startup Rebellions, which is currently raising between $150 million and $200 million in a new funding round. Rebellions, formed from a merger with rival Sapeon, is positioning itself as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia, focusing on AI inferencing chips. The startup, which has previously raised $220 million from investors like SK Hynix and Aramco, plans to pursue an initial public offering after this funding round.

          <p>Google is rolling out a new optional "AI Mode" for its search engine in the UK, representing a significant change to how users can receive information. Instead of a traditional list of links, this mode will provide conversational, AI-generated answers with fewer direct links to external websites. The move has raised concerns among publishers and businesses who rely on Google search traffic for revenue, as it could reduce click-through rates. Google states the tool, powered by its Gemini AI, is designed to handle more complex, natural language queries from users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States could unexpectedly benefit the United Kingdom, according to some economic analysts. With the EU facing a 15% tariff on goods imported to the U.S., the U.K.'s lower 10% levy makes its exports relatively cheaper and more attractive. This tariff difference could incentivize U.S. firms to source more goods from Britain and may even encourage EU-based manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to maintain their profit margins. However, experts note that any potential benefits will likely take time to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant shift in global manufacturing, India has overtaken China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, with shipment volumes soaring by 240%. This change is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade tensions. In contrast, China's share of smartphone exports to the U.S. fell from 61% to just 25% during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid the modern craze for collectible toys like Labubu, this article explores the history of a nostalgic predecessor: the Monchhichi. While the Japanese-designed monkey doll became a global sensation in the 1980s, it was unavailable in communist East Germany due to a ban on capitalist imports. In response, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg created its own version called the Tiemi. The Tiemi became highly popular throughout the Eastern Bloc but ceased production after German reunification, making the surviving dolls sought-after collector's items today, embodying a unique piece of Cold War-era culture.</p>

The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, where income rose 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion due to increased market volatility and trading income. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from a turbulent quarter in global markets that boosted trading revenues. CEO C.S.
