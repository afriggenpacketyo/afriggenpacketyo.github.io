          <p>Pete DeJoy, the interim CEO of tech startup Astronomer, has issued his first public statement after his predecessor resigned over a viral video.

The scandal generated over $7 million in bets on prediction markets regarding his ouster. DeJoy acknowledged the 'unusual and surreal' media attention, expressing a commitment to move the company forward and focus on its mission in the data and AI sector.</p>

          <h2>Shark Attack Survivor Offers Safety Advice for Ocean Encounters</h2>

          <p>Amid recent shark sightings on the U.S. East Coast, a survivor is sharing safety tips for beachgoers. Paul de Gelder, who lost a hand and leg in a 2009 shark attack, advises people to remain calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract sharks who are often just curious. He recommends maintaining eye contact with the shark, as they prefer an easy, unseen target, and only as a last resort, pushing the shark away by its nose. De Gelder is featured in a new Discovery Channel special where he demonstrates these survival techniques to educate the public.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced it will introduce Pepsi Prebiotic Cola this fall, entering the growing market for functional, gut-health-focused beverages. The move comes just months after the company's $1.95 billion acquisition of the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi. The new drink will contain three grams of prebiotic fiber and five grams of cane sugar, differing from classic Pepsi which uses corn syrup. This launch reflects PepsiCo's strategy to innovate within health trends as traditional soda consumption declines, aiming to attract new customers and boost its North American beverage volume.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a sign of hope and growing political power for Muslim and South Asian communities. Grassroots organizations representing working-class immigrants were crucial to his campaign, which focused on affordability and Palestinian rights. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen by many as a challenge to long-held assumptions about who can represent a major American city, particularly in a post-9/11 landscape. His success reflects a broader shift in the priorities of many Democratic voters, resonating with a diverse coalition across the country.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, a company that rents out artificial intelligence data centers, saw its stock climb over 5% after announcing plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds. The company stated the capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including paying down existing debt. This follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was heavily oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion data center project in Pennsylvania. CoreWeave, which counts Nvidia and Microsoft as major clients, has seen its share price more than triple since its public debut. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 per year, many students rely on federal loans, which come with specific borrowing limits. These limits vary based on dependency status and year in school; for instance, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while a graduate student can borrow up to $20,500. The aggregate lifetime limit for undergraduates is $31,000 for dependents and $57,500 for independents. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to supplement with private loans, which can offer competitive rates but typically require a credit check.

CEO Russell Weiner noted that Domino's grew sales across all income levels, including low-income customers, a trend that bucks the struggles seen by other fast-food chains. While confident in its value strategy, the company's earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its investment in China. (not investment advice)</p>

Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the state senate, secured the party's endorsement after Frey's supporters questioned the electronic voting process and left the convention. The win gives Fateh momentum in the mayoral race, drawing parallels to Zohran Mamdani's recent primary victory in New York City.

The deal with Barcelona includes an option to buy for a set fee of €35 million.

Lee discusses the complexities of belonging to a sacred land that is also a luxury tourist destination, where high property taxes threaten to displace the very community that has been there for generations.

          <p>In recent congressional testimony, leaders from UC Berkeley, CUNY, and Georgetown affirmed that denying the Jewish people's right to self-determination is a form of antisemitism. This commentary argues that their clear stance helps cut through the long-standing debate over whether anti-Zionism is antisemitic. The author contends that because anti-Zionism singles out the Jewish state for elimination and denies a right afforded to other peoples, it is inherently discriminatory. This recognition is presented as a crucial step toward focusing campus debates on Israel's policies rather than its right to exist, thereby protecting Jewish students from ostracism.</p>
