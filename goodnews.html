          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm increased by 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company announced earnings of 20 cents per share and a 33% year-over-year revenue increase to $876 million, signaling robust consumer spending. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance, highlighting growth in consumer transactions and merchant partnerships, which offset concerns about losing Walmart as a client.

          <p>Alibaba's stock rose nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its June quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. The cloud division's revenue grew 26% year-over-year, largely due to strong demand for artificial intelligence services, which has seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the robust performance of the cloud business and a revival in e-commerce have bolstered investor confidence. The company is continuing to invest heavily in AI and new e-commerce models to maintain its competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a transfer bid from the Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who was the club's second-most expensive signing, is said to have been given permission to travel to Spain for a medical. Antony had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, helping the team secure a European competition spot. This permanent move marks the end of a disappointing tenure at Manchester United, where his performance declined significantly after a promising start.</p>

The home invasion involved two men who entered through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars worth of personal items. The arrest was made after a broader investigation into high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities in the area. Law enforcement officials were able to recover some of the stolen items from a jewelry store in south Seattle, leading them to the suspect.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has officially launched her campaign for a U.S. congressional seat, contingent on California voters approving a new district map in a November special election. A former Secretary of Labor and member of Congress, Solis is seeking to run in the newly redrawn 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent. The proposed redistricting plan, pushed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to favor Democrats and could influence the balance of power in Congress. Solis has already secured endorsements from prominent figures, signaling strong establishment support for her potential candidacy.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off Long Island, New York. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector on a beach. Instead of selling the valuable palladium ring, the finder used the engravings to track down the original owner through a university alumni group on Facebook. The owner, Al DiStefano, now 77, called the return a "miracle," celebrating a heartwarming story of honesty and connection across decades and distance.</p>

          <p>Several cast members are leaving "Saturday Night Live" ahead of its 51st season, including eight-season veteran Heidi Gardner. Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim also announced their departures from the long-running sketch comedy show. The exits follow the show's 50th-anniversary season, after which creator Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for a shake-up to reinvent the program. Gardner was known for popular "Weekend Update" characters like Angel and teenage film critic Bailey Gismert, while the other departing members were more recent additions to the cast.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new details about Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, scientists now have a clearer picture of the dinosaur, which featured long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs—a trait never before seen in any vertebrate. This unique and elaborate armor has led researchers to dub it the "punk rocker" of its time. The discovery of such complex defensive features on an early ankylosaur is challenging previous theories about how this group of "tank-like" dinosaurs evolved.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive victory in the town's first election in decades. Four years ago, after running unopposed, Braxton said he was locked out of the town hall by previous White officials who refused to recognize his leadership in the majority-Black town. This led to a federal lawsuit challenging the town's "hand-me-down" system of governance, where mayors appointed their successors without elections. The recent election, held as part of a legal settlement, overwhelmingly confirmed Braxton's mandate, marking a significant moment for democratic governance in the small community.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on smaller tours featuring his original songs, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his signature large-scale productions with the "Bigger & Weirder" tour. Yankovic explains that he stepped away from his famous parodies partly because he wanted to prove he was "more than just the parody guy" and because the fragmented pop culture landscape made it harder to select universally known hits. Now, he is re-embracing the elaborate costume changes, props, and classic parodies that made him famous, backed by an expanded band to replicate the layered sounds of the original songs.</p>
