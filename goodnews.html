          <p>Scientists at Caltech are creating "cyborg jellyfish" by embedding microelectric controllers into the animals, allowing them to be remotely guided for ocean exploration. This innovative approach aims to collect environmental data at a significantly lower cost than traditional underwater robots, potentially democratizing ocean research. The jellyfish are ideal subjects as they lack a central nervous system, have no pain receptors, and possess remarkable regenerative abilities. Researchers are now working to enhance the devices for deep-sea pressures and to enable horizontal steering, hoping to deploy swarms of these biohybrid robots to uncover oceanic mysteries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the cost of package holidays soaring, many travelers are employing creative money-saving tactics to afford their summer getaways. Strategies include booking last-minute deals, which allowed one couple to secure a two-week all-inclusive trip to Mexico for less than the price of a European holiday. Other methods involve traveling off-peak, finding "kids go free" offers, using home-swapping websites to avoid accommodation costs, and collecting credit card loyalty points for flights. For those staying domestic, house-sitting offers a way to enjoy a vacation in a new location without paying for lodging, significantly reducing overall holiday expenses.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, scheduled from July 25th, is over a pay dispute, with doctors rejecting the government's 5.4% increase for the year. The BMA argues that real-term pay has fallen significantly since 2008 and seeks a path to restore its value. While the government insists it cannot improve the pay offer, there is hope talks could lead to progress on improving working conditions.</p>

          <p>Six years after his triumphant victory, Shane Lowry is returning to Royal Portrush for The Open Championship, recalling one of golf's most memorable moments. In 2019, the Irishman secured the Claret Jug with a dominant six-shot win, ending a 68-year wait for an Open champion on the island of Ireland. Lowry's performance, especially his third-round 63, created an electrifying atmosphere that he remembers as the most incredible experience of his career. Now a more seasoned player, he acknowledges the heightened expectations but feels well-equipped to perform again on the historic course where he achieved his greatest success.</p>

          <h2>Taylor-Serrano Trilogy Highlights Progress and Contradictions in Women's Boxing</h2>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden showcased the evolution of women's boxing, moving beyond the need for chaotic brawls to prove its legitimacy. While their first two encounters were fiery, the final bout was a tactical, controlled affair, which the article argues is a form of progress, granting female fighters the right to win strategically. The piece reflects on the sport's contradictions, where women reclaim their bodies through risk but still face disparities like lower pay and the sexualized imagery of ring girls. Ultimately, it frames the trilogy as a historic moment of choice and defiance.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is being auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was found in Niger in 2023. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its authenticity was confirmed by a specialized lab that matched its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking probe. The auction highlights the rarity of such extraterrestrial artifacts.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England and setting new warmest-day-of-the-year records in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and central England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The intense heat has led to hosepipe bans and wildfire warnings. However, the Met Office forecasts a change starting Monday, with cooler Atlantic air bringing temperatures down and providing "welcome rainfall" to many parts of the country.</p>

          <p>After a four-decade conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish state, initiating a disarmament process. The move, which follows a call for peace from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a major opportunity for reconciliation, though significant hurdles remain. The PKK is demanding Ocalan's release and amnesty for its fighters, while the Turkish government remains cautious, waiting for the group to fully dismantle. If successful, the peace process could resolve a conflict that has killed over 40,000 people and improve Turkey's regional standing.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its historic broadcast on July 13, 1985, the Live Aid concert is being remembered as a watershed moment in global activism and a flawed cultural touchstone. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, the event united billions of viewers and featured an unprecedented lineup of rock royalty. However, retrospective analyses highlight its significant shortcomings, particularly the lack of African performers and female artists, which critics argue reinforced a "white savior" narrative. Despite these criticisms, Live Aid raised millions and successfully placed global poverty on the political agenda, leaving a complex legacy.</p>
