          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi announced he would cover the educational expenses for 22 children from Jammu and Kashmir, orphaned during the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. These children are from the Poonch district, a border area severely impacted by shelling and drone attacks that resulted in 28 deaths. The Jammu and Kashmir Congress confirmed Gandhi's commitment to sponsor their education through graduation, with the first financial aid installment due soon. This humanitarian gesture follows Gandhi's recent visit to the bereaved families in the region, emphasizing support for those affected by the devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions, which recently merged with Sapeon, has secured investment from Samsung and aims to raise up to $200 million in a new funding round before its initial public offering. The company, valued at over $1 billion, designs AI inferencing chips, interpreting live data for AI models like chatbots. Rebellions plans to challenge industry giants Nvidia and AMD in the inferencing market, leveraging Samsung's 4-nanometer manufacturing process for its second-generation Rebel chip. This strategic collaboration could significantly boost Samsung's foundry business if Rebellions secures a large customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Guangzhou’s Baiyun Airport and Shenzhen’s Baoan Airport have achieved record-high passenger numbers in the first half of 2025, successfully surpassing their pre-pandemic levels. Guangzhou processed 40.04 million passengers, marking a 9.2% year-on-year increase, while Shenzhen served 32.55 million, a 10.8% rise. This robust growth underscores the vibrant business activity and strong demand from mainland tourists within these Chinese cities. Conversely, Hong Kong International Airport, despite a 16.5% year-on-year increase, still lags behind its 2019 passenger volume, suggesting a notable shift in market share and competitiveness within the Greater Bay Area aviation sector.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged this week, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5% since December. This benchmark rate, while influencing interbank lending, has shown a subtle trickle-down effect on consumer borrowing and savings rates. Credit card rates have slightly nudged down to around 20.1% from a peak near 21%, while auto loans and 30-year fixed mortgages have seen very little movement. Experts note that a Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee lower consumer costs, as mortgage rates are more tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy, potentially rising with increased inflation.

Gilpin defended the match officials, stating they "stand by their decision" after review and emphasized World Rugby's significant investment in player welfare research and technology.

          <p>Experts suggest the UK could be an unexpected beneficiary of the new EU-U.S. trade agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported to the U.S., compared to the UK's 10% levy. This tariff differential could make British exports relatively cheaper, potentially boosting UK trade as American firms might favor British products. Additionally, EU-based manufacturers with tight profit margins may consider relocating some production to the UK to avoid higher tariffs, leveraging the UK's spare manufacturing capacity post-Brexit. While both the UK and EU face a tougher trade environment, the deal averts a more severe transatlantic trade war, which also benefits the UK. (not investment advice)</p>
