          <h2>Montana Supreme Court Upholds Ruling Against Several Abortion Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 05:33:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Montana Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's decision to strike down several state laws restricting abortion access, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. The court cited the state constitution's "right to be left alone" as encompassing abortion access, unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws also included restrictions on telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication and mandatory waiting periods. The ruling reinforces abortion rights in Montana, though an anti-abortion group has filed a lawsuit challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution. The ruling indicates a continued legal battle over abortion rights in Montana.</p>

          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may allow companies listed in Hong Kong to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen, potentially expanding their access to mainland capital.

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea as a gesture to "restore trust" between the two countries. This action follows the election of new president Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. Pyongyang views these broadcasts as an act of war and has previously threatened retaliation. While organizations advocating for North Korean human rights have criticized the suspension, residents along the border have welcomed the move, citing the disturbance caused by the broadcasts. The decision reflects a shift in South Korea's approach towards North Korea, aiming for dialogue and reduced tensions.</p>
