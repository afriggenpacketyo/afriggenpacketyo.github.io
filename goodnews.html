        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the common stereotype that straight men are inept at gossiping, delving into the underlying reasons and implications of this perception. It references studies, including one from 2019, that debunk the myth that women gossip more negatively than men, while highlighting that women engage in neutral gossip more frequently. The piece suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossiping stems from fewer cultural opportunities to engage in open and free-flowing social discussions. Ultimately, the article posits that improving men's ability to gossip could potentially alleviate the male loneliness epidemic by fostering deeper connections and intimacy. The article also touches upon the idea that men fear incriminating themselves by sharing personal stories with others, which inhibits their ability to form close friendships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League has released its 2025-26 season fixtures, but a warning has been issued regarding potential game rescheduling due to European matches. With nine English teams participating in European competitions, including six in the Champions League, there is an increased likelihood of fixtures being moved with relatively short notice. This situation presents challenges for team managers, especially with international windows and long midweek away trips. The first expanded lot of TV fixtures will require careful consideration to avoid conflicts with Champions League matches. This may prove irritating for managers, but it is a reality of the modern game.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manufacturers are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duties amid rising tariffs, by altering product materials or dimensions to fit into different harmonized system codes. This practice involves strategically redesigning products to qualify for lower tariff rates, which is not inherently illegal. Companies in sectors like consumer goods and garments find it easier to implement such changes. However, heavily regulated industries like automotive and aerospace face greater challenges due to extensive testing and approval requirements. A Supreme Court ruling from 1882 deemed this practice legal as long as the goods are honestly presented to customs officials. (not investment advice)</p>

Honda aims to develop the technology for a suborbital launch by 2029, anticipating increased demand for satellite launch rockets. The company intends to utilize its existing technologies in automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets for communication tools and environmental monitoring.

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, barring women in England and Wales from being prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term. This marks the biggest reform to British abortion laws in nearly 60 years, allowing abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and beyond that in certain cases. The new law addresses cases where women ended pregnancies outside approved rules, such as buying pills online. While the law still needs approval in the House of Lords, it is expected to pass, marking a significant shift in abortion regulations.</p>
