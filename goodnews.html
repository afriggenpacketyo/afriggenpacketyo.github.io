          <h2>The Forgotten History of How Three Hawaiian Princes Introduced Surfing to Mainland America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, illuminates the pivotal role of three Hawaiian princes in introducing surfing to the U.S. mainland in 1885. The teenage royals, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were studying at a nearby military school when they crafted surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the sport. Their feats, chronicled in local newspapers, planted the seeds for surfing's popularity, which would later be globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku. The story highlights a significant moment of cultural exchange and the deep royal roots of the sport in Hawaiian tradition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is set to ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its broader campaign against single-use plastics. The iconic containers, invented in Japan in 1954, are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. Officials stated that while the containers are made of recyclable plastic, their small size prevents them from being processed correctly by recycling machinery. The ban, effective September 1, is part of a larger government effort to reduce pollution, cut carbon emissions, and protect marine life.</p>

          <p>An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum celebrates the prolific artistic relationship between painter Alex Katz and his wife, Ada, who has been the subject of over 300 of his portraits. Katz, who came to prominence in the 1960s with his distinct brand of realism, considers Ada his primary muse since they met at a party. Curators note that his interest is less in capturing her soul and more in style, fashion, and the interplay of light and form. This artistic detachment allows his portraits to act as a mirror, with many viewers seeing themselves reflected in his iconic depictions of Ada.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Personal Happiness Amid Global Crises and Suffering</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the moral dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering. Drawing on religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling the world's pain is a natural and moral response. However, this empathy should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or mudita. The article suggests that embracing both the horrors and delights of the world allows for a more balanced and resilient emotional state, preventing spirals into cynicism or guilt.</p>

          <p>With the transfer deadline approaching, Manchester United is reportedly considering a late bid for Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez. The club has been actively seeking to strengthen its goalkeeping position and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, the 31-year-old Martinez offers a wealth of high-level Premier League and international experience that the younger Lammens lacks. The potential move comes as United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, acknowledged the immense pressure currently faced by the team's goalkeepers.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is warning parents about the critical importance of school attendance during the first week of the new term, citing data that links early absences to chronic absenteeism. According to new figures, over half of the students who missed some school in the first week of 2024 became persistently absent, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels. Phillipson urged a collaborative effort between schools and parents to ensure children get a strong start to the academic year.</p>

          <p>In a rare commercial contract with a North American company, Chinese launch provider CAS Space has successfully deployed two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a start-up based in Tijuana, Mexico. The femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, were launched into orbit aboard a Kinetica-1 rocket. This mission marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and is seen by CAS Space as a significant milestone for China's entry into the North American launch market. The project aims to demonstrate the viability of small, meaningful satellites and engage students through low-cost ground receiving stations.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval is at a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism, pointing to a growing lead in generic congressional ballots and an emerging field of energetic potential presidential candidates. Political analysts suggest that voter motivation is increasingly driven by "negative partisanship," meaning dislike for the opposing party can be more powerful than affection for one's own. Strategists are outlining a recovery plan focused on opposing President Trump, addressing economic concerns like affordability, and organizing for the 2026 midterm elections. The party is also engaged in a necessary internal debate over its messaging and policy priorities.</p>

          <p>The leaders of China and India have expressed a commitment to improving their relationship during a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that the two nations should be partners, not rivals, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on his first visit to China in seven years, noted an "atmosphere of peace and stability." This diplomatic warming comes as both nations face trade pressures from the United States. Modi also announced that direct flights between the two countries, suspended since border clashes in 2020, would resume.</p>
