        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks associated with the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) have seen significant gains, driven by a renewed focus on tokenization and stablecoins. Companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, which have adopted ETH treasury strategies, experienced substantial stock jumps. This resurgence is linked to the Ethereum network's utility for creating digital representations of real-world assets and the launch of products like BlackRock's tokenized money market fund. The trend follows Robinhood's expansion of tokenized stock trading in Europe, highlighting growing real-world applications for the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Corey Parchman has released a new book, "IVF Playbook for Men," to address the stigma and lack of resources for men experiencing infertility. Parchman shared his personal journey of undergoing five IVF cycles with his wife, a process that he found isolating due to the scarcity of support for men. He emphasized that male factors contribute to at least 30% of infertility cases and aims to create a "safe space" for men to discuss their feelings and experiences. The book advocates for open communication between partners and encourages men to be more vulnerable about their struggles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae pose a severe threat to livestock, wildlife, and even pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago and is being revived as the fly migrates north from Panama.</p>

          <p>British university student and world number 733 Ollie Tarvet saw his surprising Wimbledon journey come to an end in the second round against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Despite the straight-sets loss, the 21-year-old qualifier put up a strong fight on Centre Court, creating eleven break points against the world number two. Tarvet, who plays college tennis in the U.S., showed significant potential and earned praise from Alcaraz for his performance. His run through qualifying and the first round has brought him unexpected attention, though he plans to return to university to complete his degree.</p>

          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) system outages and a surge in summer travel, airlines and pilots are highlighting the multiple layers of training and redundant systems in place to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle lost communications, with procedures including switching to backup radio frequencies and using a universal emergency channel. Modern aircraft are also equipped with text-based communication systems and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously prevents mid-air collisions. While these safety measures are robust, ATC outages can still lead to significant flight delays as traffic is limited in affected areas.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have reached a trade agreement that will impose a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the U.S., a lower rate than the 46% initially proposed by President Trump. The deal also reportedly grants U.S. exports, including large-engine vehicles, tariff-free access to the Vietnamese market. Additionally, it includes a 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries to prevent evasion of other U.S. levies. This agreement follows a surge in U.S. imports from Vietnam since tariffs were imposed on China, and it is part of a broader effort to renegotiate trade relationships globally.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, as a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify a portfolio, offering stability when stock markets are volatile. The accessibility of gold has increased, with major retailers and online companies making it easy to buy and sell. For those concerned about the high price per ounce, fractional gold bars and coins provide a more affordable entry point, allowing investors to secure the protective benefits of the precious metal.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that the type of hormone therapy used for menopause symptoms can significantly affect breast cancer risk for women under 55. The research found that for women who still have a uterus and require a combination of estrogen and progesterone, there is a slight increase in breast cancer risk. Conversely, for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk. This evolving science highlights the importance of personalized medical advice, as treatment effectiveness and risks depend on individual health factors.</p>
