          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be legally sold separately from the main property it shares a lot with. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this new housing model could serve as an accessible entry point into the property market and be replicated by other cities. Amid a statewide housing shortage, ADUs have become increasingly popular, accounting for a significant portion of California's recent housing growth.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel but fulfilled his promise by conducting the Illinois-based band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, who served in World War II, emphasized the importance of keeping one's word as his motivation for honoring the unique agreement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution sources are more diverse, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The report's lead author recommends shifting focus from controlling dust at the source to protecting residents through exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration.</p>

          <p>New research from two clinical trials in India challenges the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, could actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes. One study showed that mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than bread. Researchers emphasize that portion control is crucial and that the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption, but they offer hope for diabetics who wish to enjoy the popular fruit.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, has sparked conversation by altering an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. The artwork, part of a larger tribute to the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win, depicts Bryant in his famous celebratory pose but swaps his gold Lakers jersey for a white and blue Dodgers-themed one. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained the change was intended to honor Bryant, who was a Dodgers fan, while staying on theme with the mural. While the tribute has been mostly well-received, it has also generated debate among fans about altering the well-known image of the Lakers legend.</p>

The company plans to sell over 100 accessories and make the platform "open source" for third-party additions. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's starting price may be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment.</p>

The agreement, which still allows for federal use of MPD officers in emergencies, came after the city filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover."
