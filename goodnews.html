        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oklahoma's new Superintendent, Lindel Fields, has officially rescinded a controversial mandate from his predecessor that required public schools to place Bibles in classrooms and incorporate them into curricula for grades 5-12. This reversal also includes plans to dismiss lawsuits filed against the previous administration over these religious directives. Fields stated that the decision on Bible incorporation should rest with individual districts and that funding Bibles is not the best use of taxpayer resources. This move marks a significant shift away from conservative efforts to integrate religion into public education, with the agency also reviewing other mandates from the former superintendent.</p>

Ramaswamy, endorsed by Trump, is focusing on his own Ohio gubernatorial bid but views these contests as crucial for national Republican momentum.

          <p>Microsoft is introducing a new Copilot AI feature in Windows 11 that will allow the assistant to perform tasks on locally stored files using desktop and web applications. This feature, available to Windows Insider Program and Copilot Labs participants, aims to automate multi-step actions like resizing photos or organizing music. Following the end of Windows 10 support, Microsoft is enticing users to upgrade with these AI capabilities. The company is proceeding cautiously, with the feature operating in a contained environment and requiring user approval for data access, indicating a strategic push to enhance Windows 11's appeal through advanced AI integration.</p>

          <p>American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison has made history by becoming the first person to successfully ski down Mount Everest's North Face, specifically the "Supercouloir" and Hornbein Couloir. On October 15, 2025, Morrison completed the perilous descent, which involved navigating steep rock gullies filled with snow and ice, after scattering the ashes of his deceased partner, Hilaree Nelson, at the summit. This achievement followed two previous attempts and is considered extremely difficult and dangerous, with few having even attempted the route. Morrison's feat is a remarkable tribute to his partner and a significant milestone in extreme mountaineering.</p>

          <p>Cardiff is proposing to become the first UK city to implement a parking premium for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and other large, highly polluting vehicles. The 10-year plan, awaiting council approval, aims to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and encourage public transport use. Under the new system, the city would be divided into three zones, with resident permits in the city center abolished and a surcharge applied to cars over 2,400kg. While some residents support the environmental goals, others, particularly tradespeople and students, express concerns about fairness and reliance on vehicles for work or safety, highlighting divided public opinion.</p>
