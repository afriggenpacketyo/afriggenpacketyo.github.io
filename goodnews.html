        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China reported a substantial surge in rare earth exports for June, reaching their highest level since 2009 with a 60% year-over-year increase. This rise follows reports that Beijing has begun issuing six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers and is easing trade approval processes for European nations. The data suggests a potential relaxation of China's previously tight controls on these critical minerals, which could signal a thaw in trade tensions with the United States and Europe.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended the FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, where he watched Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain. During an interview, he praised FIFA president Gianni Infantino and joked about potentially signing an executive order to officially change the name of "soccer" to "football" in the United States. When asked about the greatest player of all time, Trump named the Brazilian legend Pelé, recalling his time playing for the New York Cosmos in a packed stadium.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, the UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting a potential shift to a mutual ownership model. This would place the organization in the hands of its postmasters, a move intended to rebuild trust and transform its culture after hundreds were wrongly convicted. The consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking, while the government has committed to maintaining the current network size.</p>

          <p>Following a social media post where Donald Trump stated he was considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's US citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the US are citizens, and the president lacks the authority to strip citizenship from a native-born American. The article contextualizes the threat within the long-standing feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland in response to his reelection.</p>

          <p>Analysts anticipate that the price of gold, which has risen to over $3,300 per ounce, will likely maintain its value for the remainder of 2025. Key drivers supporting the precious metal include persistent inflation, ongoing geopolitical instability, and strong consumer demand from both new and existing investors. While new record highs may depend on fresh economic risks, the current market dynamics suggest a stable and potentially upward trajectory for gold as investors continue to seek it as a safe-haven asset.

          <p>A sex and psychotherapy expert explains that true intimacy is crucial for a thriving relationship and is about more than just physical connection. The article identifies four surprising intimacy blockers: constant phone use, unresolved feelings about an ex, a persistent negativity bias, and an unmanaged stress response. The therapist provides practical advice for couples to overcome these hurdles, such as setting screen-free zones and openly communicating about their emotional needs, to foster a deeper, more vulnerable connection.</p>

          <p>While the national average interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain modest, savers can find significantly higher returns by looking at online banks and short-term CDs. Top 1-year CD rates are currently reaching around 4.40% APY, far exceeding the national average of 2.01% and offering a return that outpaces inflation. Experts suggest that due to an inverted yield curve, shorter-term CDs presently offer better rates than longer-term ones, making a laddering strategy a potentially effective approach.

The man broke out by hiding inside a large laundry bag that was carried out by a fellow inmate who was being legitimately released from the facility. The unusual escape, which prison officials called an extremely rare event resulting from serious dysfunctions, prompted an extensive investigation that led to the man's arrest early Monday morning in a nearby town, with his accomplice still at large.</p>
