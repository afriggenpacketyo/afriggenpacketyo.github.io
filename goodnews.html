          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a first group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This government-led operation, coordinated by several departments, will see the children selected by the World Health Organization and travel with family members. The initiative follows a letter from 96 cross-party MPs urging the government to act without delay, highlighting the decimated healthcare system in the region. The children will be treated by the National Health Service, and given the difficulty of returning to Gaza, some may enter the asylum system after their treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a positive opening as investors focus on a crucial meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and several European leaders. The talks in Washington are aimed at discussing a potential peace deal to end the war with Russia, following a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin that concluded without a ceasefire. Market indices in the U.K., Germany, and France are all projected to open higher, reflecting cautious optimism about the diplomatic efforts. Zelenskyy is expected to face pressure to accept a deal, with Trump suggesting the Ukrainian president could end the war almost immediately. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets traded higher as investors anticipated the outcome of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian leaders aimed at ending the war with Russia. Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 saw notable gains, with the latter hitting its highest level since October 2024, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. The diplomatic meeting in Washington follows a U.S.-Russia summit that did not produce a ceasefire, leaving market sentiment cautiously optimistic but watchful. Meanwhile, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports contracted more than expected in July, shrinking by 4.6% compared to the previous year, signaling regional economic headwinds.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a potentially significant development, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, this concession was made during the recent summit with President Trump and could serve as a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. While details remain sparse, the proposal is being described as a "game-changing" step toward a peace deal. The development comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders prepare to meet with Trump to discuss the terms of a potential resolution to the war.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index surged to a 10-year high, reflecting a strong risk-on sentiment among investors on mainland China. The index advanced 1.2 percent to a level not seen since August 2015, driven by investors seeking higher returns as yields on government bonds and interest rates on deposits remain low. This shift from fixed-income products to equities marks a significant turnaround for Chinese stocks after years of underperformance. The rally was broad-based, with technology and startup benchmarks also experiencing significant jumps, indicating renewed confidence in the market's growth potential and the appeal of dividend yields from stocks.

          <p>An Australian court has ordered Qantas Airways to pay a record A$90 million ($58.64 million) fine for illegally firing 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Court ruled in 2021 that the airline's decision to outsource the jobs was an unlawful "adverse action" to prevent staff from exercising their workplace rights. In his ruling, the judge criticized the airline for a lack of genuine contrition, suggesting its expressions of regret were more about reputational damage than harm caused to workers. This penalty is the largest ever ordered for a violation of Australia's labor laws and follows a separate A$120 million compensation agreement with the sacked employees.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen Mirren has stated her belief that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, she argued in an interview that changing the character's gender "just doesn't work" and that "James Bond has to be James Bond." Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, who is her co-star in an upcoming film. The comments come as producers plan the 26th installment of the spy franchise with a new actor in the lead role. The debate over whether a woman could or should play the character has been ongoing for years within the industry and among fans.</p>

          <p>A renewed wave of Pan-Africanism is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, as people reconnect with their African heritage through culture, travel, and economic initiatives. This trend is visible in the growing popularity of African food, the global rise of Afrobeats music, and an increase in tourism from the Caribbean to African nations like Ghana and South Africa. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic are also fostering stronger ties, with institutions like Afreximbank aiming to more than double trade between the regions. This modern movement, amplified by social media, is shifting focus beyond cultural pride to tangible economic and transportation links, signaling a new phase of intercontinental cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including internet slang terms like "skibidi" and "tradwife." "Skibidi" is a nonsensical word popularized by a viral YouTube series, while "tradwife" refers to a woman who promotes a traditional homemaker role on social media. Other new entries reflect modern culture, such as "delulu" (a shortened form of delusional) and "mouse jiggler" (a device for feigning activity while working remotely). Lexicographers note that the rapid inclusion of such terms highlights the significant and fascinating impact that internet culture is having on the evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, finishing two shots clear of the field after a dramatic final round.

Scheffler demonstrated his composure, carding a three-under 67, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in for birdie on the 17th hole that effectively sealed his win. The victory marks Scheffler's 18th career PGA Tour success and serves as another display of his dominance in the sport, while leaving MacIntyre to lament a significant missed opportunity.</p>
