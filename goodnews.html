          <p>Frank Bisignano, the new head of the Social Security Administration, revealed during a town hall that he had to Google the agency after being offered the job, despite having no prior experience in government or with the Social Security system. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, aims to modernize the agency and improve its services, drawing comparisons to tech giants like Amazon. He also reassured managers that Social Security is not going away and that he does not intend to implement reductions in force. Bisignano addressed concerns about recent leadership turnover and scrutiny from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), suggesting that DOGE is helping to improve the agency. </p>

          <p>A House bill proposes creating $1,000 "Trump accounts" for every child born in the U.S. between 2025 and 2029, managed by banks or investment firms and invested in the stock market. Families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, with funds usable for expenses like a down payment on a home, education, or starting a business. Withdrawals before age 18 would be taxed as income, while withdrawals between 25 and 30 for approved purposes would be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Experts suggest improvements could be made to the program, particularly around account withdrawals and taxes, and note that the tax benefits of the proposed accounts are questionable.

          <p>Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have recommended that COVID-19 vaccines be updated to target a variant closer to currently circulating strains, specifically those related to the JN.1 variant, for the upcoming fall and winter seasons. This recommendation aligns with the World Health Organization's advice and reflects the virus's ongoing evolution into new subvariants of omicron. The decision comes as the FDA announced a new approach to COVID vaccines that may restrict access to the shots, requiring additional studies for younger, healthy adults. The current mRNA vaccines target the KP.2 strain, while Novavax's shot targets a JN.1 strain.</p>

Currently, many cemeteries operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and National Parks Service are closed on major holidays, except for Arlington National Cemetery, which is open on Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Daines emphasizes the importance of allowing families to pay their respects to fallen service members on special days like Memorial Day, noting the bill aims to honor their sacrifices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a move driven by legal challenges and strategic considerations. The government feared that without ceding sovereignty, the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to rulings by UN bodies asserting Mauritius's claim to the islands. The agreement aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence in the islands and addresses accusations of hypocrisy regarding the UK's stance on international law. The deal is supported by the US and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, but faces criticism from those who believe the legal threat is exaggerated and the UK is being overly submissive to international lawyers.</p>

Referencing Joseph Alsop's 1953 defense of unrestricted free thought, the piece highlights the need to protect the freedom to think "bad thoughts as well as good." It draws parallels between the McCarthy era and contemporary threats to academic freedom, including the Trump administration's actions against foreign students and the suppression of dissenting views on college campuses, underscoring the need to uphold principles of free thought and due process.</p>
