          <p>After being found abandoned in a USPS truck for three days, thousands of chicks have been adopted by local families, rescues, and farms in Delaware. The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended, leading to many deaths due to high temperatures and lack of food and water. The First State Animal Center and SPCA cared for the survivors and ensured they were adopted by those who would not use them for meat, with some adopters taking hundreds at a time. Stephanie Bruzdzinski adopted a handful of chicks after her daughter expressed concern for their well-being, highlighting the community's response to the unfortunate incident.</p>

          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis), when compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Simultaneously, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions, balancing economic progress with international security responsibilities. The German economy, Europe's leading economy, navigates global trade tensions while maintaining its commitments to international peacekeeping efforts.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China to stimulate demand in a key market where it faces increasing competition from local rivals. The trade-in value for the iPhone 15 Pro Max has increased to 5,700 Chinese yuan, up from 5,625 yuan previously. This move is part of Apple's ongoing strategy to offer discounts and incentives, especially around holiday periods. In the first quarter of the year, Apple's China shipments fell by 8% year-on-year, and its market share declined from 15% to 13%, highlighting the need for Apple to revitalize its sales amid competition from Xiaomi and Huawei.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced a 7% fall in energy bills for households in England, Scotland, and Wales starting in July, marking the first drop in a year. This decrease means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their annual bill fall by ¬£129. While charities welcome the cheaper bills, they emphasize that many people still struggle to pay, with millions of customers owing about ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The drop reflects a fall in the international price of wholesale gas, but prices remain high, and concerns persist about energy affordability for vulnerable households.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to an unbelievable sight: a massive container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, missing his house by mere meters. The 135-meter ship, the NCL Salten, went off course in the Trondheim Fjord, startling Johan Helberg and his neighbor. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship had 16 people on board, and while no one was injured, the incident is under investigation by Norwegian police. The head of NCL, which chartered the ship, called it a "serious incident" and expressed gratitude that no one was hurt.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to produce its final penny following President Donald Trump's decree to abolish the coin, citing its wasteful production cost. Trump claims that the penny, made from zinc with a copper coating, costs more than two cents to mint, leading to annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. While advocates support ditching the penny due to its high production cost and limited utility, others point to its usefulness in charity drives. The move requires congressional legislation to ensure prices are rounded up, eliminating demand for the coin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after abruptly pausing it in March. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially suspended on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer fund travel for programs deemed not "mission critical". However, a comprehensive review led FEMA to reverse course, acknowledging that certain courses provide effective training. The decision is a reprieve for Emmitsburg and the firefighting community, who heavily criticized the initial pause.</p>
