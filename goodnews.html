        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent report, housing affordability has improved to its best level in more than two and a half years, creating a potential opportunity for prospective buyers. With mortgage rates falling, the principal and interest payment on an average-priced home now constitutes 30% of the median household income, down from a peak of 35% in late 2023. Further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are anticipated, which could make borrowing even cheaper. However, this increased affordability may also lead to greater buyer competition in the near future, suggesting a limited window for action (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Columbus Crew captain and decorated midfielder Darlington Nagbe has announced he will retire at the end of the current MLS season. The 35-year-old has had a distinguished 15-season career, winning four MLS Cups with three different clubs: the Portland Timbers, Atlanta United, and Columbus Crew. Nagbe, who was born in Liberia and represented the United States internationally, is known for his consistent performance and leadership on the field. He ranks fifth in league history with 444 regular-season appearances and will finish his career having helped the Crew clinch a playoff spot this season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners suggest that when choosing between pretax (traditional) and Roth 401(k) contributions, savers should consider their effective tax rate rather than just their marginal rate. While the marginal rate applies to the last dollar earned, the effective rate is the average tax paid on total income, which is often much lower. An individual in the 24% marginal bracket might have an effective tax rate closer to 18.5%, a figure that could be higher than their expected effective rate in retirement. This calculation provides a different perspective, potentially making pretax contributions more advantageous for some (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Federal Reserve rate cuts making borrowing cheaper, a $25,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable option compared to high-interest credit cards. Currently, the monthly payment for such a HELOC would be approximately $302 for a 10-year term or $237 for a 15-year term, based on average rates. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly less than a year ago. HELOCs also offer the flexibility of making interest-only payments during the initial draw period, which can further lower immediate monthly expenses for homeowners (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla has launched a new, more affordable standard-range version of its popular Model Y SUV, with a starting price of $39,990. The vehicle, which is now available for order on the company's website, features rear-wheel drive and an estimated range of 321 miles. This release is part of Tesla's strategy to boost sales volume amid a multi-quarter slump and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. The move comes after the expiration of a federal EV tax credit, with CEO Elon Musk previously indicating a lower-cost model would follow that event.</p>

          <p>A major rescue operation in Tibet has successfully guided 580 hikers to safety after they were trapped by an unexpected blizzard near Mount Everest. The trekkers, along with 300 local support staff, became stranded at an altitude of over 16,000 feet when heavy snowfall blocked their route on the Karma Valley trail. The storm struck during a peak tourist week, catching many experienced hikers off guard with its intensity. Police, firefighters, and hundreds of local volunteers were mobilized for the rescue, navigating snow that was reportedly a meter deep in some areas.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock rise after announcing increased long-term expectations for revenue and profit growth during an analyst meeting.

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner are traveling to Egypt to participate in ongoing indirect talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza. The negotiations are centered on a U.S.-proposed plan that includes the release of remaining hostages, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of international governance in the territory. While the plan has received broad international support, Hamas has not yet agreed to the disarmament clause, reiterating its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal. The talks resume as the conflict, which has created a severe humanitarian crisis, marks its two-year anniversary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An emergency room physician pushes back against political rhetoric blaming undocumented immigrants for long hospital wait times, calling the claims factually incorrect. The doctor explains that the primary cause of ER crowding is "boarding," where admitted patients are held in the ER because no inpatient beds are available. Furthermore, the 1986 EMTALA law, signed by President Reagan, legally requires emergency departments to screen and stabilize all patients regardless of their immigration or insurance status. The author argues that focusing on immigrants distracts from the real issues of hospital capacity, staffing, and funding cuts that truly drive delays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees looking to buy a new home without taking on monthly mortgage payments can use a specific financial product called a HECM for Purchase loan. This type of reverse mortgage allows individuals aged 62 and older to combine a significant down payment, typically 45% to 62% of the home's price, with funds from the loan to buy a primary residence. The loan balance grows over time and is repaid only when the owner sells the home, moves out, or passes away. This option can be advantageous for seniors who are "house rich but cash limited" (not investment advice).</p>

The paintings, with a total estimated value between $850,000 and $1.4 million, will be sold by Bonhams auction house.

          <p>Despite concerns that a government shutdown could harm investment portfolios, historical market performance suggests otherwise. So far in the current shutdown, the S&P 500 has seen modest gains, and analysis of past events shows this is not unusual. For instance, in the year following the 2019 shutdown, the S&P 500 increased by 36%. Financial experts note that markets are forward-looking and tend to disregard short-term political turmoil, often rewarding investors who remain patient and maintain a diversified portfolio rather than reacting to headlines (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Two key organizers of the 2022 "Freedom Convoy" protest in Canada, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, have received conditional sentences, allowing them to avoid further incarceration. After being found guilty of mischief, they were sentenced to 18 months, with the first 12 to be served under house arrest and the remaining six under a curfew, along with community service. The protest, which was initiated against COVID-19 vaccine mandates, blockaded the streets of Ottawa for three weeks.

Trump indicated a willingness to renegotiate the USMCA trade agreement, stating that the two nations compete for business in sectors like the auto industry.

For those who have not yet invested, the article suggests several strategies to enter the market more affordably before prices potentially climb higher. These methods include purchasing fractional gold, using dollar-cost averaging, and exploring gold-backed financial products like ETFs or IRAs (not investment advice).</p>
