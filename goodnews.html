          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing analysts' forecasts and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite the strong GDP figure, other indicators suggest underlying fragility, including slowing retail sales growth and a deepening slump in real estate investment. These mixed signals have fueled calls for further government stimulus and structural reforms to address deflationary pressures and boost domestic consumption. Officials have acknowledged the need to support spending and stabilize the property market for sustained recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SiriusXM has introduced its first ad-supported subscription tier for in-car listening, named SiriusXM Play, priced under $7 per month. This strategic shift aims to attract and retain customers who do not convert after free trials, mirroring a model successfully used by companies like Netflix. While popular content like Howard Stern and live sports will remain ad-free, the new, cheaper option is designed to drive revenue growth amid a competitive audio market. The company expects the plan to be available in nearly 100 million vehicles by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>This book review examines Linn Ullmann's latest novel, "Girl, 1983," which challenges the conventions of memoir and autobiographical fiction. The book centers on a writer who attempts to reconstruct a painful memory from her adolescence involving a relationship with an older photographer, grappling with the gaps and absences in her recollection. The reviewer notes that Ullmann, daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, uses the novel form to explore the fluid nature of memory, suggesting that all autobiography is a form of fiction. The work is praised for its deft experimentation with genre and its profound meditation on how experiences persist.</p>
