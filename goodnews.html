          <p>Sinclair and Nexstar are reinstating "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC affiliate broadcast stations, effective Friday, following a temporary suspension that lasted nearly a week. The decision comes after both companies engaged in discussions with Disney and received extensive feedback from viewers, advertisers, and community leaders regarding comments made by the host. This incident sparked a broader debate over broadcasters' rights to exercise judgment on local content versus their obligations to air national network programming. Both Sinclair and Nexstar denied any government influence on their initial preemptions, despite prior FCC warnings that had raised questions about First Amendment protections and media independence.</p>

          <p>Dolly Fox, Charlie Sheen's ex-girlfriend, has corroborated a claim from Sheen's new memoir that then-Governor Bill Clinton showed interest in her during a 1987 visit to the Arkansas governor's mansion. Fox, whose mother was friends with Clinton's mother, described the moment as harmless flirting typical of the era, stating Clinton "was never creepy" towards her. This account offers a differing perspective from Sheen's memoir, which framed the incident with a "creepy" tone. Fox emphasizes her respect for the Clintons and her pride in Sheen's current efforts to take accountability for his past.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching $1.21 trillion, many Americans are seeking financial solutions like debt relief programs and credit counseling. Debt relief programs aim to reduce the total amount owed through strategies like debt settlement or consolidation, potentially offering faster resolution but carrying higher risks to credit scores. Conversely, credit counseling focuses on education, budgeting, and structured repayment plans over a longer period, generally with a milder impact on credit. Understanding costs, credit implications, and timelines is crucial for choosing the most suitable option to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Electronic Arts closed up 15% on Friday following reports that the video game company is nearing a roughly $50 billion deal to go private. Investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Silver Lake, are reportedly involved, with an announcement potentially coming as early as next week. This would mark the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history, surpassing a $45 billion deal in 2007. The move reflects PIF's substantial investment in the gaming sector, and if finalized, would take the maker of popular titles like The Sims and Madden NFL private. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent United Nations General Assembly was marked by a palpable sense of anxiety and apprehension among global health leaders, particularly following President Trump's significant cuts to foreign aid. Attendees observed a shift, with some noting a tendency for leaders to "talk in silos" about aid dependency, while others expressed enthusiasm for a new U.S. global health strategy that emphasizes private-sector involvement. Despite concerns over funding and potential future challenges, a collective energy emerged, focused on finding innovative, collaborative solutions to global health and development issues.</p>

          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, this article analyzes the monthly costs of a $20,000 home equity loan, highlighting its affordability compared to alternative borrowing options. For a 10-year loan at 8.34%, monthly payments are approximately $246.26, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% costs around $193.56. These rates show only marginal decreases from earlier in the year. Despite the muted impact of recent rate cuts, home equity loans offer fixed rates, the potential for future refinancing, and attractive tax advantages for eligible home repairs, making them a strategic borrowing option for homeowners.

          <p>Hip-hop producer Metro Boomin, whose legal name is Leland Tyler Wayne, has been found not liable in his civil sexual assault case after a federal jury sided with him following nearly a year of litigation. The Grammy-nominated artist expressed profound relief, stating he is grateful to put "this nonsense behind me." While the accuser's attorney plans to appeal the verdict, Wayne's legal team consistently maintained that the allegations were "frivolous and unequivocally false." The artist lamented the significant personal and professional toll the lawsuit had taken on him and his family.</p>

          <p>A rare orange lobster, affectionately nicknamed Jean-Clawed Van Damme, was successfully rescued from a New York supermarket and released back into the Long Island Sound. A keen-eyed shopper spotted the live, unusually colored crustacean—estimated to be a one-in-30-million find—among other lobsters for sale. The shopper purchased it and, with assistance from Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, ensured its safe return to the wild. This heartwarming event, occurring just before National Lobster Day, offered a unique contrast to the typical fate of thousands of lobsters during peak harvesting season.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Apsana Begum have been readmitted as Labour MPs, ending a year-long suspension for their rebellion against the party's stance on the two-child benefit cap. They were among seven left-wing MPs who voted with an SNP motion to abolish the cap, a policy Labour has recently softened its position on. Begum criticized the party for suspending members for voting their conscience, while the readmissions occur amid growing pressure on ministers to scrap the cap. Abolishing it would cost £3.5 billion and lift 470,000 children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their 12th division title in 13 years, but their celebration was marked by reflection on a challenging season plagued by injuries, slumps, and bullpen struggles. The article explores the concept of a "World Series hangover," noting the significant physical and mental toll of attempting to repeat as champions, a feat rarely accomplished in baseball. Despite the adversity and the need to navigate the wild card round, the team believes these struggles have made them "battle-tested" and better prepared for the postseason, aiming to maintain recent momentum for another championship run.</p>
