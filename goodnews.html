          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Lauren S√°nchez are celebrating their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of high-profile guests including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Oprah Winfrey. The lavish festivities have reportedly included multiple events ahead of the main ceremony. However, the influx of celebrities and the extravagant nature of the event have sparked protests from some Venice locals. A campaign called "No Space for Bezos" has emerged, aligning with broader European sentiment against over-tourism and its impact on local costs and housing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at $1.17 trillion, many households are exploring debt settlement as a relief option. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the total amount owed, but it becomes less effective for very large debts, typically over $100,000. For such high balances, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, and the fees for settlement companies can become prohibitively expensive. The article suggests that debt settlement works best for unsecured debts between $7,500 and $75,000, and outlines alternatives like consolidation loans, credit counseling, and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy.

          <p>A new book, "Toni at Random," sheds light on Toni Morrison's parallel career as a book editor at Random House in the 1970s, before she achieved global fame for her own fiction. During her time in publishing, Morrison championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali, pushing for their work to be published with integrity and without catering to white audiences. She believed that literature written for a specific community could still achieve universal appeal and greatness. This work reveals Morrison's commitment to creating a space for uncompromising Black voices within the mainstream literary world.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the Universal Service Fund, a federal program that subsidizes internet and phone services for rural, low-income, and other underserved communities. In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a challenge from conservative groups who argued that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its taxing power to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which administers the fund. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, affirmed that the delegation of authority to the FCC was constitutional. This ruling secures a key program aimed at bridging the digital divide and ensuring broad access to telecommunications services across the United States.</p>

          <p>A new trend of "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans, concerned about inflation, tariffs, and job security, are increasingly prioritizing saving over spending. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, reaching 4.5% in May, while social media trends like "no buy" challenges have gained popularity. This shift marks a reversal from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge, with consumers now focused on building emergency funds and cutting discretionary costs.

It detonated 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT and creating a sonic boom heard by residents below.
