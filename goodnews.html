          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford recently participated in an extensive passing workout, his first since being sidelined with a back issue. Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism, stating Stafford "looked good" and threw over 60 passes without apparent limitations, marking a significant step in his recovery. The 37-year-old veteran is dealing with an aggravated disc issue and is expected to gradually rejoin team practices. This positive development is a hopeful sign for the Rams as they prepare for the upcoming season, aiming to have their star quarterback back in action soon.</p>

          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game, star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing, was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting field official. Lamb was standing on the sideline in street clothes when the official, focused on the play, ran into his back, knocking him down. Although Lamb was uninjured and laughed off the incident, the Cowboys received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official. The unusual event occurred during the second quarter of the game against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams' 31-21 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys showcased the potential of their running back depth. Rookie Blake Corum made a strong case for a larger role, rushing for 32 yards and two touchdowns, suggesting he could help ease the workload on starter Kyren Williams. Other running backs, including Jarquez Hunter and Cody Schrader, also performed well, contributing to a robust ground attack. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, further demonstrating the team's offensive depth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "quiet luxury" trend of subtle, unbranded high-end fashion is giving way to a resurgence of "loud luxury," characterized by prominent logos and bold, statement designs. Major fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace are shifting their creative direction to inject novelty and reignite consumer interest after a period of slowing sales. This change comes as the luxury sector faces economic headwinds and consumer fatigue with pandemic-era price hikes. Analysts suggest this cyclical shift aims to recapture brand desirability and appeal to a broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

This meeting occurred just a day after President Trump announced a face-to-face summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled for August 15 in Alaska. The UK discussions are seen as a crucial step to align with allies ahead of the controversial U.S.-Russia meeting, which has raised concerns among Ukrainian officials.</p>

          <p>A dog named Petunia has been crowned the winner of this year's "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of unconventional-looking dogs and promotes animal adoption. Many of the contestants, including Petunia, are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills. Petunia and her owner, Shannon Nyman, received a $5,000 prize for winning the title, which honors the idea that a pet's value is not defined by its pedigree.</p>

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran's recent description of himself as "culturally Irish" has sparked a broader conversation about what it means to be Irish in 2025. The article explores how Irish identity is no longer a simple binary, especially for the diaspora in Britain and for those in Northern Ireland navigating post-conflict identities. Cultural Irishness is presented as a wide spectrum encompassing diverse influences from music and literature to a shared sense of humor and history. This evolving identity reflects a more fluid, globalized world where connections to heritage are personal and multifaceted.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% initial score on Rotten Tomatoes. However, the overwhelmingly negative reception has ironically generated interest, drawing viewers who are intrigued by "junk films" that are so bad they become entertaining. The article explores the appeal of such movies, contrasting them with forgettable, bland blockbusters. Experts and fans argue there is a certain charm in watching earnest but failed filmmaking, which can be more memorable and enjoyable than a polished but soulless production.</p>

          <p>The release of China's DeepSeek-R1 AI model six months ago sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, challenging the "bigger is better" philosophy of AI development. DeepSeek demonstrated that a highly capable model could be built with a fraction of the resources, prompting a shift toward developing smaller, more efficient AI. Despite security concerns about its Chinese origins, some U.S. startups continue to use the model to cut costs. The event marked a turning point in the U.S.-China AI rivalry, proving the competitiveness of China's tech sector and influencing subsequent strategies from major players.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House meeting where CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American parts and companies. During the meeting, Trump assured Cook that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating major investor concerns about the company's profitability. This successful political engagement provided a significant boost to the company's valuation. (not investment advice)</p>
