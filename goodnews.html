          <p>The U.S. stock market rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moving toward all-time highs, after a new report showed July inflation was slightly lower than anticipated. The consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year, below the 2.8% economists had forecast, fueling investor optimism for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Traders increased their bets on a rate cut to a 94% probability following the news. The positive data provides the Fed with more flexibility as it weighs its next move on monetary policy.

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is establishing a new team culture ahead of the season, characterized by inclusivity and a "glass half-full" mentality. In a notable early move, he invited all club staff, including catering and cleaning crews, to a first-team meeting to emphasize that everyone is part of the collective journey. Frank's approach is hands-on and detail-oriented, a departure from his predecessor's methods, and he demands open communication and hard work from his players. His leadership style is already being tested by injuries and the departure of key players during the pre-season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies on Wednesday. The call comes ahead of a high-stakes, in-person summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The discussion follows a previous phone call where, according to Zelenskyy, a White House adviser signaled that Russia may be ready to take initial steps toward a ceasefire. This pre-summit engagement is seen as a crucial effort to align with allies before direct talks with Russia about the ongoing war.</p>

This estimated increase is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The official COLA, which is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation, is calculated by the Social Security Administration using inflation data from July, August, and September. The final figure for 2026 will be announced in October after the next two months of inflation data are incorporated into the calculation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of support among registered city voters, compared to 25% for Cuomo and 7% for incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who are both running as independents. Mamdani's strength is concentrated among younger voters, while Cuomo performs better with Black and Jewish voters. The results signal a potential challenge for centrist Democrats, as top party leaders have yet to endorse Mamdani.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings on a $50,000 Deposit in a CD Versus a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and potentially higher, but variable, returns. A detailed comparison shows that for shorter terms (e.g., six months to one year), CDs with fixed rates currently offer slightly more interest. However, for longer terms, a high-yield savings account could earn more if its variable rate remains consistent. The article advises savers to weigh the security of a locked-in CD rate against the potential for higher earnings from a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been safely rescued after being lost for nine days in a remote, boggy region of British Columbia, Canada. The man, Andrew Barber, survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a shelter from sticks and moss. Demonstrating his will to survive, he carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which helped lead to his discovery. A search and rescue helicopter spotted his truck and later found him near his shelter, suffering from severe dehydration and a leg injury, but ultimately safe.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) held steady at 2.7% in July compared to a year earlier, with declines in grocery and gasoline prices helping to balance rising costs in other sectors. However, economists point to underlying signs that Trump administration policies on tariffs and immigration are beginning to stoke inflation, particularly for consumer goods like household furnishings. The "core" CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to a 3.1% annual rate, its fastest pace since February. Experts predict these inflationary pressures could become more pronounced later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance caused the company's shares to rise.

          <p>The Paraguayan government is proposing a new law that would encourage the local assembly of electronic goods using imported parts, largely from China. The plan, presented to lawmakers by economy ministers, aims to create jobs and diversify the nation's manufacturing base by allowing companies to shift from importing finished products to assembling components domestically. Officials argue that ongoing trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, create a strategic opportunity for Paraguay to become an attractive assembly hub. The proposal comes amid a growing political debate within Paraguay about its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus Beijing.</p>
