          <p>India is set to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens for the first time in five years, a move described by Beijing as positive and in the common interest of both nations. The Indian embassy in Beijing announced that applications would reopen, requiring an online form and an in-person appointment at visa centers. This development signals a potential thaw in diplomatic relations and a step towards normalizing people-to-people exchanges between the two countries. China's foreign ministry expressed readiness to continue communication with India to further facilitate these exchanges, marking a hopeful sign for bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. The court ruled their trials were unfair, a major vindication for the traders who argued their actions were standard commercial practice and they were scapegoated for the 2008 financial crisis. This decision follows the quashing of all similar convictions in the United States in 2022, leaving the UK as the only country where such activities had been criminalized. The ruling raises significant questions about the effectiveness of the criminal appeal system in England and Wales.</p>

          <h2>Effectiveness of 'Precooling' Homes to Save Energy Debated by Experts and Utilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heat waves intensify, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling"—significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours—is gaining attention, though its effectiveness is debated. Some power companies and researchers suggest it can work in efficient homes if thermostats are raised during peak energy-demand hours. However, others, like Exelon Corporation, warn it could be more expensive and strain air conditioning systems. Experts agree that basic efficiency measures like keeping windows and curtains closed are crucial. An alternative strategy involves concentrating cool air in specific areas of the home with fans or window units during the hottest parts of the day.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European automakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rallied significantly following the announcement of a major trade deal between the United States and Japan. The agreement, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, has sparked optimism that the European Union could secure a similar breakthrough in its own tariff negotiations with the U.S. The Stoxx Europe autos index saw its largest daily gain in months, reflecting market hopes for reduced trade tensions. However, analysts note that a potential EU deal may hinge on its willingness to match Japan's substantial investment commitments to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced that its southern island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs regime by the end of the year, a major step in its transformation into a global free-trade port. This new system will allow nearly 6,600 types of goods to enter Hainan with zero tariffs, a significant expansion from the current 21%. The initiative is a key component of China's "dual circulation" economic strategy, aimed at boosting domestic consumption and attracting international business and tourism. Goods processed on the island with over 30% added value can be sold to the mainland tariff-free, potentially creating a buffer in trade disputes.</p>

          <p>As sales of traditional alcoholic beverages falter, major producers like Constellation Brands and Pernod Ricard are exploring the rapidly growing market for cannabis-infused drinks. The boom is largely driven by beverages containing small amounts of THC derived from federally legal hemp, allowing them to be sold outside of licensed dispensaries. With the hemp-based drink market projected to exceed $1 billion this year, alcohol companies see a significant growth opportunity. Brewers like Molson Coors and Tilray Brands are already involved, aiming to capture market share from a new category that is increasingly stealing shelf space and consumer interest from beer and spirits.</p>

Since taking the role, he has already used his influence to address cultural issues in local schools and stated his priorities include addressing special educational needs, a subject personal to him due to his sister's condition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found strong evidence that a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, Catalhoyuk, was a society centered around women. DNA analysis of skeletons buried under homes revealed that related individuals were often connected through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. Further findings, such as more grave goods buried with women and evidence of child-swapping between families to ensure resource equality, point to a society with an elevated status for women and egalitarian values.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with deflationary pressures, prominent economists are arguing that the country's economic problems require deep institutional reforms rather than just short-term stimulus. Academics from Peking University and other institutions suggest that boosting "total factor productivity" through systemic changes is crucial for China's next five-year plan. They contend that improving the incentive structure for local officials—shifting focus from GDP growth to sustainable development—is key to solving issues like industrial overcapacity. While some near-term support may be needed, the long-term focus is on fostering high-quality growth through fundamental policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis considers what constitutes a "win" in the modern context of algorithm-driven social bubbles and widespread political polarization.
