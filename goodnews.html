          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her controversial remarks regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to constituents' concerns about Republican Medicaid cuts by sarcastically stating, "Well, we're all going to die." Scholten, who previously ran for Congress, aims to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly concerning Iowa soybean farmers affected by the trade war with China. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but significant campaign. The focus will be on healthcare and trade policy as key issues in the election. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reviewing safety protocols at Dodger Stadium after a Yankees fan was reportedly struck by a piece of falling concrete during a game. Ricardo Aquino, a fan from Mexico City, reported being hit in the back by a chunk of concrete roughly the size of a baseball. The Dodgers have since installed concrete netting in the affected area and initiated a comprehensive examination of the stadium's infrastructure. Dodger Stadium, built in 1962, underwent a major renovation project before the 2020 season, but the incident raises concerns about the aging structure. </p>

The new president will immediately be sworn in for a single, five-year term and will face challenges including a slowing economy, U.S. trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. The election is a defining moment for South Korea's democracy, though observers worry about a domestic divide worsened by Yoon's actions. </p>
