          <h2>Welsh Resident Faces Garden Loss Due to Road Upgrade Project</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>John Watkeys, a resident of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, has lost part of his garden due to the Heads of the Valleys road upgrade, a ¬£2 billion project aimed at improving transport and economic opportunities in the region. Despite the project's completion after 23 years, Watkeys and other residents are still dealing with the impact on their homes, including the loss of trees and increased stress. Watkeys, who has lived near the A465 for 65 years, had to rebuild his garden after construction caused dirt and dust accumulation, and he is still in discussions with the Welsh government regarding compensation. Another resident, Daryl Wilkins, claims that vibrations from the construction have caused cracks in his home, highlighting ongoing disputes between residents and authorities over the road's impact. The road has been a major disruption for the community, and while it has improved traffic flow, it has also created challenges for those living closest to it. The optimism score for this article reflects the balance between infrastructural progress and the personal costs to residents.</p>

          <p>FIFA is launching a new, expanded Club World Cup format in 2025, featuring 32 teams competing in the United States. The tournament aims to generate increased revenue and will be held every four years, with the FIFA Intercontinental Cup filling the intervening years. Teams will be divided into eight groups of four, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage, and the winner of the tournament will receive $40 million in prize money. However, the new format has received mixed reactions, with some critics pointing to the already overcrowded football calendar and potential scheduling conflicts with other tournaments, and ticket sales have been slow, indicating a lack of enthusiasm from fans.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a slide in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Food inflation hit 0.99% in May, significantly below April's 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been cutting interest rates to bolster economic growth, with economists predicting further cuts later in the year. India's economy expanded at 7.4% in the quarter ended March, and the RBI has maintained its growth projection for the current fiscal year at 6.5% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new generation of restaurateurs is embracing a more modest model, focusing on smaller, independent operations rather than large-scale replication, and these owner-operators prioritize a career defined by a local ZIP Code and personal connections with customers and employees. To improve their odds, these restaurants avoid high-rent spaces, run multiple operations out of a shared space, and work the room in person. However, the restaurant business faces numerous challenges, including changing consumer preferences, economic downturns, and the impact of ICE raids, and the presence of federal troops, which means employees and customers may not be showing up at restaurants at all.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember John Lee has broken his silence on a 2017 Las Vegas trip with his then-boss Mitch Englander, addressing allegations of ethics violations. Lee insists he paid for his share of the trip and did not accept improper gifts, while the Ethics Commission accuses him of accepting free hotel rooms, poker chips, and food in violation of city ethics laws. The trip led to an FBI investigation of Englander, who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators, and Lee's testimony sought to cast doubt on the allegations against him. The Ethics Commission will vote on whether violations occurred and what financial penalties, if any, should be.</p>

          <p>Local leaders are contrasting the current unrest in Los Angeles with the 1992 riots, emphasizing that the recent events are significantly more limited in scope and do not reflect the same level of citywide uprising. Unlike the 1992 riots, which followed the acquittal of officers involved in the Rodney King beating, the recent protests are localized and have not resulted in widespread violence or destruction. The response to the current situation also differs, with the federal government imposing its presence without the request of state officials, and the visuals they show on TV are exactly what the folks in Washington want to be seen.</p>
