          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, marking a return to form for the team. The race was overshadowed by a controversial decision from McLaren, who ordered Oscar Piastri to cede second place to his teammate Lando Norris. The order came after a slow pit stop for Norris, which had cost him the position he held for most of the race. While Piastri complied, he expressed his disagreement, sparking a debate about team strategy and fairness in the tight championship battle between the two McLaren drivers.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since her appointment, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett discussed her legal philosophy and new book. She pushed back against labels of the court shifting politically, stating she decides cases as they come without partisan considerations. Regarding the Dobbs decision, Barrett explained it returned the abortion issue to the democratic process within states, rather than making it illegal. She consistently declined to comment on pending legal questions about President Trump's executive authority, emphasizing the judicial need to approach cases with an open mind after reviewing all arguments.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister, has officially started her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, a departure from the usual unanimous approval, reportedly at Russia's request due to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. In her new role, Baerbock will chair meetings and manage discussions among the 193 member states, acting as a behind-the-scenes unifier and honest broker. The nomination by Germany's previous government was not without controversy, as some critics felt a more experienced career diplomat should have been chosen for the post.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Listening to the Law," Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult personal decision to accept the nomination to the Supreme Court. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy she and her family experienced during a previous consideration for a court seat. Barrett reveals that she and her husband agreed to "burn the boats," a commitment to forge ahead without looking back at their comfortable life in South Bend, Indiana. Despite her reluctance, she felt it would be cowardly to refuse public service and the opportunity to defend the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker completed a 12-hour, 26.4-mile ocean journey from Catalina Island to the California mainland in a kayak he grew entirely from mushrooms. The vessel was created using mycelium, the root network of fungi, cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. This journey marks the longest open-water crossing in such a craft, aiming to highlight mycelium-based materials as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker is part of a small but growing community exploring the potential of this sustainable technology, which produces a lightweight, buoyant, and durable material.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Economic Concerns Over New Tariff Rules May Be Overstated</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 10:00:22 EDT</div>

          <p>An economic analysis suggests that while the Trump administration's elimination of the 'de minimis' tariff loophole will impact some small businesses, the broader panic may be misdirected. The rule, which affects imported goods valued under $800, primarily targets a fraction of the nation's small businesses, as the majority are service-based and do not rely on international goods. The author argues that the economy's ability to absorb the resulting price increases depends more on larger factors like employment and income levels. Therefore, overall economic health, which remains relatively strong, is a more critical indicator to watch than this specific policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles have been eliminated from the Rugby World Cup despite a dominant 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England was enough for them to advance to the quarter-finals on points differential, knocking the American team out of the tournament. While disappointed, the team is looking toward the future with hope, largely due to the standout performances of its younger players. Stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna and 19-year-old full-back Sariah Ibarra showcased exceptional talent, suggesting a bright future for the program heading into the next World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development, and are linked to better concentration and emotional regulation in older children. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He stresses that while routines are helpful, flexibility is key to reducing parental stress and responding to a baby's individual needs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that solar power should be embraced by right-wing preppers and survivalists due to its inherent alignment with principles of self-reliance and independence. Unlike fossil fuels, which depend on complex, vulnerable supply chains, solar energy provides a decentralized and long-lasting power source directly from the sun. The author contends that a home equipped with solar panels and battery storage becomes a truly self-sufficient castle, capable of powering a house and electric vehicles indefinitely without reliance on external grids or fuel supplies. This makes it an ideal energy solution for anyone concerned with societal collapse or emergency preparedness.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed reports about his relationship with his former NFL team, the New England Patriots, confirming that he has banned their scouts from attending UNC practices. He stated that since he feels he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, indicating a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's recent expansion of coal power capacity is not a reversal of its climate policy but a strategic move to support its massive renewable energy rollout. Despite adding record amounts of solar power, China faces challenges with grid stability and energy curtailment, where clean power is generated but cannot be used. Droughts have also reduced hydropower output. In this context, new coal plants act as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring the lights stay on during peak demand and giving grid operators the confidence to continue integrating unprecedented levels of wind and solar energy.</p>

          <p>The online marketplace Vinted, now a billion-dollar company, began with a common problem: too many clothes. In 2008, co-founder Milda Mitkutė needed to downsize her wardrobe before moving and, with friend Justas Janauskas, created a simple website to sell her unwanted items. The concept quickly gained popularity through word of mouth, expanding from Lithuania to Germany and beyond. Despite a near-disastrous period in 2016 after introducing a commission fee, the company recovered by scrapping the fee and investing in advertising. In 2019, Vinted became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, championing the second-hand clothing market.</p>
