          <p>Friday's UK newspapers feature a mix of stories, prominently including the looming vote on the assisted dying bill. The Daily Express leads with a supporter's plea for choice in having a good death, featuring a photograph of Sophie Blake, who has incurable breast cancer. The Daily Telegraph reports on Labour MPs' last-minute plea to reject the bill, which returns to the Commons after controversies. Other stories include the absence of the Princess of Wales at Royal Ascot and Donald Trump's deadline regarding the Middle East conflict, alongside weather warnings for the heatwave. The overall tone of the news is balanced, presenting both sides of the assisted dying debate and highlighting other significant events.</p>

          <p>China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet again, leading to hopes of improved relations after years of tension. The pilgrimages, which involve treks to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, are significant for multiple religions. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 being allowed to travel along two routes between June and August. Some experts believe these pilgrimages can positively influence China-India relations during times of crisis, offering a path toward stability.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court extended its block of a judge's order directing President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Newsom. The court sided with the president, allowing the continued deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles to protect federal property and U.S. immigration agents. The judges determined that the president likely acted within his statutory authority under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents. The court also stated that the Trump administration was not required to seek Newsom's permission to call up the Guard.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following recent monetary easing measures and a trade agreement with the U.S. easing growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has reduced trade war fears, allowing Beijing some flexibility in supporting its currency. Analysts suggest that Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>
