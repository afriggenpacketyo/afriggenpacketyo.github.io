          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago. The redesign aims to expedite flights, reduce delays, and decrease aviation's impact on climate change. These changes could allow planes to ascend more quickly during takeoff and descend more smoothly. The government plans for UKADS to be fully operational by the end of the year, marking the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s. A community aviation group has warned that the plans could result in new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in early 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazism. Despite the danger she faced as a brown-skinned and gay woman during the rise of Hitler, she refused to leave Germany and instead provided financial support, letters of recommendation, and immigration guarantees to help Jewish individuals and families relocate to Britain. She hosted refugees at her home in Buckinghamshire and advocated for those interned as "enemy aliens". Her efforts, largely unacknowledged during her lifetime, are now being recognized, with a Kensington Palace exhibition planned to highlight her and her sisters' acts of resistance.</p>

          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic*, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and individual achievements, influence a person's life trajectory. Research suggests that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. The article discusses how siblings can act as mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, and how their influence can lead individuals to pursue different paths. The author reflects on her own experiences with her siblings and the impact they have had on her life, noting that being known for both best and worst traits is a beautiful thing.</p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is nominated to become the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. The position is primarily ceremonial, involving organizing plenary sessions. Baerbock's nomination has faced some criticism, as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the role. Baerbock's tenure as foreign minister was marked by outspokenness on human rights and democratic freedoms, but also by challenging international crises and a high travel rate, but she showed herself a strong supporter of sending military supplies to Ukraine.</p>

While foreign stars tend to play in Japan on short-term contracts, Mo'unga arrived during his prime on a three-year deal. Head coach Todd Blackadder highlighted the joint leadership provided by Mo'unga and Leitch as the bedrock for Brave Lupus's success, with Leitch praising Mo'unga's embrace of life in Fuchu and his performance on the field.</p>
