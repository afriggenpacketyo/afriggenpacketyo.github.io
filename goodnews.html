          <p>A job applicant shared their experience of being accidentally CC'd on an internal email containing the interviewer's private thoughts and to-do list after a Zoom interview. The feedback noted the candidate "lacked enthusiasm and energy" and had a "more subdued" communication style. Despite this, the applicant was invited for a second, in-person interview, creating a dilemma about whether to acknowledge the email or adjust their personality. The story prompted a wider online discussion, with others sharing similar experiences of receiving unintended feedback, highlighting issues of professionalism and bias in hiring processes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with increasing public awareness, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking poses health risks like cancer and depression. Experts suggest that evolving scientific consensus, social trends like "Dry January," and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives are contributing factors. The poll also highlighted a significant drop in drinking among women compared to men, reflecting complex social and behavioral norms.</p>

          <h2>Viral Photos of 'Zombie-Rabbits' in Colorado Explained by Wildlife Officials</h2>

          <p>Photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like facial growths have gone viral, sparking alarm online. However, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are not "zombies" but are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus. The disease, spread by ticks and fleas, causes keratinous tumors that are usually harmless unless they impede eating or vision. The virus is not transmissible to humans or other pets and is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope." The growths typically disappear once the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, experienced record flooding after a glacial basin near the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive "outburst flood." The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, threatening nearly 1,000 structures and prompting some evacuations. However, newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, largely held, preventing a catastrophic event and minimizing damage. The annual flooding, a consequence of a retreating glacier due to climate change, has now receded, and officials have reopened evacuated areas as they begin to assess the impact.</p>

          <p>A new survey shows that over half of business travelers have had loved ones join them on work trips, a trend often called "bleisure." The practice is even more common among C-suite executives, with many bringing partners, children, and friends along. For travelers, it's a way to save money on personal travel and reclaim family time that would otherwise be lost. While many companies quietly accept the practice as long as work is completed and expenses are kept separate, some employees remain hesitant to broadcast their plans for fear of appearing unprofessional.</p>
