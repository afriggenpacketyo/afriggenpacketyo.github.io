          <p>Team Europe has secured a commanding 11.5 to 4.5 lead over the United States after the second day of the Ryder Cup, marking their largest-ever lead heading into the final day's singles matches. The European team's performance was dominant, requiring only two and a half more points from the remaining 12 contests to retain the trophy. The day was also marked by a contentious atmosphere, with reports of thuggish and personal insults from the American galleries directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite the hostility, Europe's golfers maintained their composure and excelled on the course.</p>

          <p>In a new book, retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the court's decisive "swing vote." Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of political discourse in America, stating that democracy is not guaranteed to survive. He provides insight into his landmark decisions, including his majority opinion legalizing same-sex marriage, which he says was influenced by the legal hardships faced by children of gay parents. A devout Catholic, Kennedy also explains his internal conflict over abortion, ultimately concluding that his personal moral views could not dictate his constitutional judgment.</p>

          <p>Scotland's Anthony McGill has reached his first snooker final in eight years after a 6-3 victory over four-time world champion John Higgins at the British Open. McGill, who had fallen to 57th in the world rankings, won four consecutive frames to secure the win against his highly-ranked compatriot. The victory guarantees his return to the top 50 and sets up a final clash with England's Shaun Murphy. Murphy advanced to the final after a dominant 6-1 win over defending champion Mark Selby, ending his own 26-month drought without reaching a ranking title match.</p>

          <p>St Helens snatched a stunning 16-14 victory against the Leeds Rhinos with a try scored by Shane Wright after the final hooter in a Super League play-off eliminator. In a frantic final play, the ball moved across the pitch through 16 passes before Wright touched down to seal the win. The dramatic finish came after Leeds had controlled long periods of the second half but failed to capitalize, leaving them vulnerable. The victory was particularly remarkable as St Helens played the second half with a reduced bench after forward Matty Lees left at halftime for the birth of his child.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as a cornerstone of its economic growth strategy. A taskforce has identified twelve potential locations, with sites in Bedfordshire, Leeds, and north London being the most promising. Labour aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, with these new developments collectively providing up to 300,000 homes over the coming decades. The plan involves establishing development corporations with special planning powers, modeled after the successful regeneration of Stratford for the 2012 Olympics, to expedite the building process.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based company Fading West is championing modular home construction as a viable method to address the nationwide housing shortage and affordability crisis. By manufacturing homes in a factory setting, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and construction time by half compared to traditional on-site building. This approach has already been utilized for disaster relief, providing 82 homes for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. Proponents argue that this manufacturing model offers a more sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective way to build, potentially making homeownership more accessible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the company and its vast supply chain as a cyberattack continues to halt vehicle production. The manufacturer, owned by India's Tata Motors, has been shut down for weeks since being targeted by hackers at the end of August, raising fears that smaller suppliers could face bankruptcy. The loan guarantee is intended to provide financial certainty, protect thousands of jobs, and help JLR manage payments to its suppliers during the prolonged disruption. The shutdown is reportedly costing JLR at least £50 million per week.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought against him by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement are confidential, concluding a legal battle that began in 2021 after Giuliani, acting as a lawyer for Donald Trump, promoted baseless conspiracy theories about the company's voting machines. This resolution follows Dominion's nearly $800 million settlement with Fox News for similar claims. The lawsuit was one of several significant legal and financial challenges Giuliani has faced for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
