          <h2>Trump Indicates Agreement Reached on TikTok's Future</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 09:49:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that his administration has reached an agreement concerning TikTok, expressing confidence that young users in the U.S. will be pleased. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent corroborated this, describing it as a "framework" deal between private entities with agreed commercial terms, which will be finalized during an upcoming discussion between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development unfolds as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a looming September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. business or be effectively banned, a measure Congress passed due to national security concerns over Chinese data collection. Trump has previously issued executive orders to delay enforcement of the ban, seeking a resolution that would see TikTok's U.S. operations owned primarily by American investors.</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports to Semiannual Basis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 09:46:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly proposed that companies cease quarterly earnings reports, advocating for a shift to semiannual reporting instead, pending SEC approval. He argued this change would reduce costs and enable corporate managers to prioritize long-term strategic planning over short-term financial targets, drawing a comparison to China's perceived long-term business outlook. The idea aligns with previous suggestions from prominent business leaders, including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized quarterly guidance for fostering an unhealthy focus on immediate profits. While current U.S. regulations require quarterly reports for transparency, this proposal would bring the U.S. more in line with practices in the U.K. and EU, where semiannual reporting is standard.

          <p>Tesla's stock saw a notable increase after CEO Elon Musk revealed a substantial open-market purchase of 2.57 million shares, totaling around $1 billion, marking his first such acquisition since early 2020. This significant insider investment is widely perceived as a strong affirmation of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future, leading to an approximate 6% rise in share prices. The purchase occurs as the company prepares for a shareholder vote on a new, highly ambitious pay package for Musk, which could be valued at up to $975 billion if aggressive market capitalization targets are met. Despite this positive signal, Tesla's shares have been affected this year by declining sales, partially linked to Musk's political engagements and a more competitive EV landscape.

          <p>A recent Natixis Investment Managers survey reveals that 21% of Americans believe it will "take a miracle" to achieve a secure retirement, despite a recent uptick in S&P 500 performance. Top concerns include insufficient savings, inflation eroding assets, and potential cuts to government benefits. Financial experts, however, contend that a structured plan, rather than a miracle, is the key to retirement security. They advise starting early, maintaining consistency, and regularly reviewing one's plan without emotional reactions to market fluctuations. Utilizing planning tools and consulting financial advisors can help navigate complex factors like inflation and longevity, providing clarity and confidence for future retirees.

          <p>While a significant number of job seekers, around 65%, utilize AI in their application process, career experts caution against blindly trusting these tools, highlighting common mistakes that could harm employment chances. Key issues include AI's propensity to "hallucinate" or invent details, potentially leading to inaccurate or exaggerated work experience on resumes. Furthermore, AI-generated applications often share a similar structure and keyword-stuffing, making it challenging for candidates to differentiate themselves. Experts recommend that job seekers write their own resumes and cover letters first, then use AI for refining language and proofreading, emphasizing the critical need for human oversight to ensure accuracy and maintain an authentic voice that resonates with employers.</p>

          <p>The article provides an overview of current mortgage and refinance interest rates, noting the challenges faced by homebuyers and those looking to refinance due to elevated rates and limited housing supply. As of September 11, 2025, national average rates for a 15-year mortgage stood at 5.71% and 6.53% for a 30-year mortgage, with refinance rates slightly higher at 6.00% and 6.72% respectively. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could offer some relief to borrowers. To secure the best rates, individuals are advised to improve their credit scores, aiming for the mid-to-high 700s, and to thoroughly compare offers from various lenders. Understanding loan terms, associated fees, and calculating affordable monthly payments are emphasized as critical steps before committing to a new loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article outlines current interest rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, presenting them as viable borrowing options for homeowners in the prevailing high-interest rate environment. As of September 11, 2025, average home equity loan rates varied from 8.23% for a 5-year term to 8.38% for a 10-year term, while the average HELOC rate stood at 8.10%. It distinguishes between the two: home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, whereas HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving credit line. Both utilize home equity as collateral and may offer tax benefits for qualifying home improvements, but borrowers must carefully assess the risks, including potential foreclosure, to align with their financial goals.

          <p>Isadore Hall, a former state legislator and Compton City Council member, has launched a campaign to challenge Los Angeles City Controller Kenneth Mejia, who is seeking re-election. Hall, backed by prominent endorsers, criticizes Mejia for focusing on "social media theatrics" over fiscal accountability, citing his own extensive experience in public office and expertise in combating government waste. The race is shaping up as a clash between L.A.'s political establishment, represented by Hall, and the city's ascendant left, which propelled Mejia to office in 2022 with an unorthodox, social media-driven campaign. This contest will test whether the political pendulum has shifted since Mejia's upset victory, as both candidates bring different political styles and past controversies to the forefront.</p>

          <p>Manchester City achieved a commanding 3-0 victory over Manchester United in the recent derby, leading to a detailed tactical analysis of the match's turning points. Pep Guardiola's strategy effectively exploited vulnerabilities in United's defensive setup, particularly by concentrating attacks on the left side and creating numerical advantages in midfield. A crucial element was left-back Nico O'Reilly's wide positioning, which pulled United's right wing-back out of position, enabling winger Jeremy Doku to drift inside and link up with teammates. United's pressing was often disorganized, and defensive miscommunications were evident, allowing City to control the game. This outcome raises questions about manager Ruben Amorim's tactical philosophy and his perceived unwillingness to adjust his system despite recurring issues.</p>

Sze, who initially harbored doubts about accepting the role given the current upheaval, ultimately embraced the opportunity to "give something back to poetry."
