          <h2>Pentagon Accelerates Investment in Domestic Critical Minerals to Reduce Reliance on China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 14:44:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is increasing efforts to secure a domestic supply of critical minerals, aiming to counter China's market dominance. As part of this initiative, the Defense Department recently acquired a direct equity stake in MP Materials, the operator of the only U.S. rare earth mine. This public-private partnership model is seen as a new strategy to onshore vital supply chains for national security, particularly for materials used in advanced military technology like F-35 fighter jets and drones. The move is part of a broader $540 million investment to strengthen the U.S. industrial base for these essential resources.</p>

          <p>A transgender woman from Mexico, seeking asylum in the U.S., has been released from an ICE detention facility in Washington. Her release follows an order from a federal judge in Oregon, who ruled that she had been deprived of liberty without due process. The woman, who had been detained for over 40 days, originally fled to the U.S. after being sexually assaulted by cartel members due to her gender identity. Her attorneys stated that she has now been reunited with her family while her asylum case proceeds.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Emmy nominations revealed several key trends, with Apple TV+ shows "Severance" and "The Studio" leading in drama and comedy nominations, respectively. The success of these shows, along with "The White Lotus," underscores a pattern of rewarding productions with large, well-regarded ensemble casts. The streaming landscape continues to evolve, with Apple TV+, Max, and Disney+ solidifying their positions as major contenders alongside Netflix. While there were celebrated first-time nominees like Harrison Ford, some popular shows and actors were notably snubbed, sparking debate among viewers and critics.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the United States. According to the announcement, the deal would grant the U.S. tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant change from previous trade relations. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has reportedly committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, are expressing support for President Trump's recent shift toward a tougher stance on Russia. The senators, who have been advocating for strict sanctions, are now willing to give the president's new approach—which includes threatening 100% tariffs—time to work before pushing their own legislation. They view the president's actions as a "game changer" that provides a new tool for pressuring Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. This development signals a potential alignment between Congress and the White House on Russia policy after a period of differing strategies.</p>
