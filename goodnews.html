        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed has provided five key tips for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental phase for many children. She advises letting children have autonomy over their food choices, avoiding the practice of labeling foods as "good" or "bad," and focusing on making mealtimes an enjoyable social experience. Additional strategies include being mindful of a child's naturally fluctuating appetite and involving them in food preparation to build familiarity and encourage acceptance of new foods.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is presented as a joyful response to a difficult personal period, incorporating Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements into his sound. The article notes collaborations with Indian artists and the use of instruments like the sitar and tabla, reflecting Sheeran's recent tour experiences in India. However, the review suggests that while these influences add new textures, many tracks ultimately retreat to his familiar, commercially successful pop formula, missing an opportunity for a more adventurous artistic direction.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, exceeding its initial range and valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion. The offering experienced high demand, allowing the company to sell fewer shares than originally marketed to raise its target of $425 million. This IPO is considered a significant test for the crypto market's health, particularly as Gemini has reported widening financial losses despite its growing platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service is examining Denmark's highly successful approach to cancer care, which has dramatically improved patient survival rates over the last two decades. Denmark transformed its system through significant investments in diagnostic technology like CT scanners, the implementation of strict targets for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and a focus on improving the overall patient experience. Analysts believe that for the UK to replicate this success, it would require sustained political consensus, long-term investment, and clearer accountability within the NHS.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that it was unconstitutional and discriminatory to prevent husbands from taking their wives' last names. The court declared the old law a "colonial import" that violated gender equality, pointing out that in many traditional African cultures, women historically retained their birth names after marriage. The government has been given two years to amend the legislation, a decision celebrated as progressive but also met with criticism from some traditionalists online.</p>

          <p>Recent substantial gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are testing the ability of regulators to manage a stable and sustainable bull market, rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle. Beijing's goal is to encourage a steady market that can shift household wealth from property to equities, which would in turn help boost consumer spending and support overall economic growth. Following a recent pullback that slightly tempered the rally, analysts now suggest the market is entering a more measured "slow bull" phase. (not investment advice)</p>

The purchase was made in collaboration with the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11, which secured an agreement to rehire all 25 union employees who were laid off when the diner closed. The restaurant, famous for its 24-hour service, was abruptly shuttered by its previous owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, following a labor dispute earlier in the year.</p>
