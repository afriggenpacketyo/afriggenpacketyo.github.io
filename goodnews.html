          <p>The UK government is considering expanding its ban on destructive bottom trawling practices across a larger area of its waters to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible damage to the oceans. The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The move follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life, aligning with international efforts to protect ocean biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv will stage Sir Frederick Ashton's "La Fille mal gard√©e," a celebrated English ballet, after boycotting classic Russian repertoire. This decision follows the Ukrainian government's request for cultural institutions to avoid productions by Russian composers and choreographers due to the ongoing conflict. Fundraising efforts in London, led by Ivan Putrov and Antony Gormley, made the production possible, with Jean-Pierre Gasquet waiving his fee. The performance aims to uplift spirits and showcase Ukraine's commitment to preserving its cultural identity amidst the war.</p>

          <p>A contractor in Maarat al-Numan, Syria, discovered an ancient Byzantine tomb complex dating back over 1,500 years while clearing rubble from a destroyed house. The site includes two burial chambers, each containing six stone tombs, with a cross etched into one stone column. The discovery adds to the region's rich collection of archaeological sites, which hold a third of Syria's monuments. Residents hope the new government will fairly compensate property owners and assist displaced people returning to rebuild their homes, viewing the ruins as a potential source of economic renewal.</p>
