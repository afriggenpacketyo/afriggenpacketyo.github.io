          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Iran have agreed to a "complete and total" ceasefire, intended to end the recent conflict, although an Iranian official offered a less definitive statement. According to Trump's timeline, both sides would cease strikes within specific timeframes, leading to an official end to the conflict. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested that Iran had already halted strikes but made no formal agreement on a ceasefire. The White House maintained that both sides agreed, contingent on no further Iranian attacks, with Qatar playing a role in brokering the deal after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks. Optimism score is not being used in the summary.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran may have led to a ceasefire, with White House officials claiming a diplomatic breakthrough. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development, reports suggest a halt in attacks following Iran's promise to retaliate for a U.S. strike. Iran stated it would cease attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, and Israeli attacks reportedly ceased as the deadline arrived in Tehran. The situation developed after Iran followed through on its promise to retaliate for a prior U.S. strike, with no American casualties or damage reported.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are congratulating President Trump on the Iran-Israel ceasefire, while Democrats are withholding their applause, following news that Iran and Israel have reached a ceasefire after the United States struck Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. Republicans praised Trump's negotiating prowess, with some suggesting he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Democrats, however, expressed concern over Trump's admission of unilaterally bringing the United States into a war without congressional approval, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling it illegal and unconstitutional. Rep. Thomas Massie said he would not push for a resolution requiring Trump to gain congressional approval before attacking Iran if the ceasefire holds.</p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV tests to women who have delayed coming forward for cervical screening, starting in January. The DIY test kits contain a cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV). This initiative aims to tackle barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, lack of time, and cultural concerns that prevent women from attending cervical screening appointments. A recent trial showed that home test kits could increase the proportion screened to 77% over three years.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Says Iran Unlikely to Close Strait of Hormuz</h2>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, because it would harm its own economy. Braziel noted that Iran exports 1.7 million barrels a day through the strait, and closing it would remove its oil from the market, raising prices but making U.S. exports more valuable. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products. (not investment advice)</p>
