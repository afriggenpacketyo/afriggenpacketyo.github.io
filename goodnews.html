          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a faster increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth, even amidst ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, cumulative profits at major industrial firms rose by 3% compared to the previous year, an acceleration from March's 2.6% growth, and high-tech manufacturing saw particular gains. Despite U.S. tariffs, Chinese exports have managed to find alternative markets, and a recent trade truce has led to a reduction in levies between the two nations. However, some sectors, like automobiles and apparel, continue to face challenges due to price competition and demand shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer months, aiming to mitigate the impact of inflation. This measure is part of a broader relief package designed to counter the economic fallout from U.S. tariffs, including levies on the automotive industry. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills significantly during the peak summer months, and the government has earmarked funds for electricity, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas. Some critics view the subsidies as an attempt to bolster support for the government ahead of upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>
