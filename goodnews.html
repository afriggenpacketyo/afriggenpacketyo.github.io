          <h2>China Urges Officials to Temper Austerity Drive in Dining</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese Communist Party publications are calling on local governments to carefully implement austerity measures related to official dining, aiming to ease the impact on the food and beverage industry. Concerns arose after some local governments excessively scrutinized meal gatherings and canceled official receptions, causing disruptions to the catering sector. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, clarified that the frugality drive targets extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. This adjustment follows the release of regulations aimed at curbing excess in official meals, including bans on high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at government events, reflecting a need for balance between austerity and economic stability. The current situation is a call to be more thoughtful about austerity. The author's tone is neutral.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres culminated in a benches-clearing incident during the final game of their series, resulting in the ejections of both managers. The incident was sparked when Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit by a pitch, leading to a heated confrontation between Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and Padres manager Mike Shildt. Despite the scuffle, the game continued, with further drama as Shohei Ohtani was also hit by a pitch, leading to another ejection and a near comeback by the Dodgers that ultimately fell short. The Padres secured a 5-3 victory, concluding a heated two-week stretch of rivalry baseball between the two teams. The tone is neutral.</p>

          <p>Experts are urging for increased vision screenings in schools to detect lazy eyes early, as many children are being missed for treatment due to limited availability of such services. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society advocates for universal screening in schools across England, aligning with practices in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before age seven, are crucial for correcting amblyopia, the medical term for lazy eye. Parents are encouraged to seek regular eye tests for their children, regardless of whether school screenings are available, to ensure timely intervention and prevent potential long-term vision problems. The general tone is hopeful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating, tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, effectively delayed rot by almost a week or more, at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new preservation strategy is as effective as existing methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The coating is eco-friendly and has universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits. The overall tone is optimistic.</p>

The 25-year-old, who won a bronze medal at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, revealed her plans at the opening ceremony for a new skating rink in her hometown. Sakamoto expressed that she feels she has less than a year left in her competitive career, as she will be 29 at the following Olympics, making it unlikely for her to continue. She made her Olympic debut at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and has won four straight Japanese championships. The tone is sentimental.</p>

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws" is celebrated, recent shark attacks are grabbing headlines, prompting discussions about shark conservation. While shark attacks have occurred, experts say the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions, rather than an increase in shark populations. Shark Angels, a conservation group, aims to transform fear into fascination and promote education to dispel myths about sharks. Endurance athlete Lewis Pugh is swimming 62 miles around Martha‚Äôs Vineyard to raise awareness of the need to protect sharks and change public perception. The tone is positive.</p>

          <p>China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following recent monetary easing measures and a trade deal with the U.S. that has eased some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. This has allowed some breathing space for Beijing to support its currency and raise hopes that any hit to the economy will be smaller than previously expected. (not investment advice)</p>
