        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record $6.1 billion, marking the largest sale price ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. This sale surpasses previous records, including the Washington Commanders and Phoenix Suns, highlighting the escalating value of major sports franchises. The former ownership group, which purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million, oversaw two NBA championships.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has ruled that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a version by US composer Jonathan Wright, concluding a six-year legal dispute. The court affirmed that Wright's 2011 interpretation lacked sufficient originality to be considered a distinct copyrighted work, as it was based on a public domain folk song. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation achieved phenomenal viral success, becoming one of YouTube's most-viewed videos. This landmark decision clarifies copyright protection standards for popular arrangements derived from traditional works, affirming the original song's public domain status.</p>

          <p>This article showcases four individuals who achieved their dream jobs without attending university, offering inspiration as exam results are released. Their stories, ranging from a zookeeper at Chester Zoo to a celebrity photographer for Harry Styles, a film assistant producer, and a self-employed nail technician, demonstrate that success is attainable through alternative routes like apprenticeships and self-taught skills. They emphasize the importance of not rushing into decisions and pursuing passions, even if it means taking a "normal job" to fund them. The article suggests that practical experience can often outweigh formal academic qualifications.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 01:21:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains BTecs, which are practical vocational qualifications equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2) or A-levels (Level 3), assessed through coursework, exams, and projects. They serve as a pathway to university or direct employment, with health and social care and applied science being popular subjects. Recent government plans to streamline post-16 education initially threatened BTec funding to make way for T-levels, but the Labour government has paused and reversed many of these cuts for "key courses." This ensures that a broader range of vocational pathways remains available for students, acknowledging their importance in various sectors.</p>

          <p>Voltify, a startup founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, is aiming to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. rail industry by converting diesel locomotives to rechargeable batteries. Their "VoltCars" are sodium-ion batteries designed to connect to existing freight trains, potentially saving companies billions in fuel costs and reducing emissions. Despite initial skepticism from the traditional industry regarding charging time and reliability, Voltify has developed an algorithm to forecast energy demands and is building solar-powered microgrids. The company is in active talks with major railroads and plans pilot projects, alongside other firms also developing battery-electric train solutions.</p>

          <p>A TravelPerk survey reveals that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones on work trips, a trend known as "bleisure" travel. Motivations include reclaiming family time, avoiding loneliness, and significant cost savings by leveraging company-covered travel expenses for personal leisure. While not always disclosed to employers, many companies quietly permit it as long as business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. This blending of professional and personal travel, valued at $315 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032, indicating a substantial shift in corporate travel norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a record low in US alcohol consumption, with only 54% of Americans reporting they drink, a level not seen since 1958. This decline is largely attributed to increased public knowledge about the health risks of alcohol, even in moderation, a significant shift in scientific understanding. Younger generations, specifically those aged 18-34, are particularly influenced, showing lower consumption rates and greater belief in alcohol's harm. Societal changes, such as the growing acceptance of sobriety and the rising cost of alcohol, are also contributing factors to this evolving trend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings regarding mousse-form sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop!, raising concerns about their efficacy in blocking harmful UV rays. A major safety concern is their packaging, which often resembles whipped cream containers, posing a risk of accidental ingestion. The FDA sent warning letters to several companies, stating that these products are classified as drugs but lack the necessary FDA approval and are "misbranded" due to their deceptive food-like appearance. Companies have 15 days to address these identified violations.</p>

While visa-free travel for Vanuatu citizens was discussed, it will be addressed in a separate, unconfirmed subsidiary agreement. This deal follows similar security pacts Australia has recently forged with other Pacific neighbors.</p>
