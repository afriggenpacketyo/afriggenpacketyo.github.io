        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysts, China is on the verge of placing another large aircraft order with European manufacturer Airbus, potentially for 100 to 200 new jets. This move would further sideline U.S. rival Boeing, which has not secured a major order from China since 2017 amid ongoing trade tensions and safety concerns. The potential deal underscores a strategic shift in China's procurement, leaving some Boeing-reliant Chinese airlines in a difficult position for fleet renewal.</p>

          <p>A new biography examines the career of Claire McCardell, an influential American fashion designer who revolutionized women's clothing in the mid-20th century. McCardell championed comfort and practicality, introducing now-commonplace items like ballet flats, separates, and dresses with pockets. The article explores her innovative design philosophy, which focused on freeing women from restrictive attire, and questions why her once-household name has largely been forgotten despite her enduring impact on fashion.</p>
