          <h2>China to Release Film on Japanese Biological Warfare Unit Amid Bilateral Concerns</h2>

          <p>China plans to release a movie this summer about the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731, a notorious unit believed to have conducted covert biological and chemical warfare research in China during World War II. The film, produced in cooperation with an exhibition hall dedicated to the unit, is set to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Film director Zhao Linshan aims to evoke sympathy and highlight the unit's cruel history, while a Japanese government source expressed concern that the film could rekindle historical tensions and negatively impact bilateral relations. The Japanese government maintains that it has not confirmed evidence to indicate the unit's human experiments.</p>

          <h2>China Implements Broad Policy Measures to Boost Economy Amid Trade Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade worries. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. These moves signal a greater urgency to stabilize the economy and alleviate depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan, but some analysts suggest their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited. The government is also preparing additional measures to support small and medium enterprises and the private sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morocco's role as a connector country, with its free-trade agreement with the European Union and growing economic ties with China, has become precarious amid the ongoing trade war. Chinese companies are increasingly investing in Morocco's automotive sector to circumvent tariffs, making the country a crucial conduit for exports to Europe. However, rising tensions between China and the West create a difficult balancing act for Morocco, where economic and geopolitical concerns do not always align. The Trump administration could pressure Morocco to take a stance against China, potentially threatening its economic development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland, once a staunchly pro-American country, is facing new anxieties about its security due to President Trump's threats to abandon European security commitments and Russia's aggression in Ukraine. In response, Poland is taking a leadership role in the European Union, increasing military spending, and organizing civil defense training for citizens. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has even suggested the possibility of Europe developing its own nuclear arsenal, signaling a potential shift away from reliance on the American nuclear umbrella. Poland's location on NATO's eastern edge makes it a crucial bulwark against Russian encroachment, underscoring the importance of its security measures.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has taken significant policy steps to mitigate the impact of the trade war with the United States, including cutting interest rates and easing lending restrictions for banks. The move, intended to stabilize markets, comes shortly after the announcement that top officials from the Trump administration will meet with Chinese counterparts for trade talks. These measures aim to keep the economy moving and encourage spending, but the standoff between the two countries has already brought global trade to its knees, jeopardizing the outlook for the world's largest economies.</p>

          <p>Criminals who refuse to attend sentencing in England and Wales could face an additional two years in prison, under a new bill to be introduced to Parliament. The bill aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice and provides additional powers for judges to punish those absent from sentencing. The families of murder victims, who have campaigned for changes to the law, view the development as a step in the right direction, indicating that this change is being taken seriously. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>

          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades will be included in the federally funded debris removal program, offering hope to residents facing uncertainty about the community's future. The decision follows weeks of limbo after the Jan. 7 Palisades fire destroyed nearly all of the park's 158 homes. The federal assistance is crucial, as the cost of debris removal is a major factor in determining whether to rebuild the park. Los Angeles County officials requested the inclusion, citing immediate threats to public health and safety due to the presence of friable asbestos on the property.</p>

The growth in tourism contrasts with tepid retail sales, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. China has also expanded its visa-free policies to attract foreign tourists, contributing to a rise in inbound travel. This article does not contain investment advice.</p>

China's Commerce Ministry said Vice Premier He Lifeng, who oversees economic matters, will meet with Bessent during his trip to Switzerland from Friday to Monday. But the ministry warned China's position of defending its own development interests, international fairness and the global trade order has been consistent.</p>
