          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in the city. The piece was quickly covered by authorities, citing the building's listed status, while police investigate the incident as criminal damage. Banksy authenticated the work via an Instagram post, continuing his tradition of creating politically charged and critical public art.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court dismissed Trump's claims of presidential immunity, finding no grounds to reconsider its previous holding on the matter and stating the damages were fair. This ruling pertains to defamatory statements Trump made in 2019 denying Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The decision follows a separate $5 million verdict against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation in a related lawsuit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are advising individuals who have lost their jobs on how to manage their student loan debt. Options for federal loan borrowers include enrolling in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, potentially to zero, based on current income like unemployment benefits. Borrowers may also qualify for deferment or forbearance to temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue. Those with private loans have fewer options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the primary factors that lenders consider when determining the terms of a personal loan offer, which many consumers use to consolidate high-interest debt. A strong credit score and history are paramount, as higher scores typically secure lower interest rates. Lenders also assess an applicant's debt-to-income ratio to ensure they can afford new payments, with a ratio below 35% being preferable. Other significant factors include the loan amount, the repayment term length, employment stability, and any existing relationship with the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler made his first award-show appearance since a vocal cord injury forced his band to retire from touring. At the MTV Video Music Awards, Tyler joined other musicians for an emotional tribute performance of "Mama, I'm Coming Home" to honor the late Ozzy Osbourne. In August 2024, Aerosmith announced their retirement from the road after over 50 years, stating that a full recovery from Tyler's larynx injury was not possible. The tribute was well-received by fans, who praised the powerful performance.</p>

His appointment follows the court-ordered removal of his predecessor and was secured with support from the opposition People's Party.
