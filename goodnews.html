          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to buy Google's Chrome browser, a figure exceeding its own valuation but reportedly backed by investors. The offer comes as Google faces pressure from a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling that suggested the company should divest Chrome to level the playing field for search competitors. This move follows Perplexity's recent launch of its own AI-powered browser and a previous, unsuccessful proposal to merge with TikTok, highlighting the startup's aggressive strategy in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Chino police have recovered $30,000 worth of stolen Labubu monster figurines from a home in Upland, California, as part of a burglary investigation. The highly sought-after collectibles were stolen from a local warehouse, and police discovered an operation at the home to resell and ship the items nationwide. The immense popularity of the Chinese-based Pop Mart toys has led to a recent string of heists in the region, with limited-edition versions of the furry monsters fetching high prices on the black market and at auction.</p>

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but don't need the cash for living expenses, financial advisors suggest several smart options. One strategy is to reinvest the proceeds into a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to manage yearly tax bills. Alternatively, charitably inclined individuals can use a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) to satisfy their RMD while avoiding an increase in their adjusted gross income, and others can use the funds for legacy planning by contributing to a 529 college savings plan.

Parker affirms that she is likely the "common denominator" but advises against restraining critical instincts in the workplace, humorously suggesting that team-wide inadequacies are a standard condition of office life and that it's always a good time to "throw in the towel."</p>

CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the strong performance and positive market sentiment to a growing understanding of how stablecoins and blockchains are fundamentally changing the financial system, with interest from major financial institutions surging since the passage of supportive U.S. crypto legislation.

          <p>For retirees seeking financial security, annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, but their safety in the current economic climate depends on several factors. This article advises that potential investors should first verify the financial strength and credit rating of the issuing insurance company, as annuities are not FDIC-insured. It is also important to understand the limits of state guarantee associations, the different risk profiles of fixed versus variable annuities, and the long-term threat that inflation poses to the purchasing power of fixed payments.
