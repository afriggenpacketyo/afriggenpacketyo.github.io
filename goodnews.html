          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's partially state-owned Zijin Mining, saw its shares surge over 60% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The company raised nearly 25 billion Hong Kong dollars (about $3.2 billion), making it the world's second-largest initial public offering this year. This successful listing follows a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market and occurs as spot gold prices have reached record highs, driven by safe-haven demand, anticipated rate cuts, and global economic uncertainty. Major investors included Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and BlackRock Funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong should serve as China's primary gateway to the United Nations, advocating for the city to host the UN's Asia headquarters. The author argues this move would aid UN reforms and align with Beijing's vision for global governance, leveraging Hong Kong's unique attributes like its common law system, English as an official language, and low corporate taxes. Positioning Hong Kong in this role could enhance China's engagement with the UN, where it is the second-largest donor.

          <p>The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is nearing inauguration, poised to significantly alleviate congestion at India's financial capital, Mumbai. The current airport operates beyond its 55 million passenger capacity, with NMIA designed to eventually handle 90 million annually. This sprawling new facility, connected to Mumbai by India's longest sea-bridge, aims to become the country's first fully digital airport and a major international hub. Despite its advanced features and partnerships with leading airlines, the article highlights challenges, including its distance from the city and the need for improved last-mile connectivity and regulatory reforms to compete with global hubs like Singapore and Dubai.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump after his account was banned following the January 6 Capitol riot. Of the settlement, $22 million will be allocated to a trust for Washington D.C.'s National Mall and the construction of a White House ballroom, with the remainder going to other parties. This marks the third tech firm, after Meta and X (formerly Twitter), to settle with Trump over perceived online muzzling. While Google declined to comment on the reasons, the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability, and Trump's YouTube account was reinstated in 2023.</p>

          <p>"The White Lotus" star Aimee Lou Wood expressed no regret about publicly criticizing a "Saturday Night Live" sketch that mocked her teeth. The actress, 31, stated that speaking out broke a personal pattern of embarrassment she experienced when bullied in her youth. The SNL skit, which aired in April, depicted Wood with exaggerated features for a fluoride joke, drawing criticism for being "mean and unfunny." Wood confirmed that show bosses apologized for the sketch. This article also touches on her new BBC romantic-comedy drama "Film Club," which explores themes of loneliness, love, and mental health.</p>

          <p>LeBron James, entering his record-breaking 23rd NBA season, expressed uncertainty about his retirement plans during Lakers media day. The 40-year-old superstar, who will turn 41 in December, acknowledged that the end of his career is "a lot sooner than later" but remains deeply invested in the game. James exercised his player option for the current season, making him a free agent next summer if he doesn't retire or sign an extension. He emphasized that his decision will be a personal one, made with his wife and daughter, independent of teammates like Luka Doncic. Teammates, however, see no decline in his performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a looming government shutdown will have a minimal impact on the stock market, citing historical data that shows mixed market reactions to past shutdowns. His primary concern is the potential delay in releasing key economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Cramer differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, assuring that U.S. bondholders will still be paid. While acknowledging the shutdown would hurt furloughed federal workers and potentially reduce GDP growth, he suggests that delayed data collection, though an inconvenience for the Fed, is not a reason for major market concern.

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to curb its strategic non-ferrous metals sector, projecting a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary metals this year. The focus shifts from sheer production volume to optimizing industrial structure, aiming for an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output. The plan also prioritizes advances in the exploration of critical metals like copper, lithium, and nickel, alongside developing ultra-pure materials and enhancing recycling efforts. This move addresses cutthroat competition and depressed processing fees that have squeezed smelter margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey shared that he maintained limited conversations with his mother, Kay, for approximately eight years due to her tendency to share personal details with the media.

McConaughey explained that he eventually felt secure enough in his fame to allow his mother to speak freely, even encouraging her to tell "raunchiest stories."

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is reportedly exploring the development of stealthy flying-wing aircraft, potentially including a version of the B-21 Raider, to serve as "arsenal planes" armed with dozens of air-to-air missiles. This concept aims to supplement or replace Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones in high-intensity conflicts, particularly against China in the Indo-Pacific. These arsenal planes would provide significant "magazine depth" for crewed fighters, launching long-range missiles at targets designated by other aircraft.
