          <p>OpenAI is developing an AI-powered jobs platform and expanding its OpenAI Academy with new certification programs, aiming to connect skilled candidates with companies and enhance AI literacy. This strategic move could position OpenAI as a direct competitor to Microsoft's LinkedIn in the talent acquisition and online learning markets, despite Microsoft being a significant investor in the AI startup. The company plans to launch the platform by mid-2026 and aims to certify 10 million Americans in various AI fluency levels by 2030, directly addressing labor market concerns about AI's impact by fostering new economic opportunities and upskilling the workforce. This initiative also aligns with the White House's broader efforts to expand AI literacy nationwide.</p>

The National Development and Reform Commission reported that China's new drugs and R&D pipelines collectively account for over 30% of the global total, demonstrating robust growth. In 2024, a five-year high of 93 new drugs were approved, and medical device patent applications surpassed 91,500, representing 70% of the worldwide total. An "insights system" has also been implemented to aggregate data across the entire R&D, approval, and market chain, aiming to identify opportunities and overcome bottlenecks in the pursuit of drug innovation.</p>

Mora started for Mexico in their Concacaf Gold Cup final victory, showcasing remarkable confidence and personality. He previously became Club Tijuana's youngest player and goalscorer in Liga MX, and is now widely anticipated to play a central role in the 2026 World Cup. Despite growing rumors of interest from top European clubs like Real Madrid, the grounded teenager's primary target remains achieving a significant impact on the global stage.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Friday, extending gains as investors keenly await a crucial U.S. jobs report, which is expected to significantly shape expectations for an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The regional Stoxx 600 index recorded a 0.25% increase, primarily boosted by mining stocks. In corporate news, Danish wind farm developer Orsted's shares declined by 2% after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, attributing the change to lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its portfolio. This development coincides with Orsted's efforts to secure approval for a substantial $9.4 billion rights issue and its legal challenge against the Trump administration regarding a blocked U.S. offshore wind farm project.

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ordered a lower court to rehear a case concerning the state's controversial Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0) policy. This policy drastically reduced compensation for solar panel owners sending surplus electricity to the grid, causing an average increase of $63 in monthly utility bills and an estimated $20,000 loss over a solar array's normal lifespan. Critics, including the California Solar & Storage Association, assert that utilities perceive customer solar and storage as a threat to their profit motives and ability to expand the grid. A potential reevaluation of NEM 3.0 could better support California's ambitious goal of transitioning entirely to less polluting energy sources by 2045, making solar power more economically viable for homeowners.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees millennials and Gen Zers acquiring small businesses through "search funds," an investment vehicle where individuals raise capital from investors to buy and operate existing private companies. This model presents a lower-risk path to entrepreneurship compared to launching startups, as it leverages established customer bases, revenue, and product-market fit. With over half of all U.S. small businesses owned by retiring baby boomers lacking succession plans, search funds are effectively addressing a looming economic crisis while revitalizing Main Street. The article highlights the model's compelling returns and the crucial mentorship provided by investors, offering a practical and supported route for aspiring CEOs to build wealth and pursue entrepreneurial dreams.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that "fairly substantial" tariffs will soon be imposed on semiconductor imports from companies that do not relocate their production to the United States. Speaking at a White House dinner with prominent tech leaders, Trump indicated that firms like Apple, which have already pledged significant domestic manufacturing investments, would likely be exempt from these new levies. Apple, for instance, previously committed an additional $100 billion to U.S. manufacturing initiatives. This policy aims to accelerate the reshoring of the semiconductor supply chain, with major global firms such as TSMC and Samsung already investing hundreds of billions in U.S. plants. While the precise details of the tariffs and exemptions remain somewhat unclear, the announcement reinforces the administration's strong push for domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Facebook's parent company, Meta, alleging his account has been repeatedly suspended due to false accusations of "impersonating a celebrity." The lawyer claims these five shutdowns over the past eight years have cost him thousands of dollars in lost business, despite his repeated efforts to provide multiple forms of identification to prove his authentic name. He highlights the irony that he has been practicing law for 38 years, a period longer than the Facebook founder has been alive. Meta has since reinstated his account and stated it is working to prevent future errors, acknowledging the unusual and frustrating mix-up for the attorney.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million. This unprecedented climb marks the 42nd consecutive drawing without a top prize winner, establishing a new record. The article meticulously details how both federal and state taxes significantly impact a winner's ultimate take-home amount. States such as California, Florida, and Texas do not levy state taxes on lottery prizes, enabling winners there to receive over $1 billion (annuity option) or $485 million (lump sum) after federal taxes. Conversely, states with higher income taxes, like New York and Minnesota, result in considerably lower net payouts for jackpot winners. (not investment advice)</p>
