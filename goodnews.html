          <p>Investing in gold is not about following a strict schedule but rather viewing it as a crucial portfolio component. Experts suggest gold should comprise no more than 10% of an investment portfolio, varying based on the investor's profile. It's generally advisable to invest sooner rather than later, given gold's tendency to increase in value over time, despite minor fluctuations. For existing investors, re-evaluating the timeline for rebuilding gold investments may be necessary, especially after selling for profit. (not investment advice)</p>

McLaren's Oscar Piastri acknowledged the changes as a good step forward, particularly regarding abuse of officials, but felt some areas were too harsh.</p>

Coinbase has hired a law firm to assist with its response, stating that the SEC's inquiry is a holdover from the prior administration.

          <p>A mass crash on stage six of the Giro d'Italia forced several riders to withdraw, including former Giro champion Jai Hindley, as Mads Pedersen retained the pink leader's jersey. Kaden Groves won the stage in Naples after organisers neutralised the general classification battle due to the crash. Pedersen was also involved in the crash but was able to continue. The stage was neutralised for about 20km before resuming, with the peloton arriving in Naples for the final sprint.</p>
