          <p>Gold and Bitcoin have both reached record prices, with gold surpassing $3,900 per ounce and Bitcoin exceeding $125,000. This surge is attributed to investor uncertainty driven by factors like the U.S. government shutdown, global geopolitical conflicts, and concerns over the U.S. dollar's stability. Both assets are being treated as "safe havens," attracting institutional investors through ETFs for gold and benefiting from a pro-crypto political environment for Bitcoin. Analysts suggest these trends may continue, with central banks and hedge funds increasing their holdings in these alternative assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a major partnership with chipmaker AMD, agreeing to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's GPUs over several years. As part of the deal, OpenAI has been issued a warrant that could allow it to acquire up to a 10% stake in AMD, contingent on deployment milestones. The news caused AMD's stock to surge over 30%, positioning it as a key competitor to Nvidia in the AI hardware market. This strategic alliance aims to diversify OpenAI's hardware supply chain and supports its ambitious infrastructure expansion, including the Stargate project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi have jointly won the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine for their foundational discoveries in peripheral immune tolerance. Their research identified regulatory T-cells and the controlling Foxp3 gene, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This work has opened a new field of immunology and is pivotal for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of cancer. The trio will share the prize money of nearly $1.2 million, marking the first of the annual Nobel announcements.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation. Current national average yields are around 1.99% for a one-year term, but top online banks offer significantly higher rates, with some six-month CDs reaching 4.45% APY. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, savers are advised to explore online banks, which have lower overhead, and consider laddering CDs of various terms to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings goals.

Military experts emphasize that unmanned systems are transforming modern battlefields, making drone literacy and a comprehensive national strategy essential for India's defense.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs represent an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans and credit cards. As of early October 2025, the average interest rate for a 15-year home equity loan is 8.24%, while the average HELOC rate is 7.89%. These products offer lower rates because the home serves as collateral, and the interest paid may be tax-deductible if used for eligible home improvements.

Jones advises that while there is an opportunity to capture substantial gains, investors must be nimble, as the end of such a rally is typically severe.

          <p>During the CBS broadcast of the Denver Broncos' victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, former quarterback and current commentator Tony Romo voiced sharp criticism of the officiating. Romo questioned at least two significant calls, including an offensive pass interference penalty he deemed incorrect and an intentional grounding flag that was later picked up after a replay assist. His commentary on the officials' decisions, particularly his frustration with their lack of communication on the overturned call, drew attention from NFL fans. The game concluded with a controversial no-call on potential interference, which further fueled debate about the quality of the refereeing.</p>

The play follows a modern-day Chicago teen who finds himself transported back to 1864, exploring themes of historical repetition and the search for identity. The Mascogo community formed a unique Afro-Mexican culture, and their history reflects a broader struggle for recognition and survival.

The book functions less as a writing manual and more as a guide to discovering books through serendipity and personal connection, rather than algorithms or shrinking critical coverage. Davis shares her own reading journey, moving between diverse authors and finding unexpected pleasures in books she might not have chosen herself. The work champions a more organic and intimate relationship with literature, where reading and writing are part of a continuous, reciprocal conversation.</p>
