          <p>Venezuelan pro-democracy leader Maria Corina Machado expressed that receiving the Nobel Peace Prize signifies to her compatriots that "we are not alone" in their struggle against the country's authoritarian regime. Machado, known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," has challenged the government for over two decades and has been forced into hiding due to threats of arrest. She believes the award offers protection and globally spotlights Venezuela's fight for freedom. The article notes her gratitude to President Trump for his administration's pressure on the Maduro regime.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, voluntarily returned its state championship trophy after their coach discovered a scoring error. Following a buzzer-beater win, coach Brendan King reviewed game tape and realized his team had actually lost by one point. Despite league rules preventing score changes post-game, the team unanimously decided to appeal their own victory, leading to the championship being awarded to Apache High. This act of integrity was praised by the opposing coach, who noted it restored faith in human kindness.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horse, has retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a runaway incident in central London last year. The horse was one of five spooked by construction noise, leading to riders being thrown and animals colliding with vehicles. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, requiring surgery, and was deemed unable to return to duty, unlike the other four horses. The Horse Trust, which provides permanent homes for former military horses, will now care for Quaker, emphasizing the importance of animal welfare.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire key talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, whose leadership has informed employees of the pending transaction. Prompt AI, founded in 2023, developed the Seemour app, enhancing home security cameras with sophisticated detection capabilities, though its business model proved unsustainable. This "acqui-hire" reflects a broader trend among Silicon Valley giants to bolster AI research and development. The deal is expected to integrate Prompt's innovations into Apple's HomeKit smart home division, despite Apple's historical preference for smaller acquisitions.</p>
