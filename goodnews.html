          <p>Anze Kopitar, the long-serving captain of the Los Angeles Kings, has announced he will retire at the conclusion of the 2025-26 NHL season. Considered the franchise's greatest player, Kopitar led the team to two Stanley Cup victories in 2012 and 2014. He is currently entering his 20th season and is on the verge of breaking the team's all-time scoring record, needing just 30 more points to surpass Marcel Dionne. His decorated career includes two Selke trophies for best defensive forward and three Lady Byng trophies for gentlemanly play.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has completed a deal valued at over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other key employees, as well as to license the AI hardware startup's technology. This transaction, structured as a talent and technology acquisition rather than a full purchase, allows Nvidia to integrate Enfabrica's solutions for connecting massive clusters of GPUs. Enfabrica, which specializes in networking technology that can link over 100,000 GPUs, had previously received investment from Nvidia and its competitor AMD, highlighting its strategic importance in the AI infrastructure landscape.

          <p>A bipartisan amendment requiring more congressional oversight of the U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking has been unanimously passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Sarah McBride, directs the State Department to report on the impact of recent staff reductions at its anti-trafficking office. This action follows a Guardian investigation revealing that the Trump administration had significantly scaled back these efforts, including a 70% workforce reduction and a failure to publish a legally mandated annual report on global human trafficking.</p>

The incident caused a brief delay but did not significantly disrupt the president's departure schedule following his diplomatic talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
