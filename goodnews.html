          <p>As AI usage increases, researchers are uncovering more cases of harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. This is compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Researchers advocate for red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to uncover potential harm. They recommend adopting standardized AI flaw reports and incentives to improve risk evaluation and governance, drawing from successful practices in software security.</p>

          <h2>Phrases to Avoid and Use for Better Communication with Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can hinder cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so" or "Stop crying" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries can foster cooperation. Examples include explaining decisions, giving agency over meeting boundaries, and validating emotions, which can lead to emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for eligible patients with strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage resources and GP workload. The medicine, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, promotes weight loss by reducing appetite. Pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand may outstrip supply, and some GP practices are warning ineligible patients not to book appointments.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist recently released from ICE detention, returned to Columbia University to reaffirm his commitment to Palestinian freedom. He criticized Columbia for attempting to suppress pro-Palestinian speech and accused them of funding the killing in Gaza. Khalil plans to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, despite facing potential threats. He was detained for over 100 days before a federal judge ruled his detention unconstitutional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This success is attributed to long-term government planning, vast subsidies, and dominance in battery production. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. This has resulted in a thriving EV start-up sector and the world's largest public charging network.</p>
