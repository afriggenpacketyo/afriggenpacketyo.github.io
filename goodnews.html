          <p>An article explores why India struggles to produce top-tier footballers despite its dominance in cricket. While cricket boasts young stars and a well-structured system, football lacks role models and a clear pathway for talent development. Experts emphasize the need for grassroots investment, better infrastructure, and more games for young players. The Indian Super League (ISL) lags behind the Indian Premier League (IPL) in terms of revenue and commercial success, hindering clubs' ability to invest in player development. There is hope that identifying and nurturing young talent could elevate Indian football on the global stage.</p>

Some cities, like Tallinn, Estonia, have implemented free public transport, but results have been mixed, with ridership falling and car use increasing. Behavioral scientists emphasize the psychological aspects of car ownership, including status, pride, and comfort. Successful public transport systems, like TransJakarta, prioritize safety, comfort, and reliability. Cities are also exploring disincentives for car ownership, such as levies and congestion charges, and redesigning urban spaces to favor public transport.</p>
