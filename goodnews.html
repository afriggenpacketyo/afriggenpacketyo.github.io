          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 22:12:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from numerous "sanctuary" cities and counties across the U.S., including major hubs like Los Angeles and Chicago. This ruling expands on an earlier decision that deemed the President's attempt to freeze funds for local governments limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement unconstitutional. The decision supports dozens of cities that joined the lawsuit, affirming their right to set local policies without federal financial coercion. This ongoing legal battle highlights significant tensions between federal and local authorities regarding immigration enforcement and municipal autonomy, with the court asserting a significant check on executive power in this complex and politically charged area of law.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has announced a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move aimed at developing its domestic downstream industries. This decision positions Malaysia as a potential alternative supplier for the United States, which is actively seeking non-Chinese sources for these critical raw materials used extensively in electronic hardware. Analysts suggest Malaysia's existing processing capabilities provide it with a significant head start in integrating into global supply chains. The ban signals Malaysia's intent to prioritize its own economic development and leverage its geoeconomic agency, potentially attracting substantial foreign investment in its processed rare earths sector.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the preferred venue for Chinese companies seeking Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), surpassing the United States for the first eight months of 2025. This shift marks a significant milestone for Hong Kong's capital market, with 46 Chinese firms raising $16.5 billion in the city, compared to 16 listings in the US totaling $740.9 million. The trend is attributed to Hong Kong's more active market, where new shares have seen an average 19.4% jump on debut, and lingering risks of delisting for Chinese stocks in the US due to regulatory uncertainties. The growing rivalry between China and the US has evidently redirected capital flows back to Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

Gor will also serve as a special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs, overseeing relations that have recently been strained by trade disputes, including planned US tariffs on Indian goods. Trump expressed full trust in Gor to advance his agenda and "Make America Great Again" in the region, highlighting the importance of the role for the world's most populous area. This appointment comes as bilateral trade between Washington and New Delhi exceeds $190 billion annually, making the ambassador's role crucial for navigating complex diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing a second court battle against Hannah Robinson, a woman it pursued for thousands in parking charges. The firm was widely criticized for its "five-minute payment rule," which was later banned by the private parking sector, but continued to pursue charges incurred prior to the ban. Robinson, who initially paid some fees, was eventually asked for £11,390 for 67 unpaid notices, which she fought with free legal aid. The judge dismissed Excel's claims, finding their conduct "unreasonable and out of the norm," and awarded costs to the Access to Justice Foundation, setting a precedent against predatory practices.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) has achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell's comments, hinting at potential interest rate adjustments with policy already in "restrictive territory," triggered a "panicked repositioning" in the market, leading to significant short liquidations for ETH. This surge reflects renewed momentum and perceived alignment between the administration and the Fed on easing monetary policy. Ether has recently emerged as a crypto market leader, buoyed by regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, many of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean cafes, particularly in student-heavy areas, are grappling with the "Cagongjok" phenomenon, where customers, mostly young people, occupy seats for extended periods to study or work. This includes elaborate setups with multiple devices and power strips, leading to issues like monopolized seating and disruption for other patrons. Starbucks Korea recently issued guidelines to curb "extreme cases," while independent cafes employ varied approaches, from "No Study Zone" policies to time limits. Experts attribute this trend to South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a lack of public study spaces, highlighting a need for more inclusive environments that accommodate this cultural practice without inconveniencing others.</p>

          <p>The Consulate General of India has leased a full floor in downtown Los Angeles' AON Center, marking its second office in California and signaling expanded cooperation with the region. This move comes as Southern California prepares to host major global events like the 2028 Olympics and parts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, anticipating a surge in Indian tourism and educational interest. The new diplomatic presence is considered crucial for the over half-million Indian Americans in Southern California and for facilitating trade and cultural connections, despite recent US tariffs on Indian goods. The lease is a positive development for downtown LA's office market amid high vacancy rates.</p>

The accompanying wristband, developed by Meta's CTRL Labs, utilizes sEMG sensor technology to interpret hand movements, a key input for future AR devices. Meta aims to court developers for experimental AI apps, despite setting low sales expectations due to the glasses' increased components and weight.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, restructuring its broadcasting landscape. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night and wild-card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million. ESPN is obtaining a new package, including MLB TV's digital out-of-market games and in-market games for five local teams, valued at $550 million. These three-year deals mean all major rights expire after the 2028 season, positioning MLB to potentially attract more bidders and increase its reach, despite not fully recouping previous losses from ESPN's early exit.
