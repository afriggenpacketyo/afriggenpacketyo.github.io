          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections on June 3, leading to Kim denouncing the move as a "political coup". Following a vote by PPP members, Kim was reinstated, thanking supporters and pledging to lead South Korea towards becoming a greater nation. The PPP has faced turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, with the opposition candidate currently leading in the polls.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for Europe to import more American meat, arguing that American production methods are superior, but European officials are resisting due to strict EU food regulations, including a ban on hormones. This New York Times article explains how European policymakers view their food safety standards as a ‚Äúred line‚Äù in trade negotiations. While the EU may be willing to make other concessions to avert a trade war, they are unlikely to compromise on health and safety standards for agricultural products, reflecting a preference for smaller family farms and traditional farming practices.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in flight missions. Published in Science Robotics, the breakthrough involves high-risk maneuvers that require unstable postures, transforming them into high-survival rewards. This technology could redefine traditional drone flight paradigms, drawing inspiration from the aerial acrobatics of birds and bats. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University notes that this biological wisdom is key to redefining drone flight.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler based in Bedfordshire, advocates for the measurable health benefits of human touch, including boosted serotonin and oxytocin levels and reduced cortisol. This BBC article details how she hosts "cuddle puddles" and offers one-to-one cuddle therapy to clients seeking comfort and connection. While the practice may raise eyebrows, Wood emphasizes that it is a platonic and nurturing service with strict boundaries and consent protocols. Experts highlight the importance of feeling safe and familiar with those involved in touch for it to be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are finding success in China's lower-tier cities, offsetting challenges posed by sluggish consumption and intense price competition. This South China Morning Post article explains how Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transactions, indicating a strategic effort to defend market share. The growth in coffee shops is largely concentrated in second and ‚Äúnew first-tier cities,‚Äù suggesting a shift in focus beyond the wealthier urban centers. While competition remains fierce, the expansion into smaller cities provides new opportunities for these coffee chains.</p>

          <h2>Japan Reluctant to Embrace App-Based Salary Payments Despite Cashless Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 21:30:18 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction. This Kyodo News article explains how only a small percentage of workers are paid via apps, with many citing a lack of perceived benefits. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment method, experts believe greater incentives and wider availability to part-time workers are needed to increase adoption. Despite resistance to app-based payments, cashless transactions in Japan have surpassed 40 percent of all settlements, achieving the government's target ahead of schedule.</p>
