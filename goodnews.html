          <p>Amazon announced plans to extend its same-day or next-day delivery services to over 4,000 smaller cities, towns, and rural communities in the United States by the end of the year, marking the first time these areas will have access to such rapid delivery options. This initiative is part of a larger $4 billion investment aimed at tripling the size of Amazon's rural delivery network by the end of 2026, enhancing accessibility and convenience for customers in underserved regions. The expansion reflects Amazon's ongoing efforts to improve its logistics infrastructure and reach a broader customer base, potentially boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty in these areas.

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance, aiming to reassure allies amid concerns about Washington's potential withdrawal due to uneven defense spending.

The summit in The Hague is taking place against the backdrop of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, with members agreeing to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035.

          <p>Savings accounts are a wise idea to save money now for expenses you may face in the future. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.38% as of June 24, 2025, according to the latest numbers available from the FDIC. You can earn exponentially more than that by opening a high-yield savings account, however. Bankrate reports that top high-yield savings account rates for June 2025 are between 4.11% and 4.30%.</p>

          <p>Gold has for centuries been an attractive commodity. Not only is the precious metal viewed as a form of currency, but it's considered an attractive investment commodity as well. As of June 24, 2025, the price of gold is $3,310.42 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold. While that figure represents the market's assessment of the precious metal's current value, it's important to note that gold prices are subject to constant fluctuations due to a variety of factors.
