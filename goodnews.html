          <p>Following a 2024 law mandating its sale, a deal has reportedly been structured to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under new ownership. The plan involves creating a new US-based company controlled by a group of American investors, including tech giant Oracle and allies of President Trump. This new entity would license TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, but would retrain it using only US user data to mitigate national security concerns. The deal, which President Trump claims has been approved by China's President Xi Jinping, aims to resolve a years-long geopolitical standoff.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is gathering strength in the Atlantic and is expected to become a hurricane as it moves away from the Bahamas and the southeastern United States. The storm's forecast track takes it towards Bermuda, which is now under a hurricane watch. While the immediate threat to the US mainland is low, swells generated by Imelda are likely to cause life-threatening surf and dangerous rip current conditions along much of the East Coast. As of early Tuesday, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, just shy of hurricane status.</p>

          <h2>YouTube Agrees to $24.5 Million Settlement with Donald Trump Over Account Suspension</h2>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump after the platform suspended his account following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. This agreement follows similar multi-million dollar settlements Trump reached with Meta and X (formerly Twitter) after they also suspended his accounts. The filing notes that the settlement is not an admission of liability by YouTube. The move has drawn criticism from some Democratic senators, who previously expressed concern that such a settlement could be part of a quid-pro-quo arrangement to avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>According to sources close to the negotiations, Hamas and other Palestinian factions are leaning toward accepting a 20-point peace plan proposed by President Trump to end the war in Gaza. The proposal reportedly includes a swift ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a significant increase in humanitarian aid, and the establishment of an interim technocratic administration. The plan has already garnered public support from the Palestinian Authority and a joint statement of encouragement from several key Muslim-majority nations, signaling a potential diplomatic breakthrough in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <h2>Symbolic Recognition of Palestinian Statehood Challenges Israeli Political Narratives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the recent wave of countries formally recognizing a Palestinian state, while largely symbolic, serves as a powerful diplomatic counter-move to the agenda of Israel's far-right. These declarations directly challenge the narrative that a two-state solution can be permanently foreclosed by the expansion of settlements. The article suggests that this international consensus-building sets the stage for future conflicts with Israel's government over the possibility of Palestinian sovereignty. It posits that the two-state solution cannot be killed by "facts on the ground" if the international community refuses to accept them.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, the president of Princeton University challenges the widely held belief that current college students are fragile "snowflakes" who are hostile to free speech. Based on his direct interactions, he contends that most students are eager for constructive debate and that the few instances of campus disruptions are rare exceptions that receive disproportionate media attention. He argues that advocacy groups often use flawed polling metrics and that the media has an incentive to promote stories of "cancel culture," creating a distorted public perception of the reality on university campuses today.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now downgraded to a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the United States but continues to pose a threat to coastal areas. The National Hurricane Center warns that the storm is likely to cause dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast, as well as in the Bahamas and Bermuda, over the next several days. Although the storm is forecast to continue weakening and become an extratropical system, its large size and power mean its effects will be felt far from its center, requiring continued caution from beachgoers and mariners.</p>

          <p>Drawing from her personal collapse from exhaustion in 2007, Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is on a mission to dismantle the "collective delusion" that burnout is necessary for success. She argues that scientific data proves people are more effective and creative when they allow themselves time to recharge. Instead of drastic resolutions, she advocates for adopting "micro steps"—small, daily, incremental changes that gradually build into healthier habits. This approach, she contends, helps individuals avoid burnout while improving their leadership abilities and overall well-being, ultimately leading to more sustainable success.</p>

The 42-year-old Hearts player, who has been capped 81 times, returns to the international stage for the first time since recovering from a neck injury that has kept him out of action since May. His inclusion is a notable change in coach Steve Clarke's selection, which also sees a few other players dropped from the previous squad.

The rapid construction of bungalow classrooms by the Los Angeles Unified School District marks a significant step in the community's recovery. However, the school faces challenges, as its enrollment has plummeted by 58%, with many families having relocated after losing their homes. The return is a moment of celebration for some, but it also highlights the profound and lasting disruption the fire has caused to the community.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his new book, "The Future of Truth," legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog reflects on his lifelong artistic quest for what he calls "ecstatic truth." He explores the paradox of living in an information-rich age where consensual truth seems increasingly unreachable, distorted by fake news, political mythmaking, and the nature of the internet. Herzog discusses how societies and individuals often have a deep-seated yearning to be misled, and he shares his surprisingly reserved perspective on the rise of artificial intelligence, which he believes will never replicate the creative power of a human storyteller.</p>

          <p>Thomas Pynchon's ninth novel, "Shadow Ticket," is hailed in this review as a triumphant work that completes the author's unofficial decade-by-decade chronicle of 20th-century America. Set in the 1930s, the story begins as a gangster novel in Milwaukee before moving to proto-fascist Budapest, blending Pynchon's signature erudite humor with a wistful, twilight tone. The reviewer praises the 88-year-old author's voice as remaining "clarion strong," delivering a novel that is at once a requiem, a farewell, and a warning, solidifying his status as one of America's greatest living writers.</p>

          <p>In a first-of-its-kind campaign, a group of former tenants is launching a debt strike against Equity Residential, one of the largest corporate landlords in the U.S. Organized with the help of the Debt Collective, the tenants are refusing to pay tens of thousands of dollars in rental debt that they argue accumulated unfairly. The campaign is utilizing a new online tool that helps tenants document and dispute claims related to habitability issues, billing irregularities, and other potential legal violations. This new form of housing activism aims to pressure the landlord into debt cancellation by making collection more costly and difficult.</p>
