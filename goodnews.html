          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory nationwide digital ID scheme, aiming to modernize the state and enhance efforts against illegal working. The proposal will be subject to a consultation to determine its practical implementation, including ensuring accessibility for those without smartphones or passports. This initiative revives a concept previously attempted by a Labour government but blocked by a coalition, with Starmer suggesting public sentiment has evolved given the widespread use of digital identification today. The scheme is reportedly intended to streamline checks for an individual's right to live and work in the UK, currently reliant on physical documents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the first of 2025, mortgage rates have dropped to levels not seen since early 2022, now averaging 6.13% for a 30-year fixed loan. This shift has a meaningful impact on homeowners and prospective buyers, as the principal and interest payment on a $400,000 mortgage now stands at approximately $2,431.74 per month. The article highlights that this represents significant monthly savings compared to earlier this year when rates were above 7%, potentially saving borrowers around $240 monthly. This improved rate environment presents attractive opportunities for both new home financing and refinancing existing loans, leading to substantial long-term interest savings.

          <p>Poland's Andrzej Bargiel has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first climber to ski down Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen, as confirmed by his expedition team. Bargiel successfully glided down the 8,849-meter mountain after reaching its summit, a feat made even more challenging by heavy snowfall that forced him to spend 16 hours in the perilous "death zone." This groundbreaking achievement in ski mountaineering follows his previous successful descent of K2 in 2018 and is part of his "Hic Sunt Leones" project, aiming to ski down the world's highest peaks. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk lauded the daredevil adventurer, celebrating this remarkable display of human endurance and skill.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to settle a landmark lawsuit with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accused the company of employing deceptive web designs to "trick" tens of millions of consumers into Prime subscriptions. The FTC alleged that Amazon intentionally crafted a convoluted, multi-step cancellation process to deter members from quitting, and repeatedly postponed plans to simplify it. Without admitting wrongdoing, Amazon has consented to pay a historic $1 billion in civil penalties to the government and an additional $1.5 billion in redress payments to affected consumers. This settlement addresses one significant legal challenge, though the tech giant still faces a larger federal antitrust lawsuit from the FTC concerning its alleged monopoly practices.</p>

          <h2>Former Fed and Treasury Officials Urge Supreme Court to Halt Trump's Firing of Lisa Cook</h2>

          <p>Every living former chair of the Federal Reserve, joined by numerous ex-Treasury secretaries and former White House economic advisors from both Democratic and Republican administrations, has urged the Supreme Court to block President Donald Trump from firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In a compelling legal brief, the group underscored that permitting Cook's removal while her legal challenge is ongoing would critically threaten the Federal Reserve's independence and diminish public confidence in U.S. monetary policy. Trump alleges Cook committed mortgage fraud, which she denies, and her lawsuit has already secured lower court rulings preventing her immediate dismissal. This bipartisan intervention highlights profound concerns over potential political interference in the central bank's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after her body was discovered by a road in a small Spanish town, "the woman in pink" has finally been identified as Liudmila Zavada, a Russian national who was 31 at the time of her suspicious death. This breakthrough resulted from Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, an international initiative launched in 2023 to resolve cold cases of unidentified women murdered or found under suspicious circumstances in Europe. Turkish police successfully matched Zavada's fingerprints from a biometric database, and a subsequent DNA comparison with a close relative confirmed her identity. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza highlighted that such identifications provide renewed hope to families of missing persons and generate crucial new leads for ongoing investigations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, a significant upward revision from earlier estimates, as reported by the Commerce Department. This strong growth represents a rebound from a 0.6% first-quarter drop and was largely propelled by a substantial 2.5% increase in consumer spending. Economists interpret this data as evidence of the economy's continued solid footing, even amidst broader economic challenges like tariffs and a slowing job market. This stronger-than-expected GDP performance may temper the Federal Reserve's eagerness for additional rate cuts in late 2025 and early 2026, despite a recent reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster advises investors against attempting to "time the market," emphasizing the long-held adage that success lies in "time in the market" rather than predicting its fluctuations. He highlights the inherent difficulty of being correct twice—both when exiting and re-entering the market—as clients express nervousness despite their record-high balances, largely propelled by the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Wurster notes a significant increase in client engagement, with trading activity up 30% compared to last year and margin balances reaching an all-time high, yet acknowledges the underlying caution among investors. The Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts are also a key factor influencing the market's current upward trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

Situated just a few hundred light-years from the galactic center's supermassive black hole, Sagittarius B2, despite holding only 10% of the galactic gas, is responsible for producing 50% of its stars. The telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument provided intricate details of gas and dust, while the Near-Infrared Camera unveiled colorful stars illuminating bright clouds. Astronomers will utilize these observations to deepen their understanding of star formation, though the images also present new mysteries, including dark, dense regions that even Webb cannot penetrate, suggesting future stellar nurseries.</p>
