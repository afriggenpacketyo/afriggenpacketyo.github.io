          <p>Euro 2025 host nation Switzerland began their tournament with a 2-1 defeat to Norway, despite an enthusiastic sold-out crowd in Basel. Head coach Pia Sundhage urged her players to embrace the moment, and while the result was disappointing, there is still hope for advancing from the group stage. The event is seen as a pivotal moment for Swiss women's football, with the national federation aiming to leverage the tournament to professionalize its domestic league and double female participation in the sport by 2027.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, was released from an ICE detention center after nearly five months in custody. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon, despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having a pending green card application. Her attorneys condemned her detention and multiple deportation attempts as "brazenly unconstitutional," arguing she was targeted due to her Palestinian identity, and celebrated her return to her family.</p>

Additionally, Cramer noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is beneficial for American consumer packaged goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, by making their exports more competitive globally.
