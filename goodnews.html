          <p>Polish media outlets report that conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki has won the presidential election with 50.89% of the vote, narrowly defeating Trzaskowski. The Electoral Commission has counted all votes and will officially announce the results later on Monday. The Polish president mainly has a ceremonial role, but can veto government bills, command the armed forces, influence foreign policy, and propose new legislation. Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government's reform attempts have been repeatedly blocked by the current conservative incumbent, Andrzej Duda. </p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks surged after both companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. As part of the deal, a new company listed in Sydney will acquire all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks. The merged entity is projected to be worth around $9 billion, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership that was designed to fend off hostile takeovers and promote long-term investment strategies, simplifying the structure, adding scale, and creating a more investable company (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, according to a new report. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible in a challenging financial situation for the sector. Universities UK found reluctance to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws. Greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient, but more clarity is needed to prevent universities from making isolated decisions about course closures or mergers.</p>
