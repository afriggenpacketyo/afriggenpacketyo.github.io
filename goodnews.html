          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to construct the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband envisions a golden age of clean energy abundance. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C condemned the announcement, fearing it would add to consumer bills and undermine value for money. The final investment decision on the funding model is due later this summer, and the project has faced opposition at local and national levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump and several CEOs are promoting savings plans for newborns, with Dell Technologies pledging $1,000 for "Trump accounts" for new children of its employees. The plan, part of a Republican-backed budget bill, would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028. Additional contributions could go up to $5,000 annually, and the funds could be used for college or a down payment on a home. The bill faces pushback in the Senate from fiscally conservative Republicans.</p>

          <p>Rugby league legend Billy Boston is set to receive a knighthood at Buckingham Palace, marking the sport's first such honor in its 130-year history. The knighthood is being awarded early due to concerns about Boston's health, with the official announcement to follow later in the week. Boston, a star player for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, is celebrated as a trailblazer for black sports stars. The move follows growing frustration over the lack of rugby league knighthoods, with some suggesting snobbery was a factor.</p>
