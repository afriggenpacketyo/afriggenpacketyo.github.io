          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has described the UK's Houses of Parliament as inaccessible and difficult to navigate. She points out numerous physical barriers, from heavy doors with smooth handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. While acknowledging the will for change and some recent improvements, Tidball argues that significant work is needed to ensure Parliament reflects the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities and is inclusive for future generations of lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Spending by Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window has set a new record, surpassing £3 billion for the first time. This total, driven by major deadline-day deals like Alexander Isak's £125m move to Liverpool, is significantly higher than last summer's £1.96bn and exceeds the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The high expenditure, particularly from newly promoted clubs, reflects the intense financial competition to succeed and remain in England's top football division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's summer transfer spending of £415 million, a new record for a single club in one window, marks a significant shift from their previously more restrained approach. This spending spree was fueled by a combination of factors, including a transfer fund built from a quiet previous summer, strong commercial growth, and substantial revenue from player sales. The club aimed to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win to attract top talent and evolve the team's style, leading to major acquisitions like Florian Wirtz and the British record signing of Alexander Isak.</p>
