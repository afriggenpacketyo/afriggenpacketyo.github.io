          <p>Lenton Vanburen, one of the remaining fugitives who escaped from a New Orleans jail on May 16th, was captured in Baton Rouge, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. Vanburen, originally incarcerated for parole violation, firearm possession by a felon, and illegal weapon carrying, will face additional charges related to his escape. This arrest marks the sixth fugitive captured after ten inmates made a brazen escape from the Orleans Parish jail earlier this month.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump granted an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted on federal bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Trump stated that Jenkins and his family were unfairly targeted by a corrupt and weaponized Biden Department of Justice, claiming the judge in Jenkins' trial suppressed exculpatory evidence. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 on charges including conspiracy, honest services fraud, and bribery related to federally funded programs, where he received over $75,000 for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs.</p>

          <p>The UK government is shifting apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21 in England, with plans to scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships. This change aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will be eliminated for those over 21, potentially impacting advanced training in sectors like healthcare. Critics argue this move will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for young people who do not attend university.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Harlem native, served in Congress for 46 years, becoming the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House in American history. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate from New York and was a key member of Harlem's "Gang of Four," which included David Dinkins and Percy Sutton; however, his career was marked by an ethics censure in 2010, which forced him to relinquish his chairmanship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As rocket launches become more frequent, physicists are studying the sounds of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the noise impact on communities. Researchers, like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University, are analyzing SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches to determine why they produce a three-part sonic boom. With SpaceX testing the larger and louder Starship rocket, understanding and addressing rocket noise is crucial before it becomes a pervasive problem, potentially influencing launch regulations and community acceptance. The goal is to gather data that could lead to strategies for lessening disruptions caused by rocket launches.</p>

The visit, which included meetings with indigenous leaders and a tree-planting ceremony, reflects Canada's efforts to maintain its identity separate from the United States.</p>
