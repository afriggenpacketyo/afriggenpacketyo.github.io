Black women in the U.S. are significantly more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, and the CWHA's doulas offer psychosocial support, advocacy, and guidance to empower mothers. They assist with birth plans, comfort measures, and postpartum care, ensuring patients' concerns are heard by medical staff.

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the most detailed image to date of 3I-Atlas, the third interstellar object known to have passed through our solar system. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October. The new observations have helped astronomers refine the size of the comet's icy core to no more than 3.5 miles in diameter. The image reveals a teardrop-shaped dust plume and a faint tail, offering valuable data on objects originating from beyond our solar system.</p>

The vessel was actually a four-person crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. After the mix-up was clarified, the MP pledged £1,000 to their cause, while the rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, described the incident as "hilarious."</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man from Southern California is baffled after his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk has been stolen, flown on joyrides, and mysteriously returned on multiple occasions. The owner, Jason Hong, discovered his plane missing from Corona Municipal Airport, only to have it found at other local airports, sometimes with a new battery installed to replace the one he had removed. Flight tracking data shows the plane being taken on several flights, suggesting the unknown pilot is trained. Police are investigating the bizarre case, which currently has no leads, leaving both the owner and authorities perplexed by the motive.</p>

          <p>Guided tours at Mono Lake are educating visitors about the stark ecological consequences of Los Angeles's long-standing water diversions from the region. Since the 1940s, the lake has shrunk dramatically, increasing its salinity and exposing unique tufa tower formations that grew underwater. This has threatened the ecosystem, which supports trillions of brine shrimp and alkali flies, vital food for millions of migratory birds. Although a 1994 state order aimed to raise the lake's level, it remains significantly below the target, prompting renewed calls for action to balance the water needs of both the city and the ancient lake.</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, geopolitical analyst George Friedman discusses his realist perspective on foreign policy, shaped by his family's history fleeing Nazism and communism in Hungary. He argues that American foreign policy, including its actions during the Cold War, is driven more by pragmatic national interests—like preventing a hostile power from controlling the Atlantic—than by pure ideology. Friedman views the Trump administration's approach as a deconstruction of an obsolete post-WWII system, a chaotic but normal part of a recurring 50-year American cycle of crisis and reinvention. He remains optimistic that this "storm" will ultimately lead to a period of calm and regeneration.</p>

The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international scored 12 goals last season and was named Nice's player of the season. His arrival provides much-needed reinforcement to Villa's attack, where Ollie Watkins was the only recognized senior center forward. This is Aston Villa's second major signing of the summer, as the club navigates financial rules set by both the Premier League and UEFA, for which it was recently fined.</p>

The NCA stated that people smugglers operate for profit without regard for human safety and that their investigation is ongoing.
