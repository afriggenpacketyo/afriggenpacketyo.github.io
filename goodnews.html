          <p>A New York judge has ruled that critical DNA evidence, derived from novel whole genome sequencing technology, will be admissible in the Gilgo Beach serial killer case against Rex Heuermann. Prosecutors successfully contended that the technology is generally accepted in the scientific community, allowing for the use of DNA results from rootless hairs recovered from six victims. This decision is significant as it marks the first time these advanced techniques are permitted as evidence in a New York court, potentially accelerating the prosecution of other cold cases. Heuermann, who was arrested in July 2023, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of seven women.</p>

          <p>The EU Commission has given its approval to major trade agreements with the South American bloc Mercosur, comprising Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and separately with Mexico, labeling them as crucial "milestones." These deals aim to diversify the EU's trade relationships and are projected to foster economic growth by reducing tariffs and costs for European businesses and the agrifood sector. The Mercosur agreement, in particular, will see the removal of tariffs on 91% of EU imports, while also allowing more agricultural products from South America, despite some opposition from EU farmers. These agreements now await approval from at least 15 of the EU's 27 member states to take effect.</p>

          <p>The Netflix animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has achieved global success by subverting traditional K-pop stereotypes, presenting a girl band, HUNTR/X, who are both pop idols and demon hunters. This portrayal features powerful, flawed, and relatable young women, challenging the industry's image of perfectly disciplined stars. The film further innovates by having behind-the-scenes musical talents, such as songwriter EJAE, voice characters, leading to massive streaming numbers for its soundtrack. Its popularity is attributed to its narrative of resilience and transformation, allowing global audiences to connect with characters who authentically overcome personal and external struggles.</p>

          <p>BGO, a global real estate investment manager, is revolutionizing its strategy by employing artificial intelligence and data science to pinpoint undervalued local markets, leading to substantial outperformance. Co-CEO John Carrafiell noted that their model, built on two decades of proprietary deal data and thousands of diverse inputs, focuses on local market fundamentals rather than broad economic trends. This analytical edge enabled them to achieve remarkable returns, such as on an industrial development in Las Vegas, by identifying significant cost efficiencies for logistics operations. BGO aims to further develop its AI model to optimize asset allocation across various commercial real estate sectors, continuously refining its investment approach. (not investment advice)</p>

Both countries express optimism about doubling their trade volume, despite current global trade protectionism and recent U.S. tariffs impacting India. Wadephul's engagements also encompassed cultural and business visits, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the two nations' strategic partnership.</p>

          <p>Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (MLYS) stock experienced a significant surge, reaching a new all-time high with an 86% increase, driven by positive trial results announced by AstraZeneca for its aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASI) drug, Baxdrostat. AstraZeneca's experimental drug demonstrated a notable reduction in systolic blood pressure for patients with difficult-to-control hypertension, fueling investor optimism for Mineralys's own ASI candidate, Lorundrostat, which is currently in development. Concurrently, Mineralys launched a $175 million follow-on offering to finance the clinical development, research, and pre-commercialization efforts for Lorundrostat, reflecting strong market confidence in this therapeutic area.

          <p>"Phantom energy," or vampire energy, describes the electricity consumed by electronic devices that remain plugged in but are not actively in use, typically constituting 5% to 10% of household energy consumption. This constant, hidden drain exacerbates climate change by increasing demand for electricity, often sourced from emission-generating power plants. Common culprits include smart televisions with wake features and appliances with digital clocks. Experts advocate for simple solutions such as unplugging chargers, disabling unnecessary smart features, or using power strips to cut power. These small individual actions, when adopted widely, can collectively lead to substantial reductions in U.S. emissions and promote broader sustainable behaviors.</p>

          <p>A DW fact-check thoroughly debunked President Trump's recurring assertion that Democrat-led cities exhibit higher crime rates. The article acknowledges that a majority of large U.S. cities are indeed governed by Democrats and often report higher crime rates than rural areas, but stresses that this correlation does not establish causation. FBI guidelines explicitly advise against ranking cities by crime data, citing numerous complex variables like population density and economic conditions that influence rates. Furthermore, a comprehensive study by Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning nearly three decades, found no discernible impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing outcomes.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with substantial home equity are increasingly considering HELOCs and home equity loans as cost-effective borrowing solutions, with average interest rates currently hovering around 8%, significantly lower than other consumer lending products. This article compares the affordability of these options, highlighting that HELOCs offer variable rates and a flexible draw period, while home equity loans provide fixed rates and predictable monthly payments. Financial experts emphasize evaluating not only interest rates but also repayment terms, potential future rate changes, and additional fees like closing costs. The optimal choice ultimately hinges on a borrower's specific financial objectives, comfort with variable rates, and the intended use of the funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, launching lava 500 feet into the sky from its summit crater within Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. This 13-hour event, marking the 32nd episode of an ongoing eruption, generated an estimated 337 million cubic feet of molten rock, covering a substantial portion of the crater floor. Although the lava remained contained and no injuries were reported, the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings about elevated levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which forms volcanic smog and poses respiratory health risks.

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a significant 9% surge after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's proposed breakup of Google in a landmark antitrust case. Although Google was found to possess an illegal monopoly in its core internet search market, the court rejected the most drastic remedies, including the divestiture of its Chrome browser and Android operating system. This decision allows Google to continue its lucrative agreements, such as paying Apple billions to remain the default search engine on iPhones, a ruling hailed as a "home run." The outcome alleviates a major market overhang, reinforcing confidence in Google's search business and its ambitious AI ventures like Gemini. (not investment advice)</p>
