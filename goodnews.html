          <p>President Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's potential acquisition of U.S. Steel includes a "golden share," granting him significant control over major corporate decisions.  This unusual arrangement allows Trump to potentially block the relocation of U.S. Steel's headquarters or jobs outside the U.S.  The golden share's details remain unclear, including its transferability to future presidents. The deal mandates significant new investments but faces criticism from the U.S. Steelworkers union.</p>
