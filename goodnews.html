        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article discusses how the perception of the United States as a threat to China through peaceful evolution has diminished under the Trump administration. The author reflects on how, during their upbringing in China, they were taught to be wary of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party. However, with China's rise as a global power and the US shifting away from nation-building, the perceived threat has receded. The author posits that Trump's policies have inadvertently lessened China's concerns about American influence. Optimism is reflected in the stability of the state of China's relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma regarding her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication and clearly stating one's desires within a relationship. Drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy, the advice underscores the need for freedom and support for personal growth in love, while cautioning against masochistic self-sacrifice. The article suggests the couple work on strengthening their emotional connection before considering non-monogamy, and that the husband should cease flirting with his colleague until the couple is aligned on the terms of their relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at the Naples airport. Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, citing operational limitations as the reason for the diversion. Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. The situation is frustrating for the passengers but the circumstances are relatively stable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's aim to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough to meet demand. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and a significant portion is nearing retirement, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field by raising wages and offering on-the-job training. While some experts are doubtful that jobs shipped abroad will return, high-value sectors like aviation are more likely to remain in the US. The optimism score reflects the challenge of filling skilled positions, balanced by efforts to attract new talent.</p>
