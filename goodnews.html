        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's Communist Party, has issued a warning about the potential "addiction" and "out-of-control consumption" of blind boxes and blind card packs among young people in China, especially as the summer holiday approaches. The article emphasizes the allure of "unknown surprises" that can lead to impulsive spending and commercial traps. This caution mirrors previous regulations aimed at preventing online gaming addiction among teenagers, reflecting growing concerns about the impact of the "guzi economy" on the younger generation as the blind box purchases carry an element of gambling, augmented by the varied designs and rarity levels used by merchants to attract consumers. The article suggests strict identity verification to curb excessive spending by minors. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state. The capital increase, along with a debt refinancing plan, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's biggest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, with India's Bharti Space Limited holding 18.7%. The company's shares have been volatile this year, with a spike in March based on expectations that it could be a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed and tested an artillery-launched drone system capable of withstanding the extreme forces of a 155mm cannon. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defence contractor Norinco. The drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiply flight range, significantly save power consumption and extend loiter time, according to the team led by senior engineer Huang Yunluan. The system orchestrates a sequence of precisely timed detonations to separate the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight while shielding it from aerodynamic damage ‚Äì all without electronic controls.</p>

          <p>A West Coast sheriff is considering billing hikers who are reckless or negligent for their rescue, after a surge in search-and-rescue missions in Skamania County, Washington. The proposed ordinance aims to deter risky behavior and recoup the financial burden placed on the county, with similar measures being considered in other areas like southern Utah. The idea of charging irresponsible hikers has been debated before, with some states like New Hampshire offering "Hike Safe Cards" to support search-and-rescue efforts. However, some search-and-rescue organizations oppose the idea, arguing that it could deter people from seeking help when they need it.</p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts after the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to buy fire-razed lots and guide the rebuilding process. The commission also proposes a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District, funded through a property tax, to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management. The commission also recommends fast-tracking permitting for all-electric homes and providing incentives for electrification and solar power.</p>

          <p>The musical "Parade" tells the story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1913 Georgia, and his subsequent lynching. The musical explores antisemitism, systemic bias in the judicial system, and the power of demagoguery. Director Michael Arden's Tony-winning revival has arrived at the Ahmanson Theatre, revealing the contemporary parallels within the show.
