          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement. The agreement includes a 'golden share' for the U.S. government, granting the president significant control over key decisions, such as relocating headquarters or transferring production overseas. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the golden share provides veto power over actions like renaming U.S. Steel or idling plants prematurely. While Trump describes the transaction as a 'partnership,' U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.</p>

          <p>AMD's stock price rose significantly after Piper Sandler analysts increased their price target, expressing optimism about the company's upcoming GPU performance. The analysts anticipate a rebound in AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, following the absorption of charges related to new U.S. export regulations concerning semiconductors to China. This optimism stems from AMD's recent unveiling of its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack. The analysts believe the Helios rack is crucial for AMD Instinct's growth, as it allows thousands of chips to be connected, making it attractive to cloud companies and large language model developers.

          <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled in favor of allowing a grand jury to investigate allegations of clergy sexually abusing children, reversing years of opposition from the Camden diocese. The diocese had initially argued against the grand jury, citing court rules, but recently withdrew its objection following a change in leadership. The court's decision permits the state attorney general's office to proceed with its investigation into decades of allegations against church officials. The attorney general's office praised the decision, reaffirming its commitment to supporting survivors of sexual abuse, and the Camden diocese pledged its cooperation.</p>

          <p>Google has issued an apology for a major outage that impacted over 70 of its cloud services, including Gmail, Google Calendar, and third-party platforms like Cloudflare and Shopify. The company attributed the disruption to flawed updates related to a new feature in its 'quota policy checks,' which were not adequately tested in real-world conditions. The incident report detailed that blank entries from the new feature caused system crashes, leading to an overload in larger regions. Google plans to implement feature flags for gradual rollout and enhance system architecture to prevent future cascading failures, while also improving communication with customers during incidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that approximately 67% of newlyweds took on debt to finance their wedding, highlighting the financial pressures associated with such events. While paying in cash is the preferred option, some financial experts suggest that incurring debt for a high-priority wedding is acceptable, provided it is managed carefully. Utilizing a credit card with a 0% introductory offer or securing a personal line of credit from a bank are considered wiser borrowing strategies. Regardless of the chosen method, establishing a repayment plan is crucial to prevent debt from overshadowing the marital experience and hindering future financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposed California bill aims to increase transparency and accountability in law enforcement by requiring local, state, and federal officers to show their faces and be identifiable by their uniforms. The bill, introduced by State Sens. Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, would make it a misdemeanor for officers to cover their faces while conducting official business, with exceptions for the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal comes in response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles where federal officers covered their faces, raising concerns about impersonation and lack of accountability.</p>
