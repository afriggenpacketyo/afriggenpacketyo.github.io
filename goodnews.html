The FBI also made progress on high-profile cases, including the COVID-19 cover-up, the Dobbs leak, and the DNC pipe bomb investigation, apprehending three of the FBI‚Äôs top ten "most wanted." Bongino stated that numerous personnel changes were made to the FBI's leadership and the agency reorganized its structure to prevent past mistakes from being repeated. The FBI also coordinated with federal partners to apprehend, imprison, and deport thousands of illegal immigrants and made over 700 anti-ICE riot arrests. Bongino affirmed the FBI's commitment to protecting the Homeland and pursuing those involved in rioting and public corruption. </p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison after five years, along with 13 other political prisoners, and reunited with his wife in Lithuania. Tikhanovskaya announced her husband's release with a video of their reunion, expressing her joy. The release coincided with a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg and a meeting with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky, an activist who challenged Lukashenko in the 2020 elections, was jailed for 18 years in 2021 on charges of rallying mass protests. His release is seen as a significant diplomatic breakthrough for Lukashenko, potentially easing his isolation from Western politicians, although it does not signal an end to political repression in Belarus. </p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of its chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens. The recall includes six lots of semi-sweet chocolate with "Christmas Seeds" colored nonpareils and 15 lots of semi-sweet chocolate with white nonpareils. The FDA warns that individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities could experience severe allergic reactions if they consume the affected products. No illnesses have been reported, but the company is working with the FDA to ensure product safety. The issue was discovered after a customer complaint and subsequent lab testing confirmed the presence of milk. </p>

Jobe's goal came 45 minutes into his debut, slightly longer than it took Jude to score in his first start back in 2020. The 19-year-old's goal demonstrated anticipation, poise, agility, and ruthlessness, capping off a fine display on his full debut. Jobe has been working on arriving late in the box to score, a skill reminiscent of his brother Jude's knack for finding the net. </p>

          <p>Torsten Sl√∏k, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, laid out a potential scenario where President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are extended long enough to ease economic uncertainty while also providing a significant bump to federal revenue. Sl√∏k speculated that maintaining tariffs on China and other countries could give them time to lower non-tariff barriers and open up their economies to trade. He added that this would reduce uncertainty, giving a boost to business planning, employment, and financial markets. Sl√∏k's speculation is notable as he previously sounded the alarm on Trump‚Äôs tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
