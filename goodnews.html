          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. If completed, it would be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, with an estimated cost of €13.5 billion. The project, first approved in 1971, has faced numerous cancellations over financial and practical concerns, including its location in a seismically active area. Proponents highlight the potential for economic prosperity and job creation, while opponents argue the funds should be redirected to existing infrastructure needs.</p>

Etiquette expert Elaine Swann suggests that the key is respecting that you are in someone else's space, even if you are close with them. Key tips include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length like three nights, and communicating expectations beforehand. A good guest is also self-sufficient, doesn't overstay their welcome, and shows appreciation with a thoughtful gift, ensuring they will be invited back in the future.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly dismissed any peace deal that would involve ceding Ukrainian land to Russia, calling such proposals "dead solutions." His statement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the conflict. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any legitimate peace process must involve Ukraine directly at the negotiating table. This stance highlights Kyiv's anxieties about being sidelined in crucial discussions that could determine the country's future.</p>

When play was stopped, American Collin Morikawa and England's Justin Rose were among those in pursuit at nine under.

          <p>The Mexican government has firmly stated that it will not permit U.S. military operations within its territory, following reports that President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum emphasized that while the two countries cooperate on security, a U.S. military incursion is "absolutely ruled out." The reported directive appears to follow an executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations. Mexican officials maintain that any such designation cannot be used as a pretext for the U.S. to violate its national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut celebrated for his command of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell became a national hero in 1970 after an onboard explosion crippled his spacecraft, forcing the moon landing to be aborted and creating a desperate struggle for survival. His calm leadership was instrumental in guiding his crew safely back to Earth, a feat immortalized in the film "Apollo 13." Also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, he was the first person to fly to the Moon twice, and his life is remembered as a testament to courage and unshakeable optimism.</p>

The article outlines the primary negotiating points, including military de-escalation, Ukraine's potential NATO membership, and the status of Russian-occupied territories. While Trump seeks a significant diplomatic achievement, Putin aims to secure concessions on NATO expansion and formalize territorial gains. The fundamental conflict remains over Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, making a mutually agreeable long-term solution highly complex and challenging to achieve.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of EU-India relations. However, experts believe this move is largely symbolic and will not derail progress on a long-delayed free trade agreement between the two powers. The article suggests that the more significant pressure on India comes from the United States and the threat of high tariffs from the Trump administration. This dynamic may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU, potentially accelerating trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a pure, large hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough for a material previously found only in meteorite craters. This rare form of diamond, known as lonsdaleite, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to be significantly harder. Published in the journal Nature, the research details the synthesis of high-purity hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size. This achievement provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and could pave the way for new ultra-hard industrial applications.</p>
