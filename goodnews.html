        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has encountered significant obstacles within the House of Representatives, as Republicans fail to pass the measure through the budget committee due to internal disagreements over the extent of budget cuts. Primary points of contention include the amount to be cut from the budget, specifically concerning Medicaid, with some conservatives demanding steeper reductions. Lawmakers from states with high taxes also object to the proposed cap on state and local tax deductions, further complicating the bill's passage, highlighting the deep divisions within the Republican Party regarding fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UK-EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as critical negotiating points. The EU is advocating for a new "youth mobility scheme" to allow young people to move freely between the UK and EU, while the UK expresses concerns about potential impacts on immigration numbers. Fishing rights are also contentious, with the EU seeking an extension of current post-Brexit arrangements and UK fishing groups pushing for changes. The outcome of these discussions could significantly shape future relations between the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>As one of gaming's oldest series, Doom faces the challenge of attracting new players in a market dominated by free-to-play titles and annually updated franchises. The executive producer of Doom: The Dark Ages discusses strategies for competing with these "forever games," emphasizing the game's shorter length and curated experience. The director highlights the game's new "Medieval sci-fi" setting and customizable difficulty, aiming to broaden its appeal. While debates over game pricing persist, the developers assert that Doom offers a valuable, one-off purchase without hidden costs, contrasting with the potential for expensive in-game purchases in free-to-play games.</p>

          <p>The California Board of Environmental Safety unanimously voted to rescind a proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil, which is currently required to be disposed of at designated hazardous waste sites. Concerns were raised by environmental advocates and community members about potential toxic dust and groundwater contamination. The decision followed months of scrutiny and public meetings where state officials apologized for the plan's impact. The board's action ensures that California's stringent hazardous waste standards for contaminated soil are maintained.</p>
