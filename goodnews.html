          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk's official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending, but hinted at ongoing collaboration. Musk's service concludes after the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. During his time at DOGE, the initiative reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though Democrats have criticized Musk's influence and potential conflicts of interest. Musk reassured Tesla shareholders that he would allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX starting in June, now that his work at DOGE is complete.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail line connecting Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume service on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction to stabilize the rail line, which serves Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. Crews placed 5,900 tons of boulders and will add up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand to protect the rail. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the project's total cost at around $300 million.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled the world's first AI nuclear inspector, a technology disclosed in a peer-reviewed paper by researchers with the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The project aims to enhance Beijing‚Äôs position in international disarmament talks but raises debates about AI's role in managing weapons of mass destruction. The project faced hurdles, including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and convincing military leaders of its security. So far, only the initial training step has been completed due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing a craniotomy following his IBF minimumweight title match. The 25-year-old former world champion suffered a right subdural hematoma after losing a split decision to Filipino champion Pedro Taduran. Shigeoka was not knocked down during the bout but lost consciousness after the final bell. Under Japan Boxing Commission rules, a boxer who has had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license, meaning Shigeoka must retire from the sport.</p>

          <p>Costco exceeded earnings expectations, demonstrating its ability to navigate tariff-related challenges. The retailer's better-than-expected results indicated its preparedness to handle potential obstacles. Total revenue in its third quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased 8% year over year to $63.2 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates. The company's size, global scale, and limited product offerings enable it to mitigate tariff impacts by rerouting goods and increasing locally produced items. (not investment advice)</p>
