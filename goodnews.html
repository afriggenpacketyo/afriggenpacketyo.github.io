          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by producing a simple, customizable pickup truck. The company's basic model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can modify with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. While initially advertised below $20,000 with federal tax credits, the rollback of these incentives may push the price closer to $28,000. This price point puts it in competition with established models like the Ford Maverick, raising questions about its market competitiveness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new terms, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain control of the department, rather than a federally appointed administrator. The agreement followed a lawsuit filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move a 'hostile takeover,' and a federal judge signaling she would likely block the administration's plan. This development marks a significant de-escalation in the power struggle over local governance and policing in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly negotiating a secondary stock sale of around $6 billion, which would place the company's valuation at approximately $500 billion. The transaction would allow current and former employees to sell shares to investors including SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, and Thrive Capital. This potential valuation reflects staggering growth for the company, which was valued at $300 billion in a funding round earlier this year. The talks follow the recent, though somewhat rocky, rollout of OpenAI's latest advanced AI model, GPT-5.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead a developmental T20 squad on a tour of Ireland in September while many of the team's senior players are rested. The decision is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer and has never captained at the full senior level before. The previous record was held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 when he captained England in a Test match in 1889.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited numerous social media posts where Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a 'Kremlin asset' and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice and that punitive damages were warranted to deter similar behavior. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case against Patel for abuse of the legal system.</p>

The media and lifestyle brand plans to establish a new corporate office and a new Playboy Club in Miami Beach.

President Trump has frequently called for more high-end technology to be produced domestically, and this potential action aligns with that strategic goal. (not investment advice)</p>
