          <p>China's state-backed "national team" investors, spearheaded by Central Huijin Investment, held a substantial 3.94 trillion yuan (US$553.1 billion) in yuan-denominated stocks by the end of June. This significant state presence, which surpassed foreign investors' holdings, accounts for 4.8% of the publicly tradable market capitalization, second only to mutual funds. The article highlights how these massive holdings have contributed to a decade-high benchmark for onshore stocks, reflecting top leaders' efforts to promote financial stability and position the stock market as a wealth preservation tool amid a property market downturn. Analysts anticipate that this robust state support for the market will persist, potentially leading to further stock increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to mandate states cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. US District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, mostly Democratic, that accused FEMA of "holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage." The article notes that the ruling is a legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). New York Attorney General Letitia James hailed the decision, stating the federal government cannot prioritize its immigration agenda over public safety.</p>

This arrangement, part of the "monumental" deal, provides OpenAI with cost-efficient access to the immense compute power needed to build and train large language models and run AI workloads.
