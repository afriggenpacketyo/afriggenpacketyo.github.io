          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has been a key figure in advocating for the reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes a significant expansion of RECA, potentially compensating individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, along with "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation. This expansion aims to cover those affected by toxic waste exposure, and the proposal also allows claims for increased atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers to the eligible beneficiaries. Hawley views this as a major victory for those affected by nuclear exposure, emphasizing the country's support for them. The optimism score is intended to reflect the positive impact of this legislative progress on affected communities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declined to rehear President Trump's challenge to a $5 million civil judgment, which stemmed from a 2023 jury verdict finding him liable for battery and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. The case involved Carroll's claim that Trump attacked her in the 1990s and subsequently defamed her by denying the incident. While a three-judge panel initially declined to overturn the judgment, Trump sought a hearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which was ultimately denied. Carroll's attorney expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation; he is also appealing a separate $83 million defamation award to Carroll.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June showed a significant rebound, driven by reduced pessimism about the economy and potential inflation surges, as progress in the global trade war appeared possible. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers indicated across-the-board improvements, with the headline index rising to 60.5, surpassing expectations. This improvement coincided with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, leading to a 90-day negotiation period that showed promise, particularly with China. While sentiment indexes remained below year-ago readings, the one-year inflation outlook tumbled, indicating reduced fears about the tariff's impact on future inflation (not investment advice).</p>
