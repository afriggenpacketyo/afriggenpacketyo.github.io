          <p>Chimney Rock Village, a small tourist town in North Carolina, is gradually recovering from severe flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane Helene. Although initial hopes were to reopen by Memorial Day, the mayor acknowledges that this timeline was overly optimistic. Progress is visible throughout the town, but significant work remains to fully restore the area. The town's recovery is ongoing, with efforts focused on repairing infrastructure and businesses to welcome visitors back.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles in an effort to reduce rising prices, with the goal of reaching approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action addresses public criticism regarding the government's perceived ineffectiveness in managing rice prices, which have significantly increased amidst broader inflationary pressures. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system to exert greater control over pricing. The move follows the appointment of a new farm minister after his predecessor resigned due to a gaffe about rice purchases.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a notable increase from previous years.

The company employs a multi-faceted approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews. Most paid reviews originate in Asia, and Tripadvisor is continuously working to improve its detection methods to maintain the integrity of its platform.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years, accounting for ongoing tensions with the U.S. and internal structural challenges. Xu highlights the importance of addressing issues like a shrinking population, declining savings, and debt. He argues that prioritizing employment and debt control alongside a 4% growth rate would be more beneficial. China's current plan does not specify a quantitative growth target, but estimates suggest an annual expansion of at least 4.8% to meet long-term economic goals. (not investment advice)</p>
