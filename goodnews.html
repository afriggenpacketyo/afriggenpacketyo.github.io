          <p>The S&P 500 index achieved a new all-time high, closing above 6,156 as the stock market continued its recent surge. This rally has persisted despite investor concerns over international trade tensions and conflict in the Middle East. Analysts suggest that cautious optimism is prevailing, driven by a rollback of some tariffs and data indicating a resilient economy with sturdy hiring and controlled inflation. The market's performance reflects a shift in focus from geopolitical risks to positive domestic economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has publicly stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 season. Although Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028, it is believed to contain break clauses that could facilitate an early exit. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations may be influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the Dutch driver. The potential move is fueled by speculation about Red Bull's future performance and Mercedes' development for the 2026 regulation changes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are divided on the value of purchasing whole life insurance for children as a financial planning tool. Proponents argue that it locks in lifelong insurability at a low premium, which can be beneficial if the child later develops health issues, and provides a death benefit for final expenses. However, critics point out that the likelihood of a child's death is extremely low and that the cash value component of these policies typically offers a much lower return than other investment vehicles like a 529 plan or a brokerage account.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer savers a valuable opportunity to earn returns that outpace the rate of inflation. While national average yields for CDs are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some 3-year and 5-year CDs offering over 4% APY. The article suggests that savers can secure the best rates by looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently have higher yields due to an inverted yield curve. This environment allows investors to lock in favorable, guaranteed returns for a set period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine, identifying a "genetic switch" that could potentially enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue. The study, published in the journal Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a dormant gene responsible for this acid's production, the researchers successfully triggered ear tissue regeneration in mice. This discovery could pave the way for new therapies to advance tissue and organ regeneration in humans.</p>
