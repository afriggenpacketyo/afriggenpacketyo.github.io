          <p>Researchers in China have utilized the rare mineral tellurium to develop an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. This innovation involves nanowire implants that convert light into electrical signals, bypassing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. Tellurium's unique photoelectric properties make it suitable for this application, potentially offering a treatment for human blindness.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study challenges traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women.</p>
