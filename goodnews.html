          <p>Japanese investment firm SoftBank is set to acquire a $2 billion stake in Intel, purchasing shares at $23 each. This announcement follows reports of potential U.S. government investment aimed at helping Intel establish a major manufacturing hub in Ohio, part of a broader effort to bolster domestic semiconductor production. The investment is seen as a strong vote of confidence in Intel's strategic turnaround and its central role in America's technology and national security landscape. Analysts note this move helps reduce U.S. dependence on Asian chip markets and accelerates domestic manufacturing capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new S&P report, Chinese exports to developing nations in the Global South have doubled since 2015, with growth accelerating significantly after the U.S.-China trade war. Over the past five years, these exports surged by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the United States and Western Europe. China now sends approximately $1.6 trillion in goods to the Global South, over 50% more than its combined exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. Analysts predict this trend will continue as Chinese firms seek new markets amid ongoing trade uncertainties, potentially shifting the center of global commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting at the White House, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected within the next two weeks. Merz, who attended the talks with other European leaders and U.S. President Donald Trump, expressed that his expectations for the summit were exceeded. The location for the proposed meeting has not yet been determined. Merz cautioned, however, that Ukraine should not be pressured into ceding the Donbas region, emphasizing that such a demand is unacceptable for Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced that he has initiated arrangements for a face-to-face meeting between the Ukrainian leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a social media post, Trump stated that this bilateral meeting would be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. This development marks a potential step forward, as previous attempts to bring the two leaders together have been unsuccessful. The Kremlin's official response mentioned support for continued negotiations and raising the level of representatives, but did not explicitly confirm a one-on-one meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed concern that the artificial intelligence sector is currently in an investment bubble, with startup valuations becoming "insane." Despite this, he affirmed his belief in AI's long-term value and announced that OpenAI should be expected to spend trillions of dollars on datacenter construction in the near future to meet growing compute demand. Altman revealed OpenAI is already looking beyond Microsoft Azure and has signed a deal with Google Cloud, stating the company's needs exceed what any single provider can offer. He conceded that some investors will likely get "very burnt" in the short term but maintained that AI's societal benefits will be tremendous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis highlights Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's changed demeanor during his latest White House meeting with President Trump, contrasting it with a contentious visit six months prior. Dressed more formally and expressing gratitude, Zelenskyy appeared to heed advice from European allies to avoid confrontation. He successfully navigated the meeting, which also included leaders from several NATO nations, to secure a commitment from Trump to help arrange direct talks with Vladimir Putin. The article suggests that despite Trump's unpredictable nature and wandering attention, the European and Ukrainian delegations managed to keep the discussions focused and prevent a diplomatic breakdown, unlike the previous encounter.</p>

Regions like Fujian province are targeting growth in emerging areas such as offshore energy, tourism, and digitalized marine governance. Fujian has already launched a provincial marine data platform that has aggregated nearly 16 billion data entries for use in ecological protection and emergency response. These initiatives reflect a broader push by China to leverage its geographic advantages and develop new, sustainable sources of economic growth through its extensive coastline and maritime resources.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to realign teams geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences. Speaking at the Little League World Series, Manfred suggested that such a move would reduce travel wear and tear on players and create more appealing postseason matchups for broadcast partners. While the idea could face resistance from traditionalists, it would aim to foster regional rivalries and improve broadcast schedules. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved before his term ends in 2029.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has collected long tubes of mud from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of ocean history and the impact of human activity on the climate. By analyzing the layers of sediment, researchers can reconstruct past marine life, measure pollution levels, and calculate how much carbon is stored on the seafloor. A key focus of the research is to use environmental DNA to measure how industrial whaling affected the Southern Ocean's ability to sequester carbon. This data will help scientists better understand the crucial relationship between the ocean and the global climate, providing insights from a time before modern monitoring was possible.</p>

          <p>A landmark wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved 5 kilometers (3 miles) in one piece to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure, built in 1912, has been placed on giant rolling platforms for the two-day journey to the new city center. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's buildings away from the unstable ground. The local mining company, LKAB, is funding the entire relocation, which includes moving the church with its valuable interior altar painting and organ still inside.</p>

Under the settlement, HelloFresh will pay $6.38 million in civil penalties, $1 million in restitution to affected California consumers, and investigative costs. While HelloFresh denied any wrongdoing, the district attorney's office stated that the company failed to clearly disclose its subscription terms, a violation of state laws on automatic renewal and false advertising, and is now required to change its business practices.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax." The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. This move was prompted by Kentucky's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to enact a nationwide ban. The unregulated drug, linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, is often passed off as legitimate prescription medication and poses a significant public health threat.</p>
