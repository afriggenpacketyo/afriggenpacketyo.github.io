          <p>Former President Donald Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand following an escalation in border clashes that have resulted in numerous casualties. He stated on social media that he spoke with the leaders of both nations, who are reportedly open to peace talks and de-escalation. Trump indicated that the U.S. would not resume trade negotiations with either country until the fighting ceases completely. The statement comes as the U.N. Security Council and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also push for a peaceful resolution to the deadly conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas in designated locations to help revitalize struggling town centers. This initiative seeks to support the hospitality industry, which has seen numerous closures due to economic pressures and disputes over noise, by promoting al fresco dining and live performances.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas made a sudden descent of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision shortly after departing from Hollywood Burbank Airport. The pilots of Flight 1496 took evasive action after receiving an onboard traffic alert about another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in the vicinity. While no passengers reported injuries, one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries after the plane landed safely in Las Vegas. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it is investigating the incident to determine the circumstances that led to the near-miss.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a diplomatic visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing economic and strategic ties with the island nation. The visit comes after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on a pro-China platform, previously insisted on the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, signaling a renewed effort to counter China's increasing influence in the key Indian Ocean region. President Muizzu reciprocated by describing India as the Maldives' "closest and most trusted partner."</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is officially in the works, according to director Gurinder Chadha. The 2002 movie, which starred Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is widely credited with inspiring a generation of female soccer players. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film in 2027 make it the right time to revisit the characters. While the format is still undecided, she hopes to reunite the original cast for the new project.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby coach Joe Schmidt has criticized the referee's decision not to penalize a clearout by Jac Morgan in the final moments of their 29-26 loss to the British and Irish Lions. The play immediately preceded the match-winning try by Hugo Keenan, which secured the series for the tourists. Schmidt argued the clearout was dangerous and went against the sport's push for player safety, but the Television Match Official upheld the on-field decision. The controversial ending denied Australia a chance to force a series decider, compounding the team's painful defeat in a tightly contested match.</p>

          <p>A new advertising campaign for American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has coincided with a notable rise in the company's stock price. The ads, which embrace a traditionally alluring aesthetic, are being viewed as a departure from the message-driven marketing common today. Investors appear to be betting that this more direct, product-focused approach will drive a significant increase in sales. The article suggests this move could signal a broader shift on Wall Street back toward prioritizing profit through proven advertising strategies over conforming to politically motivated trends.
