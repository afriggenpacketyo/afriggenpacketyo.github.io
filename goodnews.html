          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its stop-work order on Equinor's Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm project in New York, allowing construction to resume after a compromise was reached regarding a gas pipeline. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the decision came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials, highlighting the project's support for 1,500 union jobs. Equinor aims to proceed with installation activities this year, minimizing the impact of the work stoppage to commence commercial operations by 2027, marking the first offshore wind project to directly supply electricity to New York City. The initial order was issued by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who cited insufficient analysis and consultation regarding potential effects.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that would permit asset managers to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially providing investors with more choices and tax benefits. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, seeking to operate under a similar structure to Vanguard's existing approach. A key concern for the SEC is ensuring that ETF shareholders are not negatively impacted by tax liabilities typically associated with mutual funds. Dimensional Fund Advisors has proposed updated guidelines for fund oversight to address these tax implications, potentially setting a template for the industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to rally support for his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," emphasizing the need for party unity despite significant disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Trump praised Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts and expressed confidence in the bill's passage, while hard-line conservatives are pushing for steeper spending cuts and the elimination of clean energy subsidies. Moderates, on the other hand, are resisting changes to Medicaid and demanding higher caps on state and local tax deductions.

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has sparked debate about the reliability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind. While some have blamed Spain's high reliance on renewables, experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues rather than inherent problems with renewable energy. The article discusses the need for grid systems to adapt to renewable sources through technologies like virtual inertia and improved energy storage. Investments in grids need to double by 2030 to support the transition to a low-carbon and stable energy system.</p>
