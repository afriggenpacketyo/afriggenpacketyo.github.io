        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to encourage firms to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country. This initiative is expected to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The government will also introduce new training commitments to help unemployed individuals re-enter the UK labor market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns over reduced state revenue. Senior officials in his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also been hesitant about a consumption tax cut, as the government prepares an economic package before the House of Councillors election this summer. The consumption tax is currently at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States and China have made "great progress" in high-level trade discussions held in Geneva. These talks, the first face-to-face meeting between senior officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods, aimed to de-escalate trade tensions. The discussions covered numerous issues in a constructive manner, according to Trump. The United States has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax.</p>

          <p>Kazuto Ioka was unable to reclaim the WBA super flyweight belt from Argentine boxer Fernando Martinez in their rematch.

Ioka briefly gained momentum by flooring Martinez in the 10th round, but ultimately could not overcome the deficit on the scorecards. Ioka's record now stands at 31 wins, four losses, and one draw.</p>

          <p>Charlotte and Raffi Grinberg moved next door to their best friends, creating a village to raise their children together.

The friends share child-care responsibilities and create a close-knit environment for their children to grow up in, which promotes a sense of community and support.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the influence of sibling relationships on each other's personalities, academics, and careers. It highlights research showing that siblings can have a significant impact, particularly in disadvantaged families. The piece challenges the idea of birth-order psychology, noting that qualities often attributed to birth order may not hold up in well-conducted studies. The article suggests that genes, the environment, and parenting choices all play a role in shaping individuals, but perhaps less than parents might think.</p>
