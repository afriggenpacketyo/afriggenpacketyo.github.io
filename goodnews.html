          <p>President Trump announced that a trade deal with China is "done" but requires final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping. The agreement reportedly involves China supplying rare earths and magnets upfront, while the U.S. will allow Chinese students to attend American colleges and universities. Trump stated that the U.S. would receive 55% tariffs, while China's tariffs would be set at 10%. This announcement follows high-level talks in London, where both sides reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasizing the importance of positive trade relations.

          <p>Elon Musk stated he regrets some of his social media posts about President Trump made during a public dispute. The feud dissolved a tight partnership that had propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump's second administration, fueling market concerns over the outlook for Tesla and SpaceX businesses. The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk said undermines the work of DOGE and would substantially increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously indicated there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill.</p>

Anti-Musk activists are planning protests to highlight safety concerns with Tesla's electric vehicles and driver assistance features.
