Scheffler's strong performance included ten birdies, effectively overcoming a double bogey on the 14th hole.

Covert surveillance captured Andrews Jr. conducting brazen drug deals, including exchanging over £100,000 in supermarket bags.

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are set for a Super Bowl rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles, but a revenge victory appears unlikely due to significant roster challenges. The Chiefs' offense is hampered by Rashee Rice's suspension and Xavier Worthy's injury, leaving Patrick Mahomes with a depleted receiving corps and an inconsistent run game. The article highlights the Eagles' strong roster and dominant defense, contrasting with Kansas City's current struggles and potential 1-3 start to the season. Analyst Phoebe Schecter suggests the Chiefs must improve their run game and offensive line to remain competitive in a tough AFC West.</p>

          <p>Australia is investing an initial AU$12 billion ($8 billion) over a decade to upgrade its Henderson shipyard near Perth, transforming it into a maintenance hub for its future nuclear-powered submarine fleet. This substantial investment is part of the AUKUS agreement with the UK and US, aimed at countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The project will create high-security dry docks and facilities for building other naval vessels, supporting around 10,000 local jobs. US President Trump's administration is currently reviewing the AUKUS pact, but Australia anticipates US access to the new facilities.</p>
