          <p>Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) presented a significant software update, termed Liquid Glass, that will revamp the look of Apple's devices, marking the first major redesign of the iPhone operating system since 2013. The new design language will affect iPhones, Macs, and Vision Pro headsets, with a focus on fluid animations and a glass-like aesthetic. However, the unveiling underwhelmed Wall Street, as investors sought more substantial advancements in Apple's artificial intelligence strategy to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed the release of Apple Intelligence, its AI response to ChatGPT, citing the need for more time to meet quality standards.</p>
