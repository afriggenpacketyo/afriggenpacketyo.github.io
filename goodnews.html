          <p>A China-led international research team analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. The study, published in National Science Review, indicates that this underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. This discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. The research offers new insights into the red planet's geological composition and its capacity to support life.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli for governor of New Jersey, calling him a "terrific America First Candidate." Ciattarelli, who previously criticized Trump, has now aligned himself with the former president.

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has placed India in a tight spot, as India has historically opposed third-party mediation. The offer follows a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. after cross-border clashes. While Pakistan welcomed Trump's offer, India views it as an attempt to internationalize the Kashmir dispute, especially after India's 2019 decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The situation has sparked debate in India regarding diplomatic channels and potential third-party involvement.</p>
