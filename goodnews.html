The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing significant improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance division. CEO David Joyner credited the positive results to a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna and new technology enhancing pharmacy efficiency. This performance marks a positive turn under Joyner, who took over as CEO amid struggles to boost profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not view artificial superintelligence as an imminent threat to his company's future. He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. The design software company, which recently priced its IPO at $33 per share, is valued at $19.3 billion. Field's comments come as other tech giants like Meta are heavily investing in the pursuit of superintelligence.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026, ending months of speculation about her next political move. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, though she intends to remain active in politics. This decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. A source close to Harris indicated she felt her heart wasn't in a gubernatorial run and that she can have a greater impact on the national stage.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The FA had accused the Brazilian international of deliberately getting booked in four separate Premier League matches to influence betting markets, a charge that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found to be "not proven," the commission did find Paqueta guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. A sanction for these breaches will be decided at a later date.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new bank branch since beginning a major expansion in 2018, a milestone marked with a ceremony in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The strategy contrasts with the broader industry trend of branch closures since the 2008 financial crisis. The bank plans to open another 500 new locations by 2027, aiming to capture more deposits and serve a larger portion of the U.S. population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst estimates, causing its stock to rise despite a net loss of 226,000 broadband customers. The company's performance was bolstered by growth in its mobile business, which added a record 378,000 lines, and strong results from its theme parks and film studio. While the broadband losses were better than feared, they reflect ongoing intense competition from fixed wireless providers. Executives expressed confidence in a new market strategy, including new pricing plans, aimed at stabilizing the crucial broadband segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif proposes the creation of a Middle East network for peaceful nuclear research, named Menara. He argues that after decades of stalled progress on making the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, a new approach focused on cooperation is essential for stability. The proposed body would be open to all regional states that reject nuclear weapons and would facilitate shared advancements in nuclear energy, medicine, and agriculture under mutual verification. Zarif contends this is a necessary step to move beyond mistrust and prevent a catastrophic regional conflict.</p>
