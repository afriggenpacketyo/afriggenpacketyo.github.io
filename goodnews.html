          <p>The U.S. has reversed its policy restricting the export of semiconductor design software to China, according to major firms like Synopsys and Cadence. The companies are now working to restore access for their Chinese customers, complying with the updated U.S. export laws. This move follows a ban implemented in May and affects key players in the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market, signaling a potential de-escalation in a specific area of trade friction.</p>

          <p>Amid narrow legislative margins, this article explains the rules governing a tie vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can break a tie, the House has no such mechanism; a tied vote on any question means the motion or bill automatically fails. This procedural detail has gained relevance due to the Republican's slim majority, where a few defections can easily lead to a legislative stalemate on the floor.</p>
