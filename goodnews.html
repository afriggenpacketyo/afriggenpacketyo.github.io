          <p>Former President Joe Biden is moving forward with plans to establish his presidential library in his home state of Delaware, appointing a 13-person board to lead the project. The board, composed of former aides and political allies, faces the significant challenge of fundraising in a fragmented political climate and with a new administration in the White House. The project's team is in the early planning stages, with construction and programming to be funded by private donations.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes national seashore after a multi-million dollar buyout deal led to the departure of 12 organic dairy operations. The Nature Conservancy will now lead a five-year restoration effort on over 16,000 acres, aiming to restore native grasslands and improve biodiversity. The plan controversially includes using targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plant species, creating a living laboratory for conservation techniques amid lingering community tensions over the loss of historic ranches.</p>

A high-ranking Italian bishop celebrated Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing the Jubilee's theme of restoring dignity to the marginalized, a moment that drew a standing ovation. Many attendees credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming environment, a stark contrast to previous years when such groups faced exclusion.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing the use of Yondr pouches, a locked magnetic case, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches, which they carry throughout the day but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. While educators report a positive increase in student engagement and social interaction, the system has received mixed reactions from students, some of whom have attempted to bypass the restriction.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes, in a South Carolina forest.

The project aims to connect the remains to living descendants, with the goal of restoring the names and stories of some of America's first soldiers.</p>
