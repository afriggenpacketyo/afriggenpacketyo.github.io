        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following five days of intense fighting that resulted in at least 33 deaths, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who mediated the talks after pressure from the U.S. government, which linked future tariff negotiations to the cessation of hostilities. Tensions had escalated over a long-standing border dispute, leading to military confrontations and the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians. Both nations have pledged to honor the ceasefire and work towards de-escalation, though deep mistrust remains.</p>

          <p>Roy Cooper, the popular former two-term Democratic governor of North Carolina, has officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. He will seek the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis in the 2026 midterm elections. Cooper's entry is considered a significant boost for Democrats' hopes of flipping the Republican-held seat and narrowing the GOP's majority in the Senate. He is expected to face Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who has received a strong endorsement from Donald Trump, setting the stage for a highly competitive and expensive race.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant trade deal with the European Union following a meeting with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen at his Scottish golf resort. The framework agreement sets a 15% tariff rate for most EU imports, including vehicles, averting a potential trade war where Trump had threatened a 30% blanket tariff. In return, the EU has agreed to purchase substantial amounts of U.S. military hardware and energy, and to increase investment in the U.S. The deal also opens all 27 EU nations to American products with zero tariffs, aiming to bring stability to the $2 trillion annual trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup Z.ai has announced a new open-source artificial intelligence model, GLM-4.5, which it claims is cheaper to operate than the breakthrough model from its competitor, DeepSeek. The company stated its new model is built on "agentic" AI, which autonomously breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts for more accurate completion. Z.ai claims the model requires only eight of Nvidia's H20 chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls. This development continues the trend of Chinese firms rapidly advancing in the AI space, creating powerful and cost-effective alternatives to Western models.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), are looking to capitalize on newfound momentum after all 24 of their targeted lawmakers survived a recent recall vote. The result is viewed as a significant political setback for President William Lai Ching-te's ruling party, which had supported the recall effort. Observers note that the failed recall has re-energized the opposition and strengthened the informal "Blue-White" alliance between the KMT and TPP. This success is expected to bolster their position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the performance of India's new cricket captain, Shubman Gill, during a grueling fourth Test match against England in Manchester. Despite immense pressure and early setbacks, Gill's defiant batting performance, which included a century, was instrumental in securing a draw and preventing an English series victory. The author suggests this display of grit and leadership, in his first tour as captain and without several veteran players, could be a formative experience for the 25-year-old. While noting some tactical areas for improvement, the piece praises Gill's character and suggests he has the potential to lead the next generation of Indian cricketers effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address its ongoing demographic crisis, China has announced its first-ever national childcare subsidy program. The government will provide an annual payment of 3,600 yuan for every child born on or after January 1, 2025, until they reach the age of three. This policy is a significant step by policymakers to directly support households and encourage more births to counter a declining population, which poses a long-term threat to economic growth. However, some economists believe the subsidy amount is too small to have a substantial immediate impact on either the birth rate or household spending.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have successfully observed tidal disruption events—where black holes tear apart and consume stars—that were previously hidden by dense galactic dust. These observations were made possible by detecting the infrared light emitted when radiation from the event heats the surrounding dust. The study provides new evidence that so-called "dormant" black holes are more active than previously thought, occasionally feeding on passing stars. This new method opens up possibilities for studying a greater number of these rare events and gaining a better understanding of black holes and their galactic environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the reasons why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive than others, often feeling deeply hurt by minor slights or comments. Experts explain that this trait can stem from a combination of genetic predisposition, known as being a highly sensitive person, and life experiences like childhood trauma, which can lead to rejection sensitivity. While being attuned to emotions has its benefits, it can also disrupt social connections if not managed. The piece offers coping strategies, such as challenging worst-case-scenario thinking and discerning whose opinions truly matter, to help sensitive individuals navigate their feelings in a healthier way.</p>

          <p>U.S. defense company Auterion announced it will provide Ukraine with 33,000 artificial intelligence guidance kits for its drones, funded by a $50 million Pentagon contract. These advanced kits enable manually operated strike drones to autonomously track and engage targets up to a kilometer away. This technology is a key part of Ukraine's strategy to counter Russia's increasingly effective signal-jamming capabilities, which can disable standard drones. The deployment represents a more than tenfold increase in this type of support from Auterion, significantly boosting Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe housing shortage and rising rents, Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) law to accelerate building projects. The proposed legislation would allow municipalities to bypass complex planning laws and expedite approvals for new residential construction. The plan aims to address a crisis driven by rising material costs, high interest rates, and bureaucratic delays, which have hampered the country's ability to meet its housing targets. While the construction industry welcomes the move as a positive step, some economists and environmentalists have expressed skepticism, questioning its short-term effectiveness and potential environmental impact.</p>

          <p>This advice column explores the philosophy of Ruth Chang to help with difficult life decisions, such as choosing between a high-paying corporate job and morally fulfilling but lower-paying nonprofit work. Chang argues that hard choices are not hard because one option is secretly better, but because the options are "on a par"—they are in the same league of value but offer different kinds of value. In these moments, external reasons run out, and individuals must exercise their own power to create reasons for themselves. By making a committed choice, one actively defines the kind of person they want to be.</p>

In contrast, the moon will be much dimmer for the peak of two other showers, the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids, on the night of July 29-30. Together, these two events could produce 20 to 30 meteors per hour under dark skies, offering a better viewing opportunity.</p>
