        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, while Japan's aid was estimated at $16.8 billion, a decrease mainly attributed to the yen's depreciation. The decline contrasted with sharp increases in previous years due to resumed development projects after COVID-19 suspensions. Japan views ODA as a key diplomatic tool, but faces fiscal constraints. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>
