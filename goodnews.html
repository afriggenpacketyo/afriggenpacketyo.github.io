          <p>Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, 94, announced his retirement at the company's annual shareholder meeting, naming Greg Abel as his successor. Buffett expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead the company and stated he has no intention of selling his shares, believing Berkshire's prospects are better under Abel's management. During the meeting, Buffett also warned about the potential dire global consequences of Donald Trump's tariffs, emphasizing that trade should not be used as a weapon and advocating for international cooperation and trade. The announcement came as a surprise, as Buffett had previously indicated no plans to retire. </p>

          <p>Dannielynn Birkhead, the 18-year-old daughter of Anna Nicole Smith, wore one of her late mother's dresses to the Barnstable Brown Gala at the Kentucky Derby, an event where her father, Larry Birkhead, met Anna Nicole in 2003. The black dress with sparkling diamonds across the back was originally worn by Anna Nicole 21 years ago. Dannielynn stated that wearing the dress made her feel closer to her mother, who died in 2007 when Dannielynn was just 5 months old, and she completed her look with a signature blonde updo and red lip. Attending the Kentucky Derby festivities is an annual tradition for Dannielynn and Birkhead.</p>

          <h2>California Democrats Debate Mandatory Retirement Age for Politicians</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is considering a resolution to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local elected officials, spurred by concerns over leaders remaining in power past their prime. The proposal, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, reflects broader anxieties about age and leadership, particularly after the struggles of Senator Dianne Feinstein and former President Joseph R. Biden. While some argue it's ageist and discriminatory, others believe it's necessary to make way for younger candidates and ensure effective governance. The resolution will be debated at the upcoming state convention, though its chances of becoming law are slim.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, the Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii, has recorded a detailed image of a cluster of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope the VTF will help predict powerful solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) said the image was taken during technical testing, but it demonstrates the instrument's potential. Researchers emphasize the importance of predicting these storms to mitigate damage to Earth's infrastructure.</p>

Vardy, who is leaving Leicester after 13 years, expressed his deep connection to the club and his desire to reach 200 goals before his departure.</p>

          <p>As official research positions are lost to budget cuts, citizen scientists are playing an increasingly vital role in preserving federal forests.

The work of these volunteers supplements underfunded government programs, helping to save forests at risk from climate change and invasive species. The article highlights the importance of community involvement in conservation efforts as federal agencies face staffing shortages and budget limitations.</p>

The election was fought against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis and shifting demographics, with energy policy and inflation being major concerns. Albanese accused the opposition of mimicking U.S. President Trump's divisive politics, while also noting improved relations with China.</p>
