          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a sophisticated cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The retailer estimates a ¬£300 million reduction in profits for the current year, which is more than analysts anticipated. The cyber-attack initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, and M&S believes the ransomware attack was executed by Scattered Spider, a cyber-crime service. Despite the disruption, M&S CEO Stuart Machin remains optimistic about the company's long-term plans for reshaping the business for customers, colleagues, and shareholders.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo has revealed internal disagreements within the Labour party regarding tax policy, specifically between Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The memo reportedly urged Reeves to consider raising taxes by ¬£3-4 billion annually through various measures, which Reeves did not implement, opting instead for welfare cuts. The proposals included increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. The Conservatives have seized on the memo, accusing Labour of planning future tax increases, while Labour maintains unity behind its economic plan.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, building immunity to multiple types of venom. His unusual hobby has sparked interest from researchers who hope to develop a universal antivenom using his blood. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom. Friede's case offers hope for a synthesized treatment effective against various snake venoms.</p>

          <p>The election of an American Pope, Leo XIV, has stirred controversy among Maga Catholics, who view him with skepticism due to his perceived progressive leanings. This new Pope's choice of name is a sign that he recognizes the scale and the novelty of the challenge that the rightwing populist turn represents. Julian Coman writes that Pope Leo XIV's papacy may lead to a clash between the Vatican and Trumpian nationalism, particularly concerning issues like migration, economic populism, and global cooperation. The article suggests that Pope Leo XIV intends to address global crises such as inequality, climate change, and migration, potentially challenging the Maga worldview.</p>

Governors Andy Beshear and Tim Walz, along with Senator Ruben Gallego, are among those who have indicated their interest in a White House bid. This shift reflects a changing dynamic in American politics, where potential candidates are more forthcoming about their aspirations. Despite the early declarations, many contenders face challenges including low name recognition and fundraising hurdles, as the field of potential candidates is expected to narrow significantly before the actual election.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark about never having to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts from supporters, at a time when consumers are facing soaring rice prices.

The incident has further damaged Ishiba's already low approval ratings ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections. The rice shortage has been attributed to various factors, including decades-old policies and recent weather conditions, prompting the government to release rice from emergency stockpiles.</p>
