          <p>A retired grandfather's life was drastically altered when persistent heartburn and nausea were diagnosed as mesenteric ischemia, a rare and serious condition caused by restricted blood flow to the small intestine. After losing significant weight and struggling to eat, Ed Langevin underwent a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in a blocked artery, which immediately restored his quality of life. His story highlights the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare, as his initial symptoms were not immediately identified. Now fully recovered, he is back to enjoying his family and favorite foods.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German states are updating their centuries-old burial laws to reflect changing societal attitudes, with Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt leading the reforms. The new legislation permits novel practices such as river burials in the Rhine, allowing relatives to keep urns at home, and creating "memorial diamonds" from cremated ashes. These changes cater to a growing demand for more personalized and secular memorial options, driven by increased mobility and a shift away from traditional cemetery burials. While welcomed by funeral directors, the reforms have drawn criticism from Christian churches concerned about the dignity of the deceased's remains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help car shoppers manage costs and avoid debt, financial experts suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline for affordability. This framework recommends making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring total monthly transportation costs do not exceed 10% of your income. Following this rule can help prevent becoming "upside down" on a loan, where you owe more than the car is worth. While high car prices can make it challenging to follow strictly, it serves as a valuable tool for budgeting a major purchase. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a thought-provoking paradigm for understanding U.S.-China dynamics, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China has learned from the U.S. for decades, it is now time for America to learn from China's successes in areas like infrastructure, mass transit, and manufacturing. Wang observes that China's leadership is dominated by engineers focused on physical dynamism, whereas America's is led by lawyers. However, he also critiques the engineering state's focus on national power over individual happiness, which has contributed to issues like high youth unemployment.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Currently moving northwest over open waters, the system poses no immediate threat to land. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict Gabrielle will continue to strengthen, likely reaching hurricane status by Sunday as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its path is expected to keep it away from the U.S. mainland, the storm could bring some impacts to Bermuda early next week as it intensifies.</p>

          <h2>Lessons from a California Home That Generates More Energy Than It Consumes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A remodeled home in Hermosa Beach, California, serves as a case study for achieving net-zero energy consumption for less than the cost of a standard renovation. The "Green Idea House" utilizes off-the-shelf technologies, including rooftop solar panels, an induction stove, and efficient heat pump water heaters, to eliminate fossil fuel use. The design also incorporates passive energy-saving features like strategic roof overhangs for shade and an open stairway that acts as a "thermal chimney" for cooling. The project demonstrates that while it requires significant planning and homeowner dedication, building an environmentally friendly and cost-saving home is an achievable goal.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers, leaving behind a legacy of remarkable excellence and franchise revival. Kershaw was a constant force for the team through its most difficult periods, including bankruptcy, before becoming the centerpiece of its modern dynasty. His career, which includes three Cy Young awards and a career ERA lower than Cy Young's himself, is distinguished by his role in guiding the team back to prominence. On the night after his announcement, the Dodgers clinched their 13th consecutive postseason berth, a testament to the winning culture he helped build.</p>

          <p>Edible insects like hairy caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are both a traditional delicacy and a vital food source in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sold in bustling Kinshasa markets, these insects offer a high-protein, organic alternative to more expensive meats in a country where two-thirds of the population lives in poverty. While some find the practice squeamish, many Congolese prize the insects for their nutritional value and taste. NGOs are now promoting the commercial farming of larvae to provide a sustainable food source for orphanages and the wider population, addressing food scarcity and nutritional needs.</p>

          <h2>Producer David E. Kelley Commits to Filming in Los Angeles, Bucking Out-of-State Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prolific television producer David E. Kelley is doubling down on filming in California, a significant move as many productions leave the state for better tax incentives elsewhere. Despite challenges, including recent wildfires that impacted his crew, Kelley's company is keeping all its current projects, such as "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," based in Los Angeles. This decision is driven by a desire to support the local industry and community that has been central to his long career. The choice was solidified by a recently expanded state film and TV tax credit program, which is helping to bring more production work back to California.</p>
