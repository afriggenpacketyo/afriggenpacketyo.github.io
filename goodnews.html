          <h2>Google to Pay Texas $1.4 Billion in Data Privacy Settlement</h2>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected user data. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement resolves allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. The company asserts that policy changes related to these allegations were previously announced or implemented.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March, stemming from an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. The judge emphasized that the op-ed was the only evidence presented against her, and there was no indication of violence or advocacy for violence. Tufts University expressed pleasure at her release and welcomed her back to campus.</p>

          <h2>Trump Defends Raising Taxes on Wealthiest Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 19:17:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump expressed openness to raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to provide tax breaks for lower-income earners, framing it as "good politics." He dismissed comparisons to George H.W. Bush's broken promise of "no new taxes," arguing that Bush's loss was due to Ross Perot. Trump suggested that a small tax increase for the rich to benefit lower-income workers could be acceptable, despite potential criticism from Democrats. The comments come as Republicans seek ways to extend the 2017 tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Omada Health, a virtual care company specializing in chronic conditions, has filed for an IPO amid a turbulent economy.

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks, traders said, as heat threatens to damage crops in China‚Äôs agricultural heartlands.

Earlier this week, Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning as hot, dry weather threatened the wheat growing in its fields.</p>

He was captured in Mexico in March and deported to Guatemala, and the U.S. embassy in Guatemala City described his handover as the country's "most important extradition in decades" to the United States. A federal indictment accused him of trafficking cocaine into the U.S. from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico between 2006 and 2016.</p>

          <p>Jack Katz, a comic-book artist and writer known for his 768-page magnum opus, ‚ÄúThe First Kingdom,‚Äù died at 97. Katz's death was confirmed by a friend, Brian Miller. Published in installments over a dozen years starting in 1974, ‚ÄúThe First Kingdom‚Äù is widely credited with helping give birth to the long-form graphic novel. The story is a sprawling blend of fantasy and science fiction with philosophical underpinnings, beginning after a nuclear apocalypse, as small bands of humans try to survive among dinosaurlike mutants, monsters, gods and other fantastical beings.</p>
