          <p>In Inner Mongolia's Yimin open-pit coal mine, China is deploying a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks. This represents the world‚Äôs largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks and highlights China‚Äôs commitment to upgrading traditional industries with advanced technologies, particularly as the nation faces a shrinking labor force and an aging population. The Yimin mine previously required 1,200 drivers working around the clock, but faced a shortage of drivers due to dangerous conditions and declining interest among younger generations. The initiative aligns with China‚Äôs push to digitally transform its coal industry, identifying autonomous driving as a strategic goal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has saved over $5 million annually by identifying and cutting thousands of unused software licenses across various agencies. For instance, the IRS was paying for 3,000 software licenses but only using 25, leading DOGE to cut 99% of the unused licenses. Similar cuts were made at the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission, saving taxpayers money. Elon Musk, who is stepping down as the face of DOGE, stated that the savings will continue to build, and he is confident total cuts will amount to $1 trillion in the coming years.</p>

He emphasized that this investment is the largest in Pennsylvania's history and will ensure U.S. Steel workers retain their jobs.

          <p>An appeals court denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, maintaining a pause on Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts. The court ruled that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. This decision upholds a previous injunction issued by a California judge, questioning the legality of the administration's efforts to pare the federal workforce. The administration had sought to implement large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans.</p>

The government is preparing to unveil its strategic defence review, outlining priorities for military and security spending.
