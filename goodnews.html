          <p>A temporary restraining order on President Donald Trump's proclamation barring foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. will remain in effect until next Monday. Judge Allison Burroughs is considering arguments for a preliminary injunction, with Harvard's lawyers arguing that the proclamation violates its First Amendment rights. The government argued that it does not trust Harvard to monitor foreigners and raised concerns about the university's foreign entanglements with the Chinese government. Harvard filed the lawsuit after the Department of Homeland Security announced it was canceling the school's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Investing Club discusses Eaton's acquisition of Ultra Precision Control Systems, an aerospace and defense firm, for $1.55 billion. This move diversifies Eaton's portfolio beyond its data center business, addressing concerns about its close ties to AI data center spending. Ultra PCS, which makes products like ejection systems and noise control for aircraft, is projected to generate $240 million in sales in 2025. The acquisition is expected to boost Eaton's aerospace business and broaden the way Wall Street views the stock, which is up more than 4% following the announcement.</p>

          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65 can provide substantial monthly income, but the exact amount varies based on gender, life expectancy, interest rate environment, annuity type, and optional features.

These payments are shaped by several key factors, including gender and life expectancy, interest rate environment, annuity type and structure, and optional features.
