          <p>The FDA has approved Yeztugo, the first twice-yearly injectable medication to prevent HIV, developed by Gilead Sciences. This HIV-1 capsid inhibitor reduces the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults and adolescents, demonstrating nearly 100% effectiveness in clinical trials. The drug, administered as a subcutaneous injection, offers a more convenient alternative to daily oral medications. Common side effects reported during trials include injection site reactions, headache, and nausea, but the medication is considered a significant breakthrough in the fight against HIV.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. The changes scrap property size and energy score requirements, allowing 2.7 million additional homes, including those with children, to benefit. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to slight increases in customer bills, although the government anticipates savings from expenditure cuts will offset these rises. While debt charities welcome the move, some argue that the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means tested benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States added approximately 379,000 new millionaires in 2024, totaling 23.8 million, according to a UBS report. This increase is attributed to a strong performance on Wall Street and a stable U.S. dollar. However, the first half of 2025 has been more turbulent due to trade war concerns and recession fears, impacting the dollar. Despite these challenges, American real estate has remained resilient, and U.S. equities could potentially end the year with a slight increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students at universities should be prepared to encounter views they may find shocking or offensive, according to Arif Ahmed from the Office for Students (OfS). New guidelines are being issued to universities in England to protect free speech and academic freedom, requiring institutions to uphold these principles. The OfS can impose significant fines on universities that fail to comply with the new law. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, emphasizing that anything can be discussed or taught within legal boundaries.</p>

He proposes developing "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous AI designed to predict whether another AI's action would cause harm and block it if it is too risky. Bengio's plan stems from his disillusionment with current AI systems and his concern about the potential for AI agents to escape human control. He believes that governments and companies should prioritize AI safety and ethical considerations.</p>
