          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has unveiled a new, alternate cover for her upcoming album, "Man's Best Friend," which she humorously described as "approved by God." This decision follows significant online criticism of the original cover art, which some users found to be dehumanizing and tone-deaf. In recent interviews, Carpenter has addressed the intense scrutiny female artists face regarding their creative choices, from song lyrics to fashion. She defended her artistic expression, stating that she embraces her femininity and that her stage outfits help her feel comfortable while performing, despite occasional criticism from the public.</p>

After the fight, Paul expressed that this victory marked the true beginning of his boxing career, as he feels he is now a legitimate fighter and no longer just a social media personality.

          <p>Tijuana's Kenia Enr√≠quez, an interim world champion boxer with the WBC, has signed an exclusive multi-fight contract with the mixed martial arts organization Combate Global. Enr√≠quez, who holds a 28-1 boxing record, made the move after expressing frustration with the WBC for not providing a path to unify her title against the current champion. She accuses the boxing organization of protecting its champion and disrespecting her accomplishments in the ring. Having already made a successful MMA debut in March, Enr√≠quez sees Combate Global as an ideal new home that offers the opportunities and respect she feels were lacking in boxing.</p>

          <p>As heatwaves become more common, animal welfare experts are issuing urgent pleas for dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. Owners are advised to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water. If a dog shows signs of distress, it should be moved to a cool area and have cool water poured over its body before being taken to a vet immediately.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached for a "group of very wealthy people" to acquire the U.S. operations of the popular video app TikTok. Speaking to Fox News, Trump stated he would reveal the buyer's identity in about two weeks and suggested that the deal would likely require approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes after the U.S. government ordered TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American operations last year due to national security concerns over user data. The deadline for the sale has been extended multiple times, with the current one set for September 17.</p>

This decision marks a strategic shift for Baidu, which previously favored a proprietary model, and puts pressure on closed-source competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. Analysts believe that by offering a powerful model at a lower cost, Baidu could accelerate AI development and change the pricing dynamics of the industry. The move has raised questions about market trust and data security, but it undeniably signals an escalation in the competition for AI dominance between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>
