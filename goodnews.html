          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the first repatriation of its kind. The remains, taken during the 19th and 20th centuries for research, were held by three Japanese institutions. This repatriation is part of a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad, with Australia having worked to retrieve over 1,785 sets of remains from overseas in the last 30 years. The return allows for pathways to healing for generations of the Kaurna people, whose ancestors' remains were collected without consent. </p>

          <p>The appearance of a senior Taiwanese officer at a military exercise in Alaska has garnered attention, suggesting closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force's flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involves 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, and other countries.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The policy change, which could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars, was deemed arbitrary and capricious by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani. The NSF's move was challenged by universities arguing it threatened critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The ruling protects indirect costs, such as building maintenance, from being capped at 15% of direct research costs.</p>
