        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, which affirms standard industry practices for corporate mergers and acquisitions. The company anticipates some workforce reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their recent performance at the Glastonbury festival. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, detectives determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for any offense. The investigation was initiated after the group, known for its pro-Palestinian stance, made controversial on-stage comments. A separate investigation into comments made by the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan during their set is reportedly still ongoing.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analysts Debate Merits of Silver as an Alternative to Gold Amid Price Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:00:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of silver surging to its highest point in over a decade, some investors are considering it as a more affordable alternative to gold for portfolio diversification. The article explores the potential benefits, noting that silver offers similar protections against inflation at a fraction of the cost of gold, which is trading at record highs. However, it cautions against a complete switch, highlighting gold's historical stability and superior value. The piece advises that a balanced approach, possibly reallocating a portion of a portfolio's precious metals holdings, may be the most prudent strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has indicated that it is highly unlikely Chinese-funded factories operating in Mexico will lose their preferential trade status under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor, stated that there are no signs of restrictions targeting Chinese companies ahead of the trade deal's review next year. He suggested that any revisions to the USMCA would probably focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for products, rather than excluding specific countries from its benefits. This provides a degree of stability for Chinese firms with supply chains in Mexico.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly enacted legislation includes a provision for "no tax on tips," but significant questions remain about its application. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped income, effective from 2025 through 2028. Critical details, such as which specific occupations qualify for the break, are still pending clarification from the IRS, which is expected in October. Tax professionals note that the requirement for tips to be "properly reported" could also create complexities for workers, especially those in the gig economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the various factors that influence the price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation.

Other key drivers include inflation rates, central bank policies, and the strength of the U.S. dollar, in which gold is priced. The piece notes that while gold's value is historically stable, its price is subject to constant short-term fluctuations, making it important for potential investors to monitor these market dynamics.

          <p>With the U.S. inflation rate rising to 2.7% in June, the likelihood of immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts has diminished, creating a continued high-rate environment for savers. This article suggests that investing in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) could be a strategic way to capitalize on the current climate, offering both attractive returns and flexibility. A short-term CD allows savers to lock in high rates for periods of a year or less, providing time to assess the economic landscape without committing funds long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the highly competitive streaming market, media companies are increasingly recognizing the strategic value of children's content for retaining subscribers. Shows like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" drive high engagement because children tend to rewatch content repeatedly, which helps reduce customer churn—a critical factor for profitability. Unlike expensive, high-profile series, kids' programming is often less costly to produce and has a longer shelf life. As a result, services like Disney+ and Netflix are leveraging their deep libraries of family-friendly content to maintain a stable subscriber base.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center indicates that President Trump's newly signed tax law will provide savings for all income groups, but higher-income households will benefit the most. The law extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. The report found that approximately 60% of the tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners, who will see an average tax cut of over $12,500. In contrast, households in the bottom quintile will save an average of about $150. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The diagnosis was made after the president noticed swelling in his legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign and occurs when veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs. The doctor's note confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and stated that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to sign winger Bryan Mbeumo after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid for the Cameroon international. The deal, which could rise to £70 million with add-ons, will make the 25-year-old Brentford's biggest-ever sale. Mbeumo is expected to become United's third major signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. The versatile forward, who can play centrally or on the wing, is valued for his proven Premier League experience, work rate, and goal-scoring ability, fitting into new manager Ruben Amorim's system.</p>

Bookmakers and public polls alike predict a series victory for the Lions, with many anticipating a 3-0 clean sweep. Australia is contending with injuries to key players, including Rob Valetini and Will Skelton, and is fielding an inexperienced fly-half. While some analysts believe Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt could orchestrate an upset, the consensus is that the Lions' power, creativity, and depth will be too much for the underprepared Australian side.</p>

After reluctantly rejoining a dating app, she connected with a man who seemed to be a perfect match. On their second date, her rescue dog, who was fearful of men, bit him on the leg, drawing blood and making her fear she would never hear from him again. However, he brushed off the incident, and their relationship blossomed, leading to a magical wedding in Hawaii a year later, a story they now jokingly refer to as "love at first bite."</p>
