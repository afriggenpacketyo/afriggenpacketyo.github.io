They credit Karen's strength and determination, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" in the case, for helping them navigate the ordeal. Read's parents acknowledge that her life will never be the same and hope that the truth about O'Keefe's death will eventually be revealed. Despite the acquittal, Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling blocks the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's ruling. The conflict arose after the DHS accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the attempted revocation of its student visa system certification.</p>
