The expected decline is attributed to factors like increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks.

          <p>The new film "F1," directed by Joseph Kosinski, offers a compelling underdog story starring Brad Pitt as an aging driver returning to the sport. The movie focuses on a fictional, struggling team and the internal rivalry between Pitt's veteran character and a younger teammate, played by Damson Idris. Rather than focusing on real-life powerhouse teams like Ferrari, the film explores the human drama within the technocratic and high-pressure environment of Formula One, creating a familiar but engaging sports epic with fidelity to the racing world.</p>
          <p>80/100</p>
