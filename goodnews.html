          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China, stated that Washington and Beijing appear to be on a "creeping path towards some kind of a deal" regarding their trade disputes. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns noted that strong economic self-interest on both sides makes an agreement logical, pushing back on the idea that China has the upper hand in negotiations. His comments provide a cautiously optimistic perspective amid a 90-day trade truce, highlighting the symbiotic nature of the U.S.-China economic relationship. (not investment advice)</p>
