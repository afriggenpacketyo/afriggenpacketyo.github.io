        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Visitor numbers to popular pornography websites in the United Kingdom have significantly decreased since the enforcement of new age verification rules under the Online Safety Act. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that traffic to major sites like Pornhub and XVideos fell by 47% in late July and early August. The new regulations require sites to implement stricter age checks to prevent access by minors. However, the data also indicates a corresponding increase in traffic to smaller, less-regulated sites, and a surge in downloads of VPN apps, which can be used to bypass the new restrictions.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with experts predicting a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, noted that universities are likely to be more flexible with applicants who narrowly miss their grade offers. This consideration is partly due to this cohort having received lower GCSE grades as part of a national effort to curb grade inflation post-pandemic. The results are expected to be broadly similar to last year, marking a return to pre-pandemic grading standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the 2025 Kennedy Center Honorees, naming country star George Strait, actors Michael Crawford and Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, and the rock band KISS. The announcement follows a period of significant change at the cultural institution, where Trump has become chairman of the board after ousting previous members. The administration has criticized the center for being "woke" and has initiated plans for extensive renovations. Trump, who will host the annual awards gala, stated that his leadership is reversing the decline of what he called a "cherished national institution."</p>

Other confirmed candidates include Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and several current Fed officials like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to interview all candidates before presenting a final list to the president, suggesting a decision is not imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced the expansion of its same-day delivery service for fresh groceries, including meat, eggs, and produce, to over 1,000 U.S. cities. The move caused shares of grocery competitors like Kroger and Albertsons to fall, while Costco also saw a slight dip. The service, which will expand further by year's end, is seen as a significant enhancement to the value of an Amazon Prime membership. The expansion is another step in Amazon's strategy to disrupt the grocery sector, leveraging its vast logistics network to offer rapid delivery of perishable goods alongside its other products.

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and potential rate cuts on the horizon, now may be an opportune time for retirees to consider annuities for guaranteed income. This article suggests that the amount to invest depends on personal factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, rather than a fixed rule. Experts often recommend allocating 20% to 50% of a portfolio to cover essential living expenses not met by Social Security or pensions. Locking in an annuity now could secure higher payout rates for life before the Federal Reserve potentially lowers rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FEWS NET, the Famine Early Warning System Network created by the U.S. in 1985, is being brought back online after being halted by the Trump administration. For decades, the system provided crucial data to predict and prevent food crises globally, but it was shut down in January when its parent agency, USAID, was dismantled. Humanitarian aid specialists have greeted the news of its revival with a mix of enthusiasm and caution, raising questions about the quality and effectiveness of the restored system. The shutdown created a significant information gap for aid organizations, potentially impacting regions on the brink of a food crisis, such as Ethiopia.</p>
