          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures to secure a market-leading position, similar to Google's original search engine success. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI models, despite some Wall Street skepticism and current chatbot inaccuracies.

          <h2>An Analysis of Why the Biden Administration Did Not Release the Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the legal and political reasons why the full collection of Jeffrey Epstein investigation files were not released during the Biden presidency. It explains that grand jury testimony, a key part of the files, is legally protected and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances, a hurdle the Trump administration is also now facing. The piece suggests that even if the files were politically damaging to Donald Trump, the Biden administration lacked the unilateral authority to release them. It posits that the information may not have suggested wrongdoing or that releasing it would have violated privacy and legal norms.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages in hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, aiming to attract younger customers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new drinks, including cold brews and fruity refreshers, are inspired by the company's short-lived beverage-focused chain, CosMc's, which was shuttered in May. Instead of operating separate stores, McDonald's will integrate the CosMc's-branded drinks into its main menu, starting in Wisconsin and Colorado. The move is a strategic effort to capitalize on the growing demand for specialty drinks and boost sales.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Despite historical trends showing the president's party typically loses seats, Johnson believes the GOP has strong offensive opportunities, pointing to Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024. He also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting its tax cuts and other provisions would act as "jet fuel" for the economy and be felt positively by voters. He dismissed polling that shows public disapproval of the law as the result of media misinformation.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. The crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere and can withstand immense power levels. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems capable of disabling satellites in orbit. The development addresses a long-standing challenge in laser technology where the intensity of the laser often damages its own optical components.</p>

The deal marks a significant shift for the media giant, with the Ellison family and RedBird Capital now poised to take control and restructure the company. (not investment advice)</p>

While AI-related jobs still constitute a small portion of the overall labor market, their growth is significant. These positions also tend to offer higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles that do not require AI expertise. (not investment advice)</p>
