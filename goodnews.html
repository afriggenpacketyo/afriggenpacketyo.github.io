        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalization is far from dead and is, in fact, flourishing in Asia. He argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while globalization is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws. He also cautions that the benefits of interconnectedness are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also a manifestation of globalization.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz won his second US Open title and sixth Grand Slam overall by defeating rival Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. The 22-year-old Spaniard delivered a dominant performance, showcasing his powerful forehand and strategic variety to win 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. The victory allows Alcaraz to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Sinner, marking a significant moment in their developing rivalry. The match, which was delayed due to heightened security for President Donald Trump's attendance, solidified Alcaraz's status as one of the sport's most formidable young talents.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant economic and cultural resurgence, marked by the return of tourists and a booming market for initial public offerings (IPOs). The city's IPO fundraising in the first half of 2025 was seven times higher than the previous year, positioning it to potentially lead the world in this area. The author argues that despite concerns over the national security law, Hong Kong is benefiting from its unique status as a capitalist hub within China. To secure its future, Beijing is encouraged to support the city as a base for international institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Unseasonably Cool Temperatures and Fog Forecast for Coastal California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 17:18:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Much of coastal California is expected to experience unseasonably cool weather, with temperatures dropping 5 to 15 degrees below normal this week. The forecast includes thick fog, chilly winds, and the possibility of scattered showers, a stark contrast to the typical post-Labor Day heatwaves. This cool-down is attributed to an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific. While Southern California may welcome the relief from recent heat, Bay Area residents face more sweater weather after an already cold summer. The unusual conditions are expected to persist through the week before a potential warm-up over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Germany's national football team defeated Northern Ireland 3-1 in a crucial World Cup qualifying match in Cologne, providing a much-needed victory for manager Julian Nagelsmann. After an early goal from Serge Gnabry was countered by an equalizer from Isaac Price, Germany struggled to regain control. However, second-half goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz ultimately secured the win. Nagelsmann acknowledged the team's struggles but praised the impact of his substitutes. The result keeps Germany's qualification hopes alive ahead of a decisive final match against Slovakia in November.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers across the globe were treated to a total lunar eclipse, a celestial event popularly known as a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon occurs when the Moon passes directly through the Earth's darkest shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a distinct reddish hue. This striking visual effect is the result of sunlight being filtered and refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the lunar surface. The full eclipse was visible in its entirety from numerous countries, captivating observers and photographers who captured images of the captivating display.</p>

The mission, comprising about 20 vessels and 350 activists, aims to deliver humanitarian supplies and "break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza." Addressing supporters, Thunberg condemned what she described as a "genocide" and "mass starvation" occurring in the Palestinian territory. The flotilla will spend several days in Tunisia to load additional aid before continuing its journey. A previous attempt by the group to reach Gaza in June was intercepted by Israeli forces.</p>

The achievement is seen by many, including England's white-ball captain Harry Brook, as a potential turning point that could unlock his full potential. The performance strengthens his case for a significant role in England's future, including the upcoming Ashes series in Australia.</p>

          <p>England football manager Thomas Tuchel has expressed his desire for the team to utilize long throw-ins and long balls as tactical options in the upcoming World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign, Tuchel noted that these direct tactics are valuable in tournament settings and that the team will work on them. This approach marks a potential shift from the style seen under previous manager Gareth Southgate, whose team used a lower percentage of long balls at Euro 2024. Tuchel emphasized that while training time is limited, all tactical patterns, including crosses, will be important for success.</p>

His comments follow increased pressure from Trump on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates.
