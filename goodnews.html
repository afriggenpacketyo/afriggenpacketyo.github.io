          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly frustrated with Meta's position in artificial intelligence, leading the company to invest $14 billion in Scale AI and hire its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead a new AI research lab. Wang is expected to improve Meta's AI execution after the lukewarm reception of its Llama AI models. The deal allows Meta to gain expertise from a prominent AI startup without a direct acquisition, potentially avoiding antitrust concerns. Wang's appointment reflects Zuckerberg's belief in the need for external expertise to bolster Meta's AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and the protection of playtime during school breaks to encourage children to spend less time on screens. The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report calls for an end to "anti-play culture," noting a 50% decline in outdoor play in England due to traffic, crime concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report recommends a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies and protecting play in schools.

The spiral was found in data provided by Oort Cloud expert David Nesvorny and confirmed through simulations on NASA‚Äôs Pleiades Supercomputer. This structure is attributed to the galactic tide, the gravitational field of our galaxy, twisting the orbital planes of small bodies and comets in the Oort Cloud.
