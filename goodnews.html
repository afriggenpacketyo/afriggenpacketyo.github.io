          <h2>General Motors Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates Despite Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 07:40:41 EDT</div>

          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, reporting an adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 against a predicted $2.44. Despite this, the company's net income declined from the previous year, and it affirmed its full-year guidance which accounts for a potential multi-billion dollar impact from U.S. auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated GM is actively working to mitigate its exposure to these tariffs through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The company is navigating significant trade uncertainty while managing its transition toward electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. The company posted an adjusted earnings per share of 87 cents, beating the 83 cents expected. However, global unit case volume, a key indicator of demand, fell by 1%, with declines in North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. This suggests that while European sales are robust, the company faces challenges from economic uncertainty and shifting consumer confidence in other major markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new official photograph of Prince George has been released by his parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, to celebrate his 12th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Josh Shinner in Norfolk, shows the smiling prince in a rural setting. As second in line to the throne, Prince George's life balances royal duties with his parents' efforts to provide a normal childhood. He has recently been seen at public events like Wimbledon and Trooping the Colour, and has also been meeting veterans and attending football matches with his father, Prince William.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. withdraws federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, China has unveiled its next-generation bullet train technology. The new train design overcomes previous speed barriers, achieving speeds above 350km/h while maintaining energy efficiency comparable to older models. Chinese researchers accomplished this by redesigning the train's head shape and undercarriage to significantly reduce aerodynamic drag. This technological advancement showcases China's continued investment and leadership in high-speed rail, creating a stark contrast with the challenges facing similar infrastructure projects in the United States.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of unity, supporters of rival Los Angeles soccer clubs LAFC and the Galaxy set aside their differences to protest federal immigration raids. During a recent match, LAFC fans unveiled a large banner reading "Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido" (Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated), showing solidarity with community members affected by the raids. The gesture comes as many Galaxy fans have been boycotting their own team for its silence on the issue. This action highlights how the immigrant-rich soccer community is responding to policies that they feel personally target their families and neighborhoods.</p>

          <h2>Essay Advocates for Shade as Critical Public Health Infrastructure in a Warming World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global temperatures rise and heat-related deaths increase, this article makes the case for prioritizing shade as essential public health infrastructure. The author argues that reducing emissions is not enough and that societies must adapt to a hotter planet by investing in shade, both natural and artificial. Trees are presented as the most effective and democratic solution, cooling urban environments and fostering public life. Where trees are not viable, other structures like canopies and awnings are vital. The essay concludes that shade is a forgotten natural resource that must be reclaimed as a basic human right.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is emerging as a dominant political force in Washington, seemingly surpassing the influence of other tech giants like Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's success is tied to the critical role of Nvidia's AI chips in the global tech landscape. His recent lobbying efforts reportedly played a key role in the Trump administration's decision to allow the resumption of H20 AI chip sales to China. This growing influence allows Huang to navigate the complex U.S.-China trade relationship, positioning Nvidia favorably while other tech companies face increasing political and regulatory pressures from the administration.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that a significant portion of working-class Trump voters could be persuaded to vote for Democrats in 2028 with the right approach. The analysis indicates that while these voters are often socially moderate or conservative, they hold strongly progressive views on economic issues like raising the minimum wage, protecting jobs, and expanding Social Security. The report identifies that about 11% of working-class Trump voters are "social populists"—socially moderate and economically egalitarian. The author argues that by adopting a populist economic platform and moderating its cultural messaging, the Democratic party could win over this crucial slice of the electorate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a small, wireless device worn on a mother's breast to measure the exact amount of milk a baby consumes during feeding. This innovation aims to alleviate a common source of anxiety for new mothers: uncertainty about whether their infant is getting enough nourishment. The device transmits data to a smartphone, allowing parents to monitor milk flow in real time. Currently in the development and testing phase, the technology is seen as a potential "game-changer" for supporting mothers, improving breastfeeding success rates, and providing valuable data for pediatricians, especially for at-risk infants.</p>

          <p>UCLA researchers have deployed a new network of 20 air pollution monitors across northwest Los Angeles County to provide real-time data on particulate matter. The project was initiated to address community concerns about air quality following the Palisades fire, particularly the amount of ash and dust generated during reconstruction. The sensors track both fine (PM 2.5) and coarser (PM 10) particles, which are linked to various health issues. This hyperlocal network provides data updated every five to ten minutes on a user-friendly online map, helping residents make informed decisions about outdoor activities in the affected areas.</p>
