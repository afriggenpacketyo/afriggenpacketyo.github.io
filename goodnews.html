          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, which will allow taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. Abbott hailed the bill as a victory for Texas families and school children, emphasizing that it ensures students have the freedom to seek the educational option best suited for them. Democrats, however, argue that the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already attending private institutions. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most private school students and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities.</p>
