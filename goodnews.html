          <p>The article discusses the rise of AI tools in parenting, such as party planners and chatbots, and their potential impact on the parent-child relationship. While these tools promise to optimize parenting, they risk undermining its intimacy and humanness. The author argues that outsourcing parenting to AI can lead to missed opportunities for connection and care. Human interaction and tacit knowledge are essential for raising children, and relying on AI can encourage a do-it-all model of parenthood that demands more from parents.
