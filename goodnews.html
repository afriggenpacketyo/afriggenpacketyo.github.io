          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to intensify tariff talks, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. Following meetings between Japanese and U.S. officials in Washington, both countries plan to hold intense ministerial discussions starting in mid-May, preceded by working-level talks. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that they managed to deepen discussions on nontariff barriers and economic security cooperation. Japan hopes the U.S. will remove auto tariffs and is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice.</p>
