          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials who are responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States. The policy targets those who issue or threaten arrest warrants against U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts, as well as officials who demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies that extend into the U.S. Rubio emphasized that free speech is a birthright and foreign governments have no authority over it. The exact implementation of the policy remains to be seen, but it is likely to affect officials from countries with a history of targeting dual nationals for online criticism.</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a significant increase despite the company's decision to slash its profit outlook due to tariffs, which are expected to impact its business by $50 million.

Despite the lowered guidance, Abercrombie reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and raised its full-year sales guidance.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only as one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its structure, where existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself.

This structure, where more shares come from investors than the company, is rare in tech IPOs with Facebook being a notable exception.

          <p>The film "Friendship" explores the theme of male loneliness through the character of Craig Waterman, played by Tim Robinson, who struggles to make and maintain friendships. The film traces Craig's attempts to bond with his neighbor Austin, played by Paul Rudd, and the bizarre lengths he goes to in order to gain approval. The film is directed by Andrew DeYoung, and the techniques used shroud the story in suspense: dramatic cinematography, slow zooms, and an off-putting lo-fi score. Ultimately, the movie fearlessly reckons with how confounding people can be in their bid for one another's approval.</p>

A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, more than an income of $500,000 or assets of $1 million. Having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, such as a surprise car repair or medical bill. The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor. (not investment advice)</p>
