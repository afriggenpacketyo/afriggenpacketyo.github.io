          <p>This article highlights a stark contrast in climate policy between the U.S. and China, with President Trump dismissing climate change as a "con job" while President Xi Jinping unveils ambitious strategies for a climate-proof future. China aims to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase non-fossil fuels to over 30% of its energy mix, focusing on wind and solar. Driven by data on rising risks of extreme weather, Beijing is re-engineering urban landscapes for resilience, viewing the transition to green energy as an economic imperative and "the trend of the time." This proactive approach positions China as a leader in climate adaptation and sustainable development.</p>

          <p>In the latest episode of "The Celebrity Traitors," pressure mounted on the faithful contestants as they continued to struggle in identifying the traitors, leading to another faithful's "murder." Presenter Claudia Winkleman expressed frustration over the loss of seven faithfuls, while cracks began to show within the treacherous trio of Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns. Suspicions increasingly fell on Jonathan Ross, with Burns herself turning on him and social media users demanding his banishment. The episode concluded with a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable, leaving the banishment "to the hands of fate" and highlighting the faithfuls' ongoing difficulties.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a surprising third-quarter profit and projected record revenue for the final three months of the year, driven by stronger travel demand and higher fares. The carrier expects unit revenue to increase by 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% year-over-year, assuming demand remains robust. Despite earlier cuts to its 2025 profit forecast, the company reaffirmed its earnings outlook. Southwest is also implementing changes, such as abandoning open seating, to enhance competitiveness and boost sales, with increased revenue from seat assignments expected in the first quarter of the new year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is actively defending its decision to demolish the East Wing for a new ballroom by emphasizing a "proud presidential legacy" of extensive renovations and expansions to the complex. The administration highlights historical changes, such as Thomas Jefferson's colonnades, James Monroe's South Portico, and Theodore Roosevelt's West Wing, many of which faced contemporary criticism for cost or design. This article details how past presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, also undertook significant, sometimes controversial, construction projects, framing the current demolition as part of a long-standing tradition of adapting the presidential residence. The defense aims to contextualize the current project within a history of evolving White House architecture.</p>

Goodell defended the decision by citing the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist's immense global popularity. Bad Bunny, known for his opposition to Trump and his policies, performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl. Goodell expressed confidence that the performance would be a "great show" and a "united moment," despite the backlash. The commissioner emphasized the importance of the Super Bowl stage for entertainment value, prioritizing the artist's broad appeal.</p>

          <h2>Former Biden Officials Advocate for U.S. Hi-Tech Industrial Policy Over Broad Manufacturing Revival</h2>

          <p>Former Biden administration officials are advocating for the U.S. to focus its industrial policy on strategic, cutting-edge technologies rather than a wholesale revival of manufacturing, particularly in sectors where the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage. Former Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo emphasized that industrial policy is crucial for national security in areas like semiconductors, as exemplified by the Chips Act. This perspective contrasts with the current administration's broader "make everything in America" stance. The debate reflects how the U.S. should compete with China's state-led advanced manufacturing initiatives in future industries like AI, robotics, and biotech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser, positioning ChatGPT as a central mechanism for internet surfing, capable of pulling information from "browser memories" and even booking vacations in "agent" mode. While CEO Sam Altman touts it as a "once-a-decade opportunity" to rethink browsers, the article notes the experience feels largely similar to existing browsers, primarily integrating ChatGPT more deeply into daily web use. This commercial expansion, which also includes video-generating apps, erotica updates, and e-commerce features, appears driven by the immense, currently unprofitable, costs of developing advanced AI models. OpenAI is seeking new revenue streams to fund its ambitious goals, including curing cancer.</p>

          <p>Four men arrested in September for projecting images of Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle during the US president's state visit will not face charges. Thames Valley Police concluded their investigation, taking no further action against the individuals, who were initially held on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance. The nine-minute video, projected by the UK campaign group Led By Donkeys, focused on Trump's links to Epstein, including a recently released alleged letter. The campaign group had previously criticized the arrests as "ridiculous" and "heavy-handed," suggesting they were made for embarrassing the president.</p>

          <p>Traditional savings accounts currently offer an average interest rate of just 0.40%, failing to keep pace with inflation and effectively causing savers to lose money. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts typically provide rates between 4.20% and 4.30%, with potential for even higher returns when shopping online. This article demonstrates how different deposit amounts can accrue hundreds of dollars in interest over a year, highlighting the significant earning potential. While these rates are variable, Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts are also suggested as a fixed-rate alternative for those concerned about future rate cuts, offering stability for long-term savings.
