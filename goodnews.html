        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system resistant to hacking, even by quantum computers. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution, which uses quantum mechanics for secure key transmission, and Post-Quantum Cryptography, which employs complex mathematical problems to protect data. This combination creates an end-to-end quantum-secure architecture for real-time communication, data protection, and identity authentication. According to Peng Chengzhi, a chief quantum scientist at China Telecom, public key-based encryption systems face increasing threats from advancements in quantum computing.</p>
