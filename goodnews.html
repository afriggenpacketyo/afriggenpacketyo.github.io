          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a 22% increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, primarily supported by the French state. The company plans to use the funds, along with debt refinancing, to invest in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the capital increase, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted the move as ensuring France's strategic independence and paving the way for Europe's technological advancement. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of the Los Angeles Lakers for a record $10 billion signifies that sports teams have become too valuable for individual billionaires to control. The shift in majority ownership from the Buss family to an investment group led by Mark Walter highlights the trend of teams being owned by consortiums of deep-pocketed investors and institutions. While the decline of cable poses a threat, the Lakers' strong connection to Los Angeles ensures continued growth. The new ownership is expected to benefit the team by attracting more stars, though the shift raises questions about accountability for teams without the Lakers' advantages.</p>

          <h2>Study Challenges Hypothesis on Why Birds Sing at Dawn</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that early morning vocal activity is more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about food sources. While the study doesn't definitively identify one reason for the dawn chorus, it provides valuable insights into the complex factors influencing bird behavior.</p>
