          <p>Cameron McGerr, 16, is passionately campaigning for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after tragically losing both his parents to heart conditions. He firmly believes that having been taught life-saving CPR skills at a younger age could have enabled him to intervene and potentially save his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest. Having successfully introduced the training at his own school, Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign aims to equip more young people across Scotland with these vital emergency skills. Health organizations and medical charities support this initiative, emphasizing that greater public confidence in performing CPR could significantly improve the low survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines across the UK celebrated the Gaza ceasefire and the release of hostages after two years of captivity, with phrases like "Freed from hell" and "Two years of torment over." Photos depicted emotional reunions, including Avinatan Or making a heart gesture and the reunion of twins Gali and Ziv Berman. The Guardian noted joy among both Israelis and Palestinians. Donald Trump, while enjoying the "historic dawn," is also reportedly looking to end the Ukraine war, with former Foreign Secretary William Hague suggesting a Nobel Peace Prize could be within reach if diplomacy is backed by hard power.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 01:16:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England faces a significant selection headache regarding its striker options beyond star player Harry Kane, who has been in superb scoring form with 18 goals in his last 10 matches. With Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins injured, the lack of other out-and-out strikers in the squad has become increasingly apparent. Remarkably, only seven English players classified as pure strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, with Chelsea's Liam Delap being the sole player under 26. Under-21s manager Lee Carsley has also highlighted the pressing need for more orthodox number nines. As England nears World Cup qualification, the race to be Kane's reliable backup is intensifying amidst a perceived scarcity of specialist goalscorers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is advocating for an urgent, targeted prostate cancer screening program in the UK, asserting it would be affordable, deliverable, and save countless lives. His push coincides with the UK National Screening Committee's re-evaluation of its prior stance against routine screening. The Prostate Cancer Research charity, supported by Sunak, proposes a program focusing on men aged 45-69 with a family history or black men, who face double the risk, estimating an annual cost of £25 million. While some medical experts caution against potential overtreatment and side effects, Sunak highlights the enhanced reliability of current testing methods, particularly with the integration of MRI scans, making the moment opportune for implementation.</p>

          <h2>UK Driving Licence Applicants to be Encouraged to Register as Blood Donors</h2>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) have launched a new campaign to encourage driving licence applicants to register as blood donors. This initiative aims to reach millions of people annually, particularly younger individuals aged 16 and 17, as over half of current regular donors are over 45. By including a registration link in post-application emails, the scheme hopes to replicate the success of the organ donor register prompt, which has significantly boosted sign-ups since 1994. Hospitals across England require 5,000 daily donations, and with critical shortages, especially for O negative blood, this partnership represents a crucial step to maintain safe and reliable supplies for patients.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded faster than expected in the third quarter, with GDP rising 2.9% year-on-year, surpassing economists' forecasts despite a slowdown from the previous quarter. However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned of slower growth in 2026 as trade-related sectors normalize. While manufacturing was a drag, global AI investment is expected to support the sector, and construction and financial services may benefit from infrastructure spending. The MAS maintained its policy settings, anticipating core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising, signaling a "comfortable hold" rather than a dovish pause despite recent declines in inflation.
