          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, President Trump congratulated the cadets and took credit for rebuilding the U.S. military, highlighting his administration's shift away from foreign interventions and nation-building. He emphasized the focus on crushing America's adversaries and defending the flag, also noting the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies. While touting a new peacetime recruiting record, CBS News found that enlistments began rebounding during the previous administration due to recruitment reforms. The Vice President also spoke at the U.S. Naval Academy, reinforcing the administration's foreign policy goals. </p>
