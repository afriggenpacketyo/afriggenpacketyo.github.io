          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney is working to stabilize the Scottish National Party (SNP) and focus its agenda on public services ahead of the upcoming Holyrood election. After a period of internal turmoil, Swinney has steadied the party, which now holds a double-digit lead over a slumping Labour party in recent polls. At the SNP's annual conference, he will navigate debates on independence strategy, advocating for winning a majority of seats as the primary path to a new referendum. Swinney's leadership aims to balance the party's core independence goal with practical governance to regain public trust.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. This development followed a personal letter she sent to Putin in August, urging him to protect children affected by the war. According to Mrs. Trump, the children had been displaced to Russia due to the conflict, and their return was facilitated by both Ukrainian and Russian authorities. This initiative is part of her broader "BE BEST" campaign, which focuses on the well-being of children globally.</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has issued new guidelines cautioning local authorities against giving artificial intelligence systems access to sensitive information or state secrets. The directive outlines approved uses for AI in governance, such as answering public inquiries, monitoring infrastructure, and drafting documents, while emphasizing the need for robust safety evaluations before deployment. This move is part of a broader effort by Beijing to enhance government efficiency and reduce bureaucratic burdens on officials. The guidelines also mandate that government workers receive training on AI technology, safety, and ethics.</p>

          <p>With an impressive start to the season, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is the clear frontrunner for the Premier League's Golden Boot award. Having scored nine goals in his first seven games, none of which were penalties, he is already three goals ahead of his nearest competitors. Statistical analysis shows that Haaland is not only scoring frequently but is also receiving a significantly higher number and quality of scoring chances compared to other players in the league. His strong performance, combined with slower starts from his typical rivals, positions him as the dominant force in the race for top scorer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) are pushing to criminalize verbal sexual harassment in public spaces, a behavior often referred to as "catcalling." Citing a legal loophole, the party argues that such acts are a form of violence that intimidates victims and should be punishable by law, similar to measures in other European countries like Belgium and France. Critics, including some coalition partners, have questioned the practicality of such legislation, suggesting it is a populist move. Legal experts note that existing insult laws are rarely applied to sexist remarks, creating a need for clearer legal definitions and protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom, in coordination with France and Germany, has stated its readiness to use the full value of frozen Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's war effort. Prime Minister Keir Starmer communicated this unified stance to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, aiming to increase pressure on Russia to negotiate an end to the conflict. This marks a significant policy shift, as previously only the profits and interest from the over £25 billion in frozen assets were utilized for aid. The move aligns with calls from the United States to take more decisive action to fund Ukraine's defense.</p>
