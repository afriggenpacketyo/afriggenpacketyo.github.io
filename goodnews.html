        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a specific blend of cannabis oil was more effective than a placebo and offered better relief than opioids for chronic low back pain. The studies, described as groundbreaking, showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to those on opioids. While the findings support anecdotal evidence, researchers caution that the pain reduction was modest and the treatment is not a panacea. The German company behind the product, Vertanical, plans to seek market approval in Europe, but FDA approval in the U.S. could take years.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged by approximately 17% after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of mining for rare earths. The CEO revealed that geological surveys have indicated potential deposits at two of the company's sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China for these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, weapons systems, and semiconductors. The company aims to contribute to American mineral independence, positioning itself as a key domestic supplier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While automakers like GM and Ford are expected to report lower earnings, overall sales and production have held up better than anticipated, leading some financial firms to upgrade their sector outlook from negative to neutral. However, persistent headwinds remain, including slowing consumer demand, stress in the subprime auto lending market, and the economic uncertainty of a government shutdown. The industry continues to navigate a complex balancing act of costs and opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

For Starbucks, Cramer anticipates a strong 2026, citing a turnaround strategy under its CEO and a higher-than-expected valuation of its China business. He recommended buying Starbucks stock, reflecting a confident outlook on its future performance despite Morgan Stanley analysts predicting a challenging upcoming quarter for the coffee giant.

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are urged to carefully evaluate their coverage options for the upcoming year, especially as a government shutdown could affect access to information. Experts advise waiting to finalize decisions until the government reopens to ensure all information is available, though critical enrollment functions are expected to continue. Beneficiaries should compare traditional Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, weighing tradeoffs like provider networks, out-of-pocket costs, and supplemental benefits. It is particularly important to review Part D prescription drug plans, as coverage and costs can change significantly from year to year.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated on Monday that he believes the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. He suggested that moderate Democrats may soon agree to a short-term funding resolution, allowing for further negotiations on policy disputes like healthcare subsidies to proceed afterward. However, Hassett also warned that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration might consider imposing "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown continues amid a partisan stalemate, with Republicans seeking a clean funding bill and Democrats demanding the inclusion of extended Affordable Care Act tax credits.</p>

The advice includes presenting work as rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preemptively seeking their opinion to get ahead of criticism and directly asking for positive feedback to balance the focus on adjustments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include historically heavy government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline value for the used market. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, can make older EV models seem obsolete more quickly. As more affordable, mainstream EVs enter the market and the technology stabilizes, experts anticipate that this depreciation gap could begin to narrow, making used EVs a more attractive option for value-oriented buyers.

The report noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents driven by an influx of middle-class workers.
