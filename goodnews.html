          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Suggests Potential Changes to TSA Liquid Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the TSA's rules regarding liquids in carry-on bags may be changing. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. Noem stated she is questioning all TSA procedures and that an announcement on liquid container sizes could be next, though no specific details or timeline were provided. The current 3.4-ounce liquid limit was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot, and any change would likely be supported by new CT scanning technology being deployed at airports.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists, setting aside political divisions for a charitable cause. The event, co-founded by Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, an organization supporting young adults with breast cancer. Unlike the men's partisan game, the women play on a single unified team. Over its 17-year history, the game has raised nearly $5 million, providing a rare moment of bipartisan unity on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>A review column in the Los Angeles Times' Spanish-language section covers several new film releases, including a sequel and a neo-western. The article provides critiques for "I Know What You Did Last Summer," noting it is an improvement on the original but ultimately not memorable. It also reviews Ari Aster's new film "Eddington," a pandemic-era neo-western starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which is described as a realistic and ambitious work. The column further discusses the bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," offering a broad overview of current cinema.</p>

          <p>A 1.5-million-year-old ice core, the oldest ever retrieved from Antarctica, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will melt the ice to release trapped materials like ancient dust and volcanic ash, which hold vital information about Earth's climate history from an unknown period. The research could revolutionize the understanding of climate change by revealing details about past temperatures, wind patterns, and sea levels. This multinational effort aims to shed light on a mysterious period when the planet's glacial cycles suddenly changed, offering potential insights into our climate future.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June as Rice Prices Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The cooling was partly attributed to an easing in rice price inflation, though overall inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data comes amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs. While persistent inflation supports the case for a rate hike, some analysts believe the Bank of Japan will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom, set to take effect next July, will require Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees from these currently unregulated services. The move will bring BNPL lending in line with other forms of credit, ensuring clearer information and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. As a result, some consumers may be denied this type of credit for potentially unaffordable purchases.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition. The diagnosis came after medical tests were conducted in response to mild swelling observed in his lower legs. A physician's note confirmed the condition is not serious and is common in his age group, stating Trump remains in "excellent health." The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing the president with swollen legs and bruised hands, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking while taking aspirin.</p>

Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but the agreement brings an end to a trial where Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg had been expected to testify.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver and former USC star Jordan Addison has avoided jail time in his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of reckless driving. Addison was arrested after a highway patrol officer found him asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic. As part of the plea deal, he was sentenced to 12 months of probation and must pay a fine and complete online courses. While he has resolved the legal matter, Addison could still face a three-game suspension from the NFL under its substance abuse policy.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the package, which requires unanimous approval from all 27 member states, due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including its Nord Stream pipelines and access to the SWIFT payment system.</p>
