          <h2>Survey: Master's Degree Doesn't Guarantee Better Job Performance, But Still Commands Higher Pay.</h2>

        </div>

          <p>A survey by Resume Genius reveals that 62% of hiring managers believe employees with master's degrees perform the same or worse than those with a bachelor's degree and two years of experience. Despite this perception, 72% of hiring managers would still offer a higher salary to candidates with a master's degree, with increases ranging from 10% to 20% or more. The perceived value of a master's degree lies in its symbolic representation of drive, discipline, and commitment, although employers are increasingly recognizing the value of practical experience. The trend toward skills-based hiring, as seen in companies like JP Morgan Chase and Walmart, suggests a shift in priorities from credentials to demonstrated abilities. The study highlights the evolving landscape of hiring practices and the enduring, albeit potentially diminishing, value of advanced degrees in the workplace.</p>

          <p>The CDC has revised its COVID-19 vaccine guidance, stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine, moving away from a broad recommendation for all children. This update follows an announcement that the agency would stop recommending the vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The new guidance emphasizes shared clinical decision-making, where parents' desires for their children to be vaccinated are considered alongside healthcare provider judgment and personal circumstances. The CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and all adults, though the agency has not updated its immunization schedule to reflect the exclusion of pregnant women, causing confusion. The situation reflects a shift in the approach to COVID-19 vaccination, balancing public health recommendations with individual preferences. </p>

          <p>The 2025 cicada invasion has commenced, with Brood XIV emerging from underground and swarming parts of the U.S., particularly Kentucky and Tennessee. This 17-year event involves billions of cicadas surfacing, though this year's emergence is less widespread than previous simultaneous brood emergences. Experts state that cicadas are harmless to pets and humans, serving as a beneficial food source for birds and aerating the soil. Photos document the beginning of this natural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Costco reported strong earnings and revenue, with sales jumping 8%, but shares dipped slightly, while it also exceeded estimates for earnings and revenue. The company's leaders discussed the challenges and higher costs associated with tariffs, which are raising economic worries and potentially consumer prices. Despite tariff-related cost differences, Costco has absorbed some costs and lowered prices on certain items, while increasing prices on others. The company's competitive prices and bulk discounts could attract more customers, making it a resilient retailer in an uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>
