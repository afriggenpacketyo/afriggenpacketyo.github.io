          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 13:38:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This investment article from CNBC's Investing Club encourages regular investors to embrace high-priced stocks by focusing on underlying valuation metrics rather than the per-share cost. It explains that technological advancements like fractional share trading allow investors to allocate specific dollar amounts, making even expensive stocks accessible to a wider audience. The article emphasizes that dividend yields and overall investment value are determined by the dollar amount invested, not the number of shares owned. Ultimately, investment selection based on company fundamentals, management quality, and growth opportunities should take precedence over share price, broadening the scope of potential investments and debunking the misconception that more shares equate to better value (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and "annihilate" democracy. The sprawling plot involved an online disinformation campaign, plans for assassinations, and culminated in the January 2023 riots in Brasília, though it failed when military chiefs refused to participate. Seven close allies from the military and security establishment were also convicted, marking a hugely important moment for Brazil in challenging historical norms of impunity. This conviction sends a powerful signal globally that leaders must be held accountable for undermining democratic norms, reinforcing the triumph of the people's will.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale" delivers a satisfying conclusion to the cherished British costume drama, set in the pivotal year of 1930. Creator Julian Fellowes expertly grounds the narrative in the familiar social and familial dramas of the aristocratic Crawley family and their staff, rather than venturing into new settings. The article highlights Fellowes' skill in using the period setting to comment on contemporary issues, such as tabloid scandals surrounding divorce and generational struggles over leadership, which creates an appealing tension between archaic cultural norms and enduring human experiences. With a mix of returning and new characters, the film continues its social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven't.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant debate is emerging among financial experts regarding the fate of a record $7.6 trillion parked in money market funds as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates. While some on Wall Street speculate this "wall of cash" could fuel a stock market rally, others, like Peter Crane of Crane Data, argue that money fund assets historically only decline during severe economic crises. Crane suggests that most of this institutional and corporate cash is unlikely to move into riskier assets, even with modest rate cuts. Investors are advised to consider various portfolio options based on their risk tolerance, as the impact of rate changes on these funds may be less dramatic than commonly believed (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows LAPD Shootings Decline Despite Recent Spikes</h2>

          <p>An analysis of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer-involved shootings (OIS) reveals a significant long-term decline, with annual incidents down 72% from 1990 levels, despite recent three-day clusters. The article argues that OIS numbers correlate primarily with violent crime rates, not a "trigger-happy" culture, and that post-2018 reforms emphasizing restraint and "command and control" have consistently reduced shootings below crime-predicted levels. While acknowledging the need for continued scrutiny of individual cases, the overall trend demonstrates professionalism and effective reforms within the department. This suggests that system-level judgments should be grounded in data and context, rather than isolated incidents or headlines, to accurately assess the LAPD's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the 1985 congressional hearing where Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) championed the implementation of warning labels on albums with explicit lyrics. Musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Frank Zappa, and John Denver vehemently opposed the initiative, arguing for parental responsibility and against what they perceived as censorship. Gore, however, framed labeling as essential "truth in packaging" to enable parental guidance. The PMRC ultimately succeeded, leading to the now-iconic "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers, which ironically sometimes boosted sales for artists. This historical account highlights the enduring debate over artistic freedom, moral oversight, and the influence of media on youth, a discussion that continues to resonate today.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are actively working to revitalize their inexplicably struggling offense, which ranked 30th in baseball during a recent five-week stretch, a surprising downturn for their high-priced roster. Despite boasting the best offense in the majors in the first half, the team has since struggled significantly with scoring, batting average, and hitting with runners in scoring position. Manager Dave Roberts and players attribute the slump not just to personnel issues and nagging injuries, but also to a loss of focus on "team at-bats" and fundamental execution at the plate. Through renewed emphasis on competitiveness, daily film sessions, and internal accountability, the Dodgers hope to transform their summer frustrations into valuable lessons, aiming to rectify their ailing offense before the crucial playoffs.</p>

          <p>Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki, 73, as its first female interim Prime Minister, following deadly anti-corruption protests that ousted the previous government. Karki, widely regarded for her integrity and supported by "Gen Z" student activists, was sworn in after a deal was reached with protest leaders. The unrest, initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into a mass movement fueled by broader discontent over corruption and a "nepo kid" campaign, resulting in over 50 deaths and the burning of government buildings. The new interim government is now tasked with dissolving parliament and conducting general elections within six months, aiming to restore stability to the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has successfully sidestepped a potentially hefty EU antitrust fine by committing to unbundle its Teams workplace communication platform from its popular Office productivity apps. The European Commission accepted Microsoft's pledges, which include offering Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, allowing customers to switch licenses, and ensuring interoperability with rival tools. This decision, binding for at least seven years, resolves an antitrust investigation initiated in July 2023 following a complaint from Salesforce-owned Slack. The agreement aims to foster fair competition in the market for communication and collaboration software, ensuring that customers have greater choice and that Microsoft's tying practices do not hinder rivals.</p>

His son, Nkosinathi Biko, expressed confidence that the democratic court will now find his father's murder was orchestrated and executed by the implicated policemen. This landmark decision by the National Prosecuting Authority aims to finally bring accountability for apartheid-era crimes, addressing a historical lack of prosecutions that has frustrated many families seeking justice and a crucial correction of the nation's historical record.</p>

          <p>With rising inflation straining fixed incomes, many seniors are seeking ways to access their substantial home equity without incurring new monthly payments. This article outlines several options specifically designed for older adults, including reverse mortgages, which provide funds as a lump sum, installments, or a line of credit, with repayment deferred until the home is sold or vacated. Home equity sharing agreements offer upfront cash in exchange for a share of future home appreciation, with no monthly interest charges. Additionally, sale-leaseback arrangements allow seniors to sell their home to an investor and then rent it back, unlocking full equity value. These solutions provide crucial financial flexibility for "house rich, cash poor" retirees, but each requires careful consideration of associated costs, terms, and long-term implications (not investment advice).</p>
