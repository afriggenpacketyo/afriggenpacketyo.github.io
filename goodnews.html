          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The settlement will provide approximately $3,000 for each covered book, addressing claims of wrongful acquisition of materials from pirate websites. While the court previously ruled that AI training itself constitutes transformative fair use, this agreement resolves specific claims regarding how the materials were obtained. The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers lauded the settlement as a landmark step in holding AI developers accountable for infringement and encouraging legal licensing.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Seeks to Regulate Loud Streaming Commercials Nationwide</h2>

          <p>A California Senate bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the main programming. This legislative effort, directly sparked by parents whose 8-month-old baby was repeatedly woken by blaring ads, seeks to extend federal CALM Act protections, which currently apply only to traditional broadcasters, to streaming platforms. Given California's substantial market influence, the passage of this bill could effectively set a national standard if signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing complexities in managing ad volumes from various sources, but advocates argue streamers possess the technical capability.</p>

          <p>The UK's first stem cell collection center solely dedicated to transplants has opened at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, aiming to significantly increase life-saving donations for patients with blood cancers and disorders. Run by the Anthony Nolan charity in partnership with the National Institute for Health and Care Research, the new center will create 1,300 new donation slots annually, directly addressing a critical and longstanding global shortage of cell collection facilities. This expansion is crucial, as previous capacity issues meant only a fifth of donors on the UK registry were able to donate on the date requested by medical teams. The initiative offers renewed hope for many patients, with early donors expressing profound satisfaction in helping others.</p>

          <p>US country music star Luke Combs highlights the genre's surging popularity in the UK, noting it's the fastest-growing genre with three billion streams last year. Combs, who is performing at the historic Grand Ole Opry's first-ever international show in London, credits streaming for introducing country music to a wider British audience. He observes a significant difference in UK fans compared to their American counterparts, describing them as a "listening crowd" who consume entire albums and focus intently on lyrics, contrasting with the louder, more "melee" atmosphere often found at US shows. This unique and appreciative engagement motivates artists like Combs to invest more time and energy in touring the UK.</p>

          <p>CBS News California interviewed 11 candidates running for California governor in 2026, asking them to evaluate Governor Gavin Newsom's and the Legislature's performance and outline their own policy differences. Democratic candidates, such as Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra, generally praised Newsom's efforts in areas like strengthening the economy and confronting the Trump administration, while also suggesting improvements in addressing the housing crisis or high-speed rail.

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia, were seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at John F. Kennedy Airport and subsequently found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade for Endangered Species, was in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without intervention. Aquarium staff, describing their facility as a "coral hospital," successfully nursed many pieces back to health, and some are now on public display. This successful rescue effort highlights the ongoing fight against illegal wildlife trade and the aquarium's crucial role in conservation, rehabilitation, and public education regarding endangered species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation weight-loss drugs, for up to $7.3 billion, is expected to encourage increased research spending on innovative products in China, according to analysts. This significant deal signals that major pharmaceutical players are still willing to make large investments in differentiated innovation within the rapidly evolving obesity drug market. The transaction, which includes substantial future payments based on drug-development results, aims to strengthen Pfizer's pipeline with "next-generation" candidates designed to achieve better efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections than current market offerings. The article suggests this trend will motivate companies already developing obesity drugs, including those in China, to continue their substantial investments in this therapeutic area.

          <h2>Aggressive Squirrel Terrorizes California Neighborhood, Sending Residents to ER</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of a California neighborhood in San Rafael are on edge due to an unusually aggressive squirrel that has attacked several people, sending at least two to the emergency room for bites and scratches. One 80-year-old victim recounted being ambushed by the squirrel, which prompted a neighborhood warning flyer about the "attack squirrel." While it is rare for squirrels to attack humans, experts from Marin Humane suggest this aggressive behavior likely stems from people hand-feeding or hand-raising the animal. This interaction causes the squirrel to lose its natural instinct to avoid humans and become aggressive when it expects food and doesn't receive it. This incident serves as a stark reminder against the dangers of feeding wildlife.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese official, Yang Weimin, has urged greater efforts to boost household income over the next five years, emphasizing consumption as the key driver for China's future economic growth. His comments come ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee's fourth plenum, where the country's next five-year plan will be discussed. Yang, who helped draft multiple previous plans, specifically advocated for increasing the share of household disposable income in national income and boosting consumer spending's share of total demand. This strategic shift highlights China's focus on internal consumption to power the world's second-largest economy, aiming to address weak consumer demand and ensure sustainable growth.

          <p>Costco surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in both membership income and its robust e-commerce business. CFO Gary Millerchip noted the retailer's proactive efforts to offset higher tariff costs by introducing Kirkland Signature private-label alternatives and strategically sourcing more U.S.-made items. The company also reported an increase in traffic to stores and its website, alongside a growing and increasingly younger member base, with nearly half of new signups from individuals under 40. Costco plans to open 35 new warehouses in the coming fiscal year, demonstrating continued expansion and successful adaptation to consumer value-seeking trends in a challenging economic environment.

          <p>Oil major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, outperforming rivals and significantly reducing earlier speculation about a potential takeover by companies like Shell or Exxon Mobil. This improved sentiment is attributed to a comprehensive strategic reset, a recent leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program, and a string of recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on organic growth to drive shareholder value, while Shell had explicitly denied any takeover talks in June. Analysts note the selection of a new chair with a track record of successful turnarounds as a recent catalyst, further bolstered by BP's strong second-quarter results that comfortably beat analyst expectations.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 238 into law, providing up to one year of mortgage relief for victims of the January 7th firestorms. This urgency measure allows borrowers to pause mortgage payments for up to 12 months without incurring late fees or penalties, simply by attesting to financial hardship caused by the fires. The law also prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating foreclosures and offers more generous relief than previous voluntary programs, including protections for credit scores and banning lump sum repayments after the forbearance period. This legislation aims to ease the significant financial burden on thousands of homeowners struggling to rebuild or repair their homes amidst ongoing insurance claim issues, providing crucial stability during a challenging recovery period.</p>
