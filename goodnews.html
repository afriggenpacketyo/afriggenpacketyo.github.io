          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first hurricane of the season in that region. The storm rapidly intensified from a tropical depression and is currently a Category 1 hurricane, expected to strengthen to Category 2 before gradually weakening. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center express high confidence that Iona will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands as it moves westward. This development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several major storms.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator, the CAAC, is surveying national airlines about their future fleet needs, specifically inquiring about overdue orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests a potential thaw in trade relations, where increased aircraft purchases could be part of a broader deal with the United States. A recent high-level meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president also signaled a desire for expanded cooperation. Boeing has often been affected by bilateral tensions, but it stands to benefit significantly if diplomatic and trade ties improve.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by Azoria Capital, an investment fund led by a Donald Trump ally, which sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned whether the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, a claim the plaintiff's lawyer denied. The suit alleged the Fed was keeping rates high to undermine Trump's economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders announced he is "cured from the cancer" after undergoing surgery to remove his bladder in May. The operation was performed after a high-grade tumor was discovered during a routine health checkup. The two-time Super Bowl champion confirmed he will continue coaching and used the announcement to urge others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health screenings. Sanders has faced previous health issues, including the amputation of two toes in 2021.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase alleges that fintech data aggregators, such as Plaid, are "massively taxing" its computer systems with an excessive number of data requests. According to an internal memo, only a small fraction of the billions of monthly data pulls are initiated by customers for active transactions, with the rest used for other purposes like data harvesting. The bank, which is preparing to charge fees for this data access, also claims that these transactions are linked to higher rates of fraud.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "4% rule," a well-known guideline for retirement income that suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in the first year of retirement and adjusting for inflation annually. It then explores how this rule can be used as a benchmark to evaluate annuities. If an annuity offers a guaranteed income stream higher than what the 4% rule would provide, it may be a valuable tool for longevity protection, though it may lack inflation adjustments and liquidity. The piece suggests a hybrid strategy, using an annuity for essential expenses and a traditional portfolio for discretionary spending, can balance security with flexibility.

          <p>The price of gold is holding firm ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting, as markets widely expect the central bank to maintain current interest rates. While lower rates historically boost gold prices, the metal has recently surged due to inflation and geopolitical concerns, overriding the typical interest rate relationship. Analysts suggest that while a rate cut is not anticipated, comments from the Fed after the meeting or future inflation data could still influence the price. With gold currently priced below recent highs, some see a potential buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>
