          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 11:34:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle and Silver Lake are reportedly part of a consortium involved in a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., pending finalization of an agreement between the U.S. and China. The structure of the deal is still unclear, including the level of involvement of Chinese firms like ByteDance and control over TikTok's recommendation algorithm. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that commercial terms have been agreed upon, while China has stated it will defend its companies' rights. The agreement follows legislation requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. due to national security concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to potentially ban TikTok in the U.S. was a key factor in reaching a deal framework with China. The deal, which includes new investors, aims to address national security concerns while allowing TikTok to continue operating in the U.S.. Bessent noted that commercial terms were agreed upon earlier, but the Chinese government put the deal on hold after Trump's tariff announcement. Despite Trump's openness to a ban, the White House has also launched its own TikTok account, indicating the app's continued relevance.</p>

Standing out and being impressive involves taking on more responsibility and signaling a willingness to embrace new challenges. Building relationships and expanding social capital are also crucial during tough job markets to prepare for future opportunities.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage rates as of September 15, 2025, show averages of 5.71% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.53% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.00% and 6.72%, respectively. Experts suggest that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and that strengthening credit profiles and shopping around can help secure better rates. When choosing a mortgage or refinance loan, consider loan terms, fees, and overall costs to ensure affordability, and lock in the rate after making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The sentence aims to recognize the suffering of victims and ensure reparations, though some criticize the lack of harsher punishments.

          <p>India and the European Union are on track to finalize free trade agreement negotiations by the end of the year, driven by the pressure of U.S. tariffs and a desire for stable partnerships. For India, this means tariff-free entry for key exports and reduced reliance on volatile U.S. markets, while for the EU, it diversifies supply chains and secures trade in agriculture and technology. Sticking points include the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and market access for specific products, but a breakthrough is expected in the auto sector.</p>
