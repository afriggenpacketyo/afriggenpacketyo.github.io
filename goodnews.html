          <p>UFC fighter Paddy Pimblett is aiming for a bout in Abu Dhabi this October, ideally against Ilia Topuria, though a fight with Justin Gaethje is more probable. Pimblett, fresh off a victory over Michael Chandler, is seeking an opponent ranked in the top five, and while he'd prefer to face Topuria, who is scheduled to fight Charles Oliveira, Gaethje is a likely alternative. Pimblett and Topuria have a history of conflict, and Pimblett believes a fight with Gaethje would be exciting and draw significant viewership, bringing him closer to a title shot. Gaethje, known for his knockout power, last fought in March, securing a win over Rafael Fiziev.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stellantis, the multinational auto conglomerate, has named Antonio Filosa as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa, previously the North American chief operating officer and Jeep CEO, will assume his new role effective June 23, navigating the company through a "pivotal time" in the industry. The appointment follows a period of uncertainty for Stellantis, marked by a decline in first-quarter net revenues and the withdrawal of its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. John Elkann will continue as executive chairman, supporting Filosa in this next phase of Stellantis' development.</p>

          <p>Antony's impressive performance on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United has led to humorous appeals from the Spanish club's players to retain the Brazilian winger. Betis captain Isco jokingly posted a sinister message on Instagram about kidnapping Antony, and former Betis winger Joaquin joined in, offering to provide a car for the abduction. Since joining in January, Antony has been instrumental in the club's transformation, helping them move from ninth to sixth in La Liga and securing a spot in the Europa League. He also played a key role in leading the team to their first European final, where they will face Chelsea in the Conference League.</p>

Having also worked under Pep Guardiola, Maresca is known for his tactical innovations, including the use of inverted full-backs, and Pellegrini acknowledges Maresca's ability and dedication to learning.

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to distribute lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas amid soaring rice prices. This decision follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi indicated the government would impose purchase limits on large retailers to ensure wider distribution. Retail rice prices have doubled from a year earlier, prompting the government to switch to direct sales to retailers after previous auctions failed to curb the price surge.</p>

The move could benefit all parties, with Cunha seeking a bigger club and Wolves potentially receiving over ¬£60 million for reinvestment. United, who may allow Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to leave, needs to bolster their attacking options after a poor goal-scoring season.</p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) counted 43,626 puffins on the island this year, a new high. Skomer's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, contributing to the thriving puffin population. However, the WTSWW warns that puffins remain a species under threat and require continued protection, as they face pollution, food shortages, and climate change elsewhere.</p>
