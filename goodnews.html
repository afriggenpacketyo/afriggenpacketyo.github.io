          <p>Vogue has appointed Chloe Malle as the new Head of Editorial Content for its U.S. edition, succeeding the iconic Anna Wintour. Malle, a 14-year veteran of the magazine and current editor of Vogue.com, will take over daily operations while Wintour remains as global editorial director and chief content officer for Condé Nast. Wintour, who led the magazine for over three decades, praised Malle's ability to balance Vogue's history with its future and will continue to serve as her mentor. The appointment concludes widespread speculation about who would fill one of the most powerful roles in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing the need for "generational change," the 78-year-old congressman stated his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older party leaders. First elected in 1992, Nadler chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as an impeachment manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up his seat, for which he was already facing a primary challenge from a younger candidate.</p>

Following the news, PepsiCo's shares jumped by 5% as investors anticipated changes driven by the influential activist firm.

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), positioning them as a tool to combat inflation. While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs yielding over 4%. The report notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, the article suggests looking at online banks, considering short-term CDs, and laddering investments across different term lengths to balance high rates with long-term savings goals.

          <h2>Experts Highlight Potential for 0% Capital Gains Tax Under New Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 09:00:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate due to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 or married couples up to $96,700 for 2025. With an increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks, more investors may fall into this bracket, allowing them to engage in "tax-gain harvesting" by selling profitable assets without a tax penalty. This strategy can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Blue Owl Capital, a $284 billion alternative asset management firm, is pursuing an unconventional marketing strategy by sponsoring professional tennis players to raise its brand profile. This approach is part of a broader industry shift as private market firms, historically low-profile, seek to attract a wider audience, particularly high-net-worth individuals. By placing its logo on players who compete against top seeds, Blue Owl gains visibility during high-viewership matches at a lower cost than traditional advertising. The strategy reflects the growing need for brand differentiation as alternative investments become more mainstream and accessible to retail investors.</p>

While industry insiders note that additive-free, 100% agave tequila may be better tolerated by some, health experts caution against viewing any alcohol as a health drink. Experts clarify that while clear spirits have fewer congeners, which can worsen hangovers, ethanol itself still negatively impacts sleep, muscle repair, and hydration.

In his victory speech, he positioned the Greens as a political home for those feeling hopeless or disenfranchised by mainstream parties.

          <p>A federal jury in Arkansas found that State Farm systematically underpaid customers for "totaled" vehicles, in a class-action lawsuit representing 37,000 plaintiffs. The case argued that the insurer's software unfairly calculated replacement values by improperly factoring in a "haggling discount" that is inconsistent with modern used-car sales practices. The lead plaintiff was found to have been underpaid by approximately $600 on a car valued at $4,700. State Farm, which no longer uses the same program, is facing similar lawsuits in other states and argues that each claim should be handled individually rather than as a class action.</p>

The report notes that climate change is expected to increase their frequency, especially in mountainous regions. Prevention methods include improving drainage, building retaining walls to reinforce slopes, and avoiding construction in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a resurgence in the luxury vehicle market, driven by strong sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). While the gasoline-powered Escalade remains its top seller, EVs now constitute about a third of the brand's recent sales, far outpacing the industry average. This shift has allowed Cadillac to attract customers from rival luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, with nearly 80% of its new customers trading in cars from these competitors. The brand's success in the EV space presents a significant opportunity for it to recapture the prestige it lost decades ago.</p>

The study found that clopidogrel lowers the risk of future major cardiovascular events by about 14% compared to aspirin, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. While aspirin has been the standard for decades, researchers argue that the evidence supporting it is outdated.

A "flight to quality" is evident, as availability in new, modern buildings has become very tight while older buildings have high vacancy rates. Consequently, Manhattan's overall availability rate has fallen to its lowest point since January 2021, and average asking rents are beginning to rise. (not investment advice)</p>
