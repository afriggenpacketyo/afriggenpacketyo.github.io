          <p>A World Health Organization report indicates a significant drop in tobacco consumption in Southeast Asia over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020. This success is attributed to strong public health initiatives, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and smoke-free public spaces in countries like Singapore and Thailand. However, challenges persist, as Indonesia has not ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework and the region faces a rising trend in e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans for "targeted action" to address cost-of-living challenges in the upcoming November Budget. Speaking in Washington, Reeves indicated that both the government and the Bank of England share the responsibility of reducing inflation, which is forecast to be the highest among G7 nations. Measures being considered could include a cut to the 5% VAT on energy or a reduction in regulatory levies on bills. The government is awaiting a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility to determine the fiscal space for such interventions.</p>

The initiative, in partnership with its AI Solutions Group, will allow gig workers to complete small online tasks, such as uploading photos or recording audio to help train artificial intelligence models. This move, announced at the company's "Only on Uber 2025" conference, aims to provide more earning potential for its workforce, with pay varying based on task complexity.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that the Trump administration has found a way to continue paying FBI agents during the ongoing government shutdown, which has halted pay for most federal workers. While the specific source of the funds was not disclosed, the move ensures that essential law enforcement personnel will receive their paychecks. This follows a similar action to pay members of the military, but raises questions about the administration's legal authority to appropriate funds without congressional approval during a funding lapse.</p>
