Simultaneously, it is purchasing more Costco stock, viewing its 15% decline from its all-time high as a long-term buying opportunity due to the company's consistent market share gains and durable growth story, despite a recent earnings report that was not perfect.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a triennial survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Chinese yuan has expanded its share in global foreign exchange trading to 8.5%, up from 7% in 2022. While the yuan maintains its position as the fifth-most traded currency, this growth reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to promote its international use in trade and finance as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. Despite the gains, analysts note that the yuan's global role still does not fully align with the scale of China's economy, suggesting further efforts are needed to expand its use.

          <p>A recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data highlights major American cities where housing costs consume the smallest portion of residents' income. While housing affordability remains a significant challenge nationwide, with 44% of people struggling with payments, some metropolitan areas stand out for their relative affordability. The study calculated a weighted average of rent and mortgage costs against local median incomes, revealing 16 large cities where the share of income spent on housing is below the national average of 25%, offering a comparative look at financial pressures across the country.

          <p>The city of Berlin plans to honor Helmut Kohl, the chancellor who presided over German reunification, by renaming a central street after him. Kohl, who passed away in 2017, is widely recognized as the key architect of the 1990 reunification, skillfully navigating international diplomacy to bring East and West Germany together. The move to honor him has been delayed for years, partly due to a party financing scandal that tarnished his reputation in the late 1990s, but the city's current governing coalition has now officially announced the location for the tribute.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz won his eighth title of the season by defeating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in the final of the Japan Open. The victory was particularly impressive as Alcaraz had rolled his ankle early in the tournament and played with it heavily bandaged, yet still managed to dominate the final. This win continues a remarkable season for the 22-year-old, who has now reached nine consecutive finals and solidified his position as the world's top player, addressing earlier criticisms about inconsistency with a dominant 66-6 record in individual events this year.</p>
