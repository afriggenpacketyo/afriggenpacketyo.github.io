The proposal aims to extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where concerns about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on marine life have been raised. The proposed extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>

          <p>A new Boeing 737 MAX has landed back in China, signaling a resumption of deliveries as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington ease. Boeing had halted deliveries in April due to escalating tariffs, but announced they would resume in June after a temporary scaling back of tariffs. The plane, painted in Xiamen Airlines livery, arrived at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center near Shanghai. The move indicates a potential thaw in trade relations and positive prospects for Boeing's business in China. (not investment advice)</p>
