          <p>A trade deal between Britain and the United States is anticipated to provide a boost to the British economy, which has been struggling with slow growth. President Trump's announcement of the agreement is expected to alleviate some of the trade uncertainty. Sectors like the auto industry, particularly luxury car manufacturers, are likely to benefit from reduced tariffs. However, the deal's impact may be limited due to the significant proportion of British trade with the U.S. being in services.
