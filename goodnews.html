          <p>Portugal‚Äôs governing center-right coalition won a snap election but failed to secure a majority amid a surge in votes for the hard-right Chega party.

While the center-right Democratic Alliance won 32 percent of the vote, Chega secured around 22 percent, nearly neck and neck with the center-left Socialist Party. The country is likely headed for another unstable minority government.</p>
