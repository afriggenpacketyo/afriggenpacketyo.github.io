          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have been disrupted due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, causing delays and cancellations. Ticket holders are advised to use alternative services on the east coast rail line or request a refund. Network Rail Scotland is working to repair the damaged lines and aims to reopen the line by mid-morning.</p>

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in east London are being kept indoors after a buzzard nested in the playground and began exhibiting dive-bombing behavior. The school is concerned that the bird, nicknamed "Brenda" by the children, is guarding its nest and may attack. Havering Council has advised the school to use legal deterrents and consider hiring a falconry expert. While intervention options are limited due to the buzzard being a protected species, the school is educating children about the bird and trying to allow outdoor play where possible.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the controversial incident between Max Verstappen and George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, where Verstappen was initially forced off the track. Red Bull's decision to order Verstappen to give the place back was later deemed a mistake by team principal Christian Horner, as stewards found Russell had momentarily lost control. The article also discusses Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires under the safety car, which Verstappen questioned, and Horner admitted was incorrect. These strategic errors ultimately impacted Verstappen's race performance.</p>

An electoral win for Lee would determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea.

          <p>Scientists have detected water ice in the debris disk orbiting HD 181327, a young, Sun-like star 155 light-years from Earth, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This discovery provides evidence supporting the theory that water was prevalent in the outer reaches of the Solar System early in its history. The water ice was found in crystalline form, similar to that found in Saturn's rings and the Kuiper Belt. The presence of water ice helps facilitate planet formation, and these icy materials may ultimately be delivered to terrestrial planets.</p>
