          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, Suffolk, experienced the shock of her life when she unexpectedly gave birth to a baby boy in a football club's toilet, having been unaware she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson had no typical pregnancy symptoms and attributed her hip pain to a pre-existing condition. The surprise arrival, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects about one in 2,500 births. The baby, named Henry James, is healthy and was wrapped in a football shirt by family members before paramedics arrived.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a back injury that sidelined him for much of the preseason, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 victory against the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, also surpassing 60,000 career passing yards during the game. The Rams' defense was crucial, limiting the Texans to three field goals and securing the win with a late-game fumble recovery. The victory marks a positive start for the Rams in coach Sean McVay's ninth season.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of couples "living apart together" (LAT) through the story of Margaret, who has lived in London for 15 years while her husband, Peter, resides in Australia. Despite the distance, they maintain a strong and faithful marriage, communicating regularly and visiting each other annually. This arrangement allowed Margaret to pursue a new career and life in her late 50s after her children left home. Experts note that while not for everyone, such arrangements can provide space and help partners maintain their individual identities within a marriage.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, aiming to restore and reopen the beloved attraction ahead of its centennial in 2026. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been mostly closed since 2022 following the death of its operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few of its kind still in existence and requires significant repairs before it can operate again. The acquisition is part of a broader restoration plan for the park.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Bank of America's head of global research, global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, redirecting capital toward Asia. This shift is driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, expectations of looser Federal Reserve policy, and the burgeoning artificial intelligence boom in the region. Analysts note that Asian markets offer more attractive valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks. The global AI market is projected to grow significantly, with a substantial portion of that investment expected to be deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors are looking beyond US equities for the first time in a decade amid a weakening US dollar and likely easing of US monetary policy, moving capital into Asia as they chase the artificial intelligence boom in the region, according to the head of global research at Bank of America (BofA). Ahead of the three-day BofA Securities Asia Pacific Conference starting on Monday, Candace Browning said that US equities had been exceptional from the first half of 2020 to the end of 2024, attracting US$1.2 trillion from global investors, compared with US$200 billion for the rest of the world during the same period. However, the investments have slowed down this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a 34-32 victory over the New York Jets, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin offered a bizarre but complimentary description of his kicker, Chris Boswell. After Boswell successfully kicked a 60-yard field goal to secure the lead, Tomlin described him as a "serial killer" due to his calm demeanor and "low-pulse rate" in high-pressure situations. Boswell has been a reliable kicker for the Steelers since 2015, earning his first All-Pro selection last season. Tomlin's comments highlighted the kicker's crucial role in the team's opening-week win.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a "Blood Moon," a phenomenon where the moon takes on a deep red color as it passes through Earth's shadow. The event was visible across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa, captivating stargazers. Scientists explain the reddish hue is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere, where shorter blue wavelengths are dispersed more easily, allowing longer red wavelengths to reach the moon. This celestial event has been a source of wonder for humans for millennia.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer posits that while President Donald Trump dominates media headlines, his direct impact on the economy and stock market is minimal, making it an unproductive focus for investors. He analyzes the recent weak jobs report, suggesting that while some job losses can be tied to administration policies like government downsizing, the overall economic picture is more complex. Cramer concludes that factors like Federal Reserve policy and individual company performance are far more important for investors to follow.

To secure its future, the piece suggests Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support Hong Kong as a base for multilateral institutions.
