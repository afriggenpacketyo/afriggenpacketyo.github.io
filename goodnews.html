          <p>Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will initially start with about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the upcoming FSD Unsupervised software. Musk emphasized a cautious approach, stating that Tesla will scale up the service gradually after confirming its safety and effectiveness. He has been promising a fully self-driving car for years, but Tesla has yet to offer a vehicle safe for use without human supervision.</p>

          <p>Lowe's affirmed its full-year forecast, citing growth in sales to home professionals that compensated for decreased demand from do-it-yourself customers. The company's first-quarter sales slightly missed expectations, but earnings exceeded estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service amid challenging housing market conditions. Lowe's expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales remaining flat to up 1% year over year.</p>
