          <p>Moderna has reported positive results from a late-stage trial of its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine, showing it produced a stronger immune response than a currently available flu shot. The successful trial clears a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone vaccine and its combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to resubmit its application for the combination vaccine later this year, which could simplify vaccination and improve uptake. This development positions Moderna as a frontrunner in the race to bring a combination respiratory vaccine to market.</p>

          <p>The fast-food chain Raising Cane's has surpassed KFC to become the third-largest chicken chain in the U.S. by annual sales, trailing only Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its remarkably simple menu, which focuses exclusively on chicken fingers, and a business model that favors company-owned restaurants over franchising, ensuring operational consistency. With rapid expansion and high average unit volumes, the chain has more than doubled its sales since 2021. The article details how this focused strategy and efficient service have allowed it to thrive in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Barry, has dissipated after making landfall on Mexico's eastern coast as a tropical depression. The system, which formed in the western Gulf of Mexico, brought tropical storm-force winds to the coast before weakening as it moved inland. While the storm is no longer a cyclone, forecasters expect its remnants to bring several inches of heavy rain to regions like San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning for the area ahead of the storm's arrival.</p>

          <p>Trade negotiations between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its plan to implement a digital services tax on large technology firms. The proposed 3% tax, which would have affected major U.S. companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon, had been strongly opposed by President Trump, who had suspended talks over the issue. Following a phone call between the leaders, Canada announced it would withdraw the tax in anticipation of a broader trade deal. This move is seen as a concession to restart progress on a new economic relationship.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a link between age-related hearing loss and a specific protein deficiency, according to a new study conducted on primates. The findings, published in the journal Nature Aging, provide a detailed characterization of the molecular aging patterns within the cochlea at a single-cell level. In their research, the scientific team also found that the common diabetes medication metformin was able to slow the progression of hearing loss in the monkeys. This suggests a potential new pathway for developing clinical treatments to address presbycusis, or age-related hearing impairment, in humans.</p>

          <p>The field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is on the verge of commercialization, with several companies preparing to launch surgically implanted devices designed to help people with disabilities. These technologies, pioneered in labs over two decades ago, can decode brain signals to allow individuals with paralysis to control computers, move prosthetic limbs, or generate speech. While Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most high-profile player, competitors like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron are also making significant progress, some with less invasive approaches. The first generation of commercial products will likely focus on restoring communication and digital interaction for people with conditions like ALS or spinal cord injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, providing significant relief to the British automotive industry by establishing preferential tariff rates for car imports. While the deal is a boon for automakers, questions remain over the final levies on the U.K.'s metal exports, particularly steel and aluminum. Negotiations to achieve zero-percent tariffs on steel have been complicated by the U.S. "melt and pour" rule, which creates challenges for major producers like Tata Steel. The deal highlights a split outcome, with the vital auto sector secured while the metals industry continues to face uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The measure is part of a broader government effort to protect minors from secondhand smoke and to advance the goal of creating a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators of the new law, which has significant public support but has drawn criticism from some smokers, can face fines of up to several hundred dollars.
