          <p>Following weekend discussions between American and Chinese officials in Geneva, investors are showing optimism about potential progress in easing trade tensions. The meetings, the first since increased tariffs from both countries, concluded with positive remarks from both sides, raising hopes for lowered tariffs. Analysts anticipate an initial agreement to involve reduced tariffs, although economists warn that trade barriers could increase the possibility of an economic downturn. The World Trade Organization has also warned that the division of the global economy into rival blocs could significantly cut global gross domestic product.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to align Medicare drug prices with the lowest prices paid by other countries. This initiative, an attempt to revive a previously unsuccessful program, aims to lower medication costs for Americans. The proposal would likely impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and administered in offices, potentially saving the government money. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly oppose the order, arguing that it could hurt profits and innovation, however Trump insists that it will reduce healthcare costs for citizens.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, renowned for ensuring affordable medical care, faces strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population, becoming entangled in political maneuvering. Analysts warn that turning the system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust. The government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but proposals to increase costs for high medical cost patients have sparked backlash. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government ultimately froze all envisioned hikes following talks with patient advocates in March.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico, citing concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that the decision is about food and animal safety, not politics. The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds or mucous membranes of animals, feeding on their flesh and blood. The U.S. and Mexico previously eradicated the screwworm in the 1960s and '70s, but recent cases have surged in parts of Central America and Mexico.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower U.S. drug costs by aligning them with prices in other wealthy countries. The proposal, termed a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model, aims to ensure the U.S. pays the lowest price among its peer countries. The pharmaceutical industry opposes the idea, warning it would lead to less investment in research. Experts note that the U.S. pays significantly more for drugs than other wealthy nations, despite much of the research taking place in American laboratories.

The trial, involving obese individuals, showed that those on Mounjaro also had better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.
