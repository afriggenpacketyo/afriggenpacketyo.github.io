          <p>German customs officers in Hamburg arrested two men after discovering over 400 kilograms of cocaine packed into more than 20 sports bags. The seizure occurred at the O'Swaldkai container terminal when dock workers noticed the men, who were not port employees, loading the bags into a car from a ship. Officials have warned of a "cocaine surge" in Germany, as the port of Hamburg has become a major entry point for the drug into Europe. The incident highlights the increasing concentration of the international drug trade on the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long throw-in is re-emerging as a potent tactical tool in the Premier League, with Brentford FC leading its revival. The team has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other team in the league. This strategy, reminiscent of Stoke City's use of Rory Delap's throws in the late 2000s, creates chaos for defending teams due to the unusual angle of attack. Brentford's manager, Keith Andrews, who was previously the set-piece coach, defends the tactic against claims of it being unsophisticated, emphasizing its effectiveness in a results-driven sport.</p>

          <p>Belfast's Lewis Crocker has claimed the vacant IBF welterweight world title after a split decision victory over Paddy Donovan at Windsor Park. The fight was a rematch of a previous encounter which Crocker won by disqualification. This time, Crocker's performance was much improved, securing two crucial knockdowns in the third and fifth rounds that proved decisive on the scorecards. Despite a lower output, his powerful and economical counter-punching strategy paid off, improving his professional record to 22-0 in a closely contested and engrossing 12-round bout.</p>

          <p>A recent memorandum of understanding between Hainan province and Hong Kong signals a new era of economic cooperation, not competition. This article argues that Hainan's development as a free trade port complements Hong Kong's established role as a global financial hub. Hong Kong can provide the world-class financial infrastructure, legal services, and risk management needed to support and legitimize the capital flows Hainan aims to attract. Furthermore, collaboration in sectors like tourism, by linking Hainan's duty-free market with Hong Kong's luxury services, could enhance the overall economic competitiveness of southern China.

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. His 15-year legal battle resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's leadership, described by a colleague as being "armed with history," was instrumental in exposing and challenging systemic funding disparities. During his tenure from 1984 to 2010, he oversaw a period of significant growth at Morgan State, now known as "Richardson's Renaissance."</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that have restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is launching major infrastructure projects to ensure future water availability. The plans include building the Rio Indo dam to supplement the canal's main water source and constructing a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline to transport energy products without relying on the waterway. These investments are critical as the canal, which handles about $270 billion in cargo annually, is vital to U.S. and global trade. The projects aim to mitigate the economic risks posed by climate change and recurring low water levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New signing Nick Woltemade made an immediate impact for Newcastle United, scoring the winning goal in his debut match against Wolves just 29 minutes into the game. The 6ft 6in German striker's powerful header provided a timely boost for the team, especially with fellow new forward Yoane Wissa sidelined by injury. Woltemade's performance, praised for both his classic goal-scoring and creative play, quickly won over the fans at St James' Park. His successful debut helps the club move forward following the recent high-profile departure of star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban and granted working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar living in border camps. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move, welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency, will allow refugees to support themselves and their families while also potentially filling labor shortages in Thailand. Advocacy groups see this as a landmark step toward greater self-sufficiency and economic participation for the refugee population.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed several significant and controversial education bills that now await the governor's signature. One bill mandates a phonics-based "science of reading" approach to address lagging literacy scores, overriding traditional local control over curriculum. Another bill aims to improve student health by phasing out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets and corn dogs from school cafeterias. A third measure, prompted by concerns over antisemitism in ethnic studies classes, would establish a state Office for Civil Rights to combat various forms of discrimination in schools.</p>
