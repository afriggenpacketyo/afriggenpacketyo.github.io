          <p>South Africa's highest court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands are now legally permitted to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The Constitutional Court declared the previous law unconstitutional, stating it discriminated based on gender and was a remnant of colonial influence. The case was brought by two couples challenging the Department of Home Affairs, and the government has been given two years to amend the legislation to reflect this progressive change in marital naming conventions.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in Chinese stocks are presenting a challenge for regulators as Beijing aims to transform its $12 trillion equity market into a stable source of wealth for households, thereby boosting consumer spending. The government hopes to guide a sustainable bull market, avoiding the volatile boom-and-bust cycles of the past and shifting household assets away from the property market. While volatility may increase as the market transitions, analysts believe the upward trend is not over, testing the government's ability to manage market sentiment effectively.

          <p>A Scottish couple has finally identified a mystery man who appeared in their wedding photos from four years ago after an appeal on social media went viral. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, revealed he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after being given the incorrect venue details by his partner.

          <p>A potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount Skydance would create a content behemoth, combining vast libraries of valuable intellectual property. Paramount already owns franchises like Star Trek and Mission Impossible, alongside a new exclusive deal for UFC rights. A merger would add Warner's assets, including the DC superheroes, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, plus its portfolio of sports rights like the NHL and March Madness, creating a powerful competitor to industry giants like Disney.

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship when his ball was apparently stolen by spectators. After hitting an errant tee shot just before a weather delay, his ball vanished, with witnesses reporting two individuals running from the area with it. The situation paradoxically worked in his favor, as he was allowed a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position, likely saving him a shot and helping him finish with a strong six-under-par 66.</p>
