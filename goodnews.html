          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks to Network Rail, potentially securing thousands of jobs at the Scunthorpe steelworks. The deal ensures that British Steel will continue to provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, marking a significant vote of confidence in UK workers and industry. This agreement follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners, Jingye. The contract is expected to boost domestic manufacturing and supply chains, supporting economic growth and the UK's infrastructure strategy. </p>

Closer integration between the two cities would position China more favorably to manage the risk of financial decoupling from the U.S. </p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress to develop a nationwide missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome for America," inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles designed to protect against incoming rockets. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles it would need to defend against. Jeffrey Lewis compares the scale of the project to the difference between building a kayak and a battleship. </p>

The train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations. The incident forced two other trains to halt as well. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move a "very important day" for both countries, with the UK government hoping it will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs. The order also agreed to remove tariffs on certain kinds of aerospace products. </p>
