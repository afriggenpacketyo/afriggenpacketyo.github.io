          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after getting lost in a dense Northern California forest, thanks to a series of handwritten notes they left behind. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS failed, and they spent a night in their car. Search and rescue teams, guided by the notes which provided directions and a plea for help, located them in an isolated area. The boy also used a whistle to signal for help, demonstrating resourcefulness that led to their safe recovery.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced a bill aimed at making corporate price gouging illegal, granting more enforcement power to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The proposed legislation specifically targets large corporations that exploit market shocks, such as inflation or "abrupt trade policies," to excessively raise prices on consumers. The bill would also mandate increased transparency in pricing for companies with over $100 million in revenue and allocate $1 billion in additional funding to the FTC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola, health experts are weighing in on whether cane sugar is healthier than high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians note that while there are minor chemical differences, both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. High-fructose corn syrup contains slightly more fructose, which some experts link to a higher risk of conditions like Type 2 diabetes and liver disease. However, both are considered empty calories, and health organizations recommend limiting the intake of all added sugars for better health.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has lifted the extensive gag order in the case of Bryan Kohberger, who recently pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The decision came after a coalition of news organizations argued for its removal, stating that the need to protect the jury pool was no longer relevant since a trial will not occur. The judge agreed, emphasizing that the public's and the press's First Amendment rights to information about the case are now paramount. The original order was put in place to ensure Kohberger's right to a fair trial.</p>

For optimal viewing in the UK and northern hemisphere, stargazers should look for a dark, clear sky away from city lights, typically between midnight and dawn.

          <p>This article explores the nature of charisma, defining it as a combination of influence and affability that makes individuals seem magnetic and exceptional. While some aspects of charisma may be innate, research suggests it can be cultivated through specific techniques, such as practicing emphatic nonverbal communication and powerful vocal inflections. Studies show that charisma is linked to professional success, but its effectiveness can diminish at very high levels, potentially due to an association with narcissism. The article also notes that while charisma is a powerful tool, there is no clear evidence that it directly leads to greater personal happiness.</p>

The review notes the characters' lack of traditional romantic chemistry, arguing the show intentionally portrays their relationship as a pragmatic arrangement born of mutual need rather than passionate infatuation. This "love for a cold climate" is presented as a reflection of modern anxieties, where stability can be more appealing than romance.</p>
