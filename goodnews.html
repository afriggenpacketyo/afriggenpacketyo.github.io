          <h2>Global Matcha Demand Leads to Supply Shortages and Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:41:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in matcha's popularity, fueled by social media and tourism in Japan, is causing significant supply chain issues. Demand is outpacing supply, leading to shortages for cafes and retailers, with some suppliers seeing a month's worth of stock deplete in days. Factors like heatwaves affecting crops, a shrinking farmer population, and new U.S. tariffs are exacerbating the problem, pushing prices higher for the specialized green tea powder. The situation has prompted calls for more mindful consumption and the use of lower-grade matcha for culinary purposes to preserve high-quality tea.</p>

          <p>Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) is experiencing a historic moment, with multiple artists simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100 for extended periods. This trend, driven by a multi-million dollar industry ecosystem, is seeing faith-flavored music, particularly from male country-influenced artists, break into the mainstream. The article explores how megachurches influence the genre's production and how a vast industry supports the recreation of this worship experience in smaller churches. This boom reflects a broader cultural moment where conservative politics, masculinity, and faith are intersecting in popular music, raising questions about its impact on listening habits and the cultural landscape.</p>

          <h2>Skydance Nears Completion of $8 Billion Paramount Merger, Sparking Questions About Company's Future</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:28:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skydance Media is set to finalize its $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, a move that promises significant changes for iconic brands like CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. The new ownership, led by David Ellison and backed by RedBird Capital, has pledged to find $2 billion in cost savings, signaling impending layoffs and major restructuring. Key questions remain about the future of the Paramount+ streaming service, the viability of traditional broadcast TV, and the creative and journalistic independence of assets like "60 Minutes" and "South Park." The deal will also test relationships with major partners like the NFL, which has the option to reopen its long-term broadcast deal with CBS.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release $5.5 billion in congressionally approved education funds that it had previously frozen. The funds, intended for the 2025-26 school year, support programs such as educator training, arts education, and support for English language learners. The initial decision to withhold the money, justified by claims of misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda," drew widespread criticism from educators and even prominent Republican lawmakers. Following the backlash, the Office of Management and Budget completed its review and directed the Department of Education to release the funds, a move praised by concerned lawmakers and school officials.</p>

          <p>An app named Tea, which allows women to review men they have dated and warn others about negative experiences, has surged to become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The platform functions as a large-scale community forum for vetting potential dates, offering features like background checks and verification to ensure users are women. While proponents see it as a valuable safety tool in a market where dating apps often lack proactive safety measures, it also raises concerns about the potential for false accusations and reputational damage. The app's popularity highlights a strong demand for greater security in online dating, though it recently faced a security breach, exposing some user data.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating U.S.-China tensions, Chinese students are still pursuing higher education in the United States, but they are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now placing a greater emphasis on the reputation of schools, the ranking of specific programs, and the availability of financial aid. While parents express anxiety about instability in the U.S., students like Jason Lin, who received a scholarship from Brandeis University, are carefully weighing the risks against the benefits. They continue to be drawn by the promise of greater academic freedom and the unique cultural "vibe" of American universities, even as they harbor concerns about the political climate.</p>

          <p>A House Ethics Committee report has concluded that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez violated House rules by "impermissibly accepting gifts" related to her 2021 Met Gala attendance. While the committee noted her proactive efforts to comply, it found she failed to pay the full fair market value for some items and accepted free admission for her partner. The report states there was no evidence of intentional underpayment but noted that vendor payments were significantly delayed until after an investigation began. Ocasio-Cortez's office has stated she accepts the ruling and will pay the remaining amounts owed to remedy the issue.</p>

Recent legal rulings have entitled anyone who served between April 2000 and April 2006 to a pension for their entire career, with potential payouts ranging from thousands to over £100,000. While around 16,000 individuals have already come forward, the union is urging others who may qualify to contact their former employers to initiate a claim. The payments are seen as a significant financial benefit, especially given the rising cost of living.</p>
