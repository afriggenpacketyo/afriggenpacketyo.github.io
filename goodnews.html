        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has publicly called for the Cleveland Browns to start rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who is currently third on the depth chart. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce argued that starting Sanders would generate significant excitement and viewership, stating "give the people what they want." His brother, Jason Kelce, offered a counterpoint, defending the Browns' coaching staff for making decisions they believe give the team the best chance to win. The discussion comes amid ongoing public debate and conspiracy theories regarding Sanders' limited playing time and draft position, which some pundits have controversially attributed to league-wide collusion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy reported fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by a modest recovery in sales. However, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and its own business operations. The company noted a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years, with strong performance in mobile phones and gaming, particularly following the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Despite this, Best Buy is still navigating challenges from reduced spending on big-ticket items like appliances amid a tough economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock fall despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The decline was attributed to the company's third-quarter earnings per share guidance, which came in below analyst predictions. Dell's overall revenue growth was significantly boosted by its Servers and Networking division, which includes AI servers, with sales in that segment increasing 69% year-over-year. The company announced it has shipped $10 billion in AI servers in the last two quarters and plans to double that amount in its next fiscal year, highlighting its key role in the booming artificial intelligence infrastructure market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors facing out-of-pocket medical costs not covered by traditional Medicare, several financial tools can help fill the coverage gaps. Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, is specifically designed to pay for expenses like copays and deductibles that Medicare leaves behind. Another option for homeowners aged 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which provides cash payments from home equity without requiring monthly repayments. Additionally, annuities can offer a guaranteed income stream in retirement, providing a reliable source of funds to cover future healthcare costs and ensuring financial peace of mind.

          <p>Intel's Chief Financial Officer, David Zinser, has confirmed the company received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government as part of a deal for the White House to take a 10% stake in the semiconductor firm. The White House press secretary noted that the final details of the agreement are still being finalized by the Department of Commerce. The investment comes as Intel seeks to bolster its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, with Zinser signaling that Intel may also seek outside investment for this unit. In a corporate filing, Intel acknowledged the government deal could potentially generate "adverse reactions" from investors and partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported another quarter of massive sales growth, with revenue surging 56% to nearly $47 billion, driven by unrelenting demand for its AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang projected a multi-trillion dollar market for AI infrastructure by the end of the decade, stating the "AI race is now on." However, this strong performance was overshadowed by investor concerns regarding the company's future in China, as U.S. restrictions on advanced chip sales create significant uncertainty. While management suggested a deal with the Trump administration could allow some sales to resume, the lack of clarity on this key market has tempered enthusiasm for the otherwise stellar results.

          <p>Tennis players Emma Raducanu and Cameron Norrie are set to face formidable challenges in the third round of the US Open. Raducanu, who has shown consistent progress and strong form in her early matches, will test her improved game against Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion and one of the most powerful players on the tour. Meanwhile, Norrie is slated for his seventh career meeting with tennis legend Novak Djokovic. Although Norrie has yet to win a match against Djokovic, he may have his best opportunity yet, as Djokovic has appeared physically vulnerable in his first two rounds after a long break from competition.</p>

          <p>Data storage company Pure Storage saw its shares surge 32% to a record high after reporting strong quarterly results and raising its full-year guidance. A key driver of the positive performance is a major deal with Meta, which has selected Pure as a key storage provider to meet the massive data demands of its artificial intelligence initiatives. Pure has begun recognizing revenue from the Meta deployments and expressed confidence in its expanding relationship with the social media giant. The company noted this success is attracting increased interest from other large-scale "hyperscaler" clients looking for more efficient storage solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans have recently fallen to their lowest point in 2025, making them a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With U.S. home equity levels at a record high, many homeowners have a substantial amount of value to borrow against for needs like renovations or debt consolidation. A key advantage of a home equity loan is its fixed interest rate, which provides protection against future market volatility compared to a variable-rate HELOC. Furthermore, the interest paid on these loans may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for qualifying home improvements, adding to their potential financial benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by adding fresh and perishable items to its existing same-day delivery service in over 1,000 cities. This strategic move allows Prime members to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and other goods for unified, rapid delivery from the company's fulfillment hubs. The initiative leverages Amazon's extensive logistics network, which has been retrofitted with temperature-controlled environments to handle fresh food at scale. While this expansion poses a threat to competitors like Instacart and traditional grocers, analysts note that Amazon's initial selection is limited and that success will depend on further investment.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won a decisive victory in the town's first formal election in at least 60 years. Braxton's win, with 66 votes to his opponent's 26, solidifies his position four years after he was initially locked out of the town hall by the previous all-white leadership. Previously, the town's government positions were handed down without elections, a practice challenged in a federal lawsuit by Black residents. The federally-mandated election marks a significant moment for the majority-Black town and serves as a conclusive resolution to the prolonged dispute over its leadership.</p>

          <p>A financial filing from Nvidia has revealed a significant concentration in its customer base, with two unnamed direct customers accounting for 39% of its revenue in the most recent quarter. "Customer A" and "Customer B" comprised 23% and 16% of total sales, respectively, a notable increase from the previous year. This disclosure is fueling debate about the sustainability of Nvidia's growth, as it suggests a heavy reliance on a few large partners, likely major cloud service providers. While Nvidia's data center business continues to boom, the high level of customer concentration raises concerns for some analysts about potential risks to its future revenue streams.
