          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1 billion for the upcoming Saturday night drawing after no grand prize winner emerged from Wednesday's contest. This marks the sixth time the game's top prize has reached the billion-dollar threshold in its 33-year history. The winner will have the choice between a lump sum cash value of approximately $453.1 million or an annuity paid out over 30 years, both before taxes. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceedingly low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The protest aims to draw attention to a $213 million budget deficit facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which has led to significant service cuts. Kenyatta blames Republican inaction in the state legislature for the funding crisis, which impacts students, seniors, and workers who rely on public transit. The march is intended to highlight the issue and pressure lawmakers to pass one of several bipartisan funding proposals.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, saw their stocks surge significantly this week, suggesting the financial benefits of the AI boom are expanding beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. MongoDB's stock had its best week on record, rallying 44% after reporting strong revenue and customer growth driven by AI-native companies. Similarly, Pure Storage and Snowflake posted strong quarterly results and optimistic forecasts tied to AI data management and services. This trend indicates that downstream software and data infrastructure firms are now beginning to capitalize on enterprise AI adoption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's actions were unlawful. The ruling emphasized that Congress designed the TPS program to be predictable and insulated from shifting political dynamics. The decision provides temporary relief for TPS holders while the legal challenge against the termination continues.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 concluded a strong month of August with a slight downturn, ending a four-week winning streak but still posting a monthly gain of over 2%. The week's decline was partly driven by a dip in Nvidia's stock following its highly anticipated earnings report, as investors took profits. Economic data showed that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, rose 2.9% year-over-year, its highest rate since February. Despite this, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Meta to Modify AI Chatbot Responses for Teens Following Senate Probe into Inappropriate Conversations</h2>

          <p>Meta has announced it is implementing temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenage users, following a Senate investigation into reports of "romantic" and "sensual" conversations. The company will now train its AI to avoid engaging on topics like self-harm and disordered eating, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move comes after a Reuters report and a risk assessment from Common Sense Media raised significant safety concerns, with the latter group recommending no one under 18 use the system. The changes are an interim measure as Meta works on longer-term safety protections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but with new restrictions on eligibility. Previously available to nearly everyone six months and older, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable to the virus. This change in guidance marks a significant shift in the nation's public health strategy for managing COVID-19, moving from broad vaccination to a more targeted approach.</p>

          <p>With over a third of U.S. Senate seats up for election in 2026, the political landscape for control of the chamber is beginning to take shape. Democrats face a challenging map, defending 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, many in solidly conservative states. Key contests are anticipated in North Carolina, where a retiring Republican creates an open seat, and Georgia, where incumbent Jon Ossoff is seen as vulnerable. Other potential battlegrounds include New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ohio, with contentious primaries and high-profile candidates already emerging in several states.</p>

          <p>Shares of the buy-now, pay-later company Affirm rose 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share and a 33% year-over-year revenue increase to $876 million. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to increased transaction frequency and growth in both consumer and merchant numbers. Despite concerns about losing Walmart as a partner, the company's gross merchandise volume grew 44%, boosted by its partnerships with Amazon and Shopify.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock jumped nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by its cloud computing unit, which saw revenue grow 26% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter. The company stated that robust demand for artificial intelligence services was a key factor, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the growth in the high-margin cloud business and signs of revival in e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a Pacific Palisades homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can investigate State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's rate-increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. The ruling combines the issues, ensuring that the company's service to customers is considered alongside its request for higher rates.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from the Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who joined United in 2022 for a near-record fee of £81.3 million, had a disappointing tenure at the club after a promising start. He spent the latter half of last season on loan at Betis, where he rediscovered his form. The permanent transfer marks the end of his time at Old Trafford and is part of a broader squad overhaul under manager Ruben Amorim.</p>
