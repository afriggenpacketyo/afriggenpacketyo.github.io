          <p>A skull discovered in the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary, may belong to Matthias Corvinus, the medieval king of Hungary and Croatia. Facial reconstruction specialist Emese G√°bor found morphological similarities between the skull and that of Corvinus' son. Greenish discoloration suggests a metal crown was once worn, and physical features match Corvinus' age and height. Further research, including DNA and isotope analyses, is planned to learn more about the skull's origins.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a major website dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after losing support from a critical service provider. The site was known as a prominent marketplace for deepfake porn, including both celebrities and private individuals. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery, including deepfakes. Experts like Henry Ajder celebrate the closure as a step in the right direction, though they acknowledge the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will persist.</p>
