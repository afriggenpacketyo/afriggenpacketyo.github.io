        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Romanian presidential election saw Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-European mayor, elected as president, owing significantly to the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship. These groups, particularly ethnic Hungarians who defied Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's support for a hard-right candidate with anti-Hungarian sentiments, voted overwhelmingly for Dan, contributing substantially to his victory. This outcome underscores the importance of minority groups in preserving liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic trajectory. The Republic of Moldova is highly impacted by Russian aggression, so the election of Dan is a huge win for them.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles leaving depots, as refuse workers continue their strike action. The authority estimates that over 12,000 tonnes of waste have accumulated due to disruptions caused by pickets, leading to concerns about public health. The strike, now in its 11th week, centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The court order is intended to ensure waste collection services can resume, addressing the growing piles of uncollected refuse bags.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) has denounced the Enhanced Games, a competition that endorses the use of banned substances, and called on the global sports community to oppose it. The Enhanced Games, set to debut in Las Vegas in May 2026, includes events like swimming, athletics, and weightlifting for athletes using performance-enhancing drugs. CHINADA criticized the event as a distorted competition that turns sports into a drug contest, threatening athletes' health and the spirit of sport.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect and warned that the EU stands ready to defend its interests.

While AI enhances trade policy, it does not replace it, transforming global trade from a reactive challenge into a proactive, data-driven advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are embracing "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. This trend marks a shift from previous generations who prioritized company loyalty and long hours, with young workers now seeking more "me time" and questioning the sacrifices made by their parents. Experts attribute this change to factors like cost-cutting by companies, the impact of the pandemic, and a desire to avoid the overwork culture that led to "karoshi," or death by overwork.</p>
