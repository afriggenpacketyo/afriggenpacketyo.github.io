          <p>Elon Musk announced his departure from the Trump administration after leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressing gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. His departure follows criticism of Trump's budget bill and its impact on the federal deficit. Musk's time in government saw significant job cuts in the federal workforce, though some were blocked by federal judges. He plans to return to running his companies.</p>

          <p>In response to intensified immigration enforcement, the Latino community in the U.S. is increasingly seeking naturalization. USCIS reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with numbers rising further in 2025. Community organizations and legal offices report increased interest in citizenship, driven by concerns about deportation and a desire to participate in upcoming elections. Academics note that this trend offers an opportunity to counter political attacks on immigrants and strengthen democracy.</p>
