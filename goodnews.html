The organization provides free, three-week courses that teach essential skills and offer comprehensive support, such as assistance with childcare and transportation, to remove barriers to employment. By partnering with local companies like Talan Products, Magnet has helped fill thousands of open manufacturing positions in the state. The article highlights a personal success story, demonstrating the program's profound impact on retooling lives and strengthening the local workforce.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have mutually agreed to extend a pause on certain tariffs for an additional 90 days, continuing a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute. The U.S. president confirmed the extension via an executive order, stating that all other elements of their existing agreement will remain unchanged. China’s Commerce Ministry subsequently announced it would also suspend its additional tariffs on U.S. goods for the same period. This move provides a brief window of stability, delaying the re-escalation of trade tensions between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 20:06:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a highly unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their sales of specific AI chips to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses, allowing the companies to sell advanced chips like Nvidia's H20 to the Chinese market, a practice previously restricted due to national security concerns. The president described the deal as a negotiation that benefits the country, though the arrangement of a direct revenue share for export licenses is unprecedented. The move aims to balance corporate interests with geopolitical strategy in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City, scientists are using an innovative technique to track the critically endangered axolotl, a unique species of salamander. Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are filtering water to detect environmental DNA (eDNA), or genetic traces left behind by the elusive creatures. This method has become crucial as traditional net surveys often come up empty, with the wild population having plummeted from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014. The eDNA has confirmed their presence in protected refuge areas, offering a sliver of hope for the species' resilience if its habitat can be restored.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has commented on the agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their China AI chip revenue, arguing the move is not as novel as it seems. He characterized the arrangement as "just another form of tariff" and suggested it is a relatively benign way for the government to be involved in business, comparing it to past government investments in companies like Chrysler. Cramer believes the most important aspect of the deal is that the U.S. reversed its initial ban, allowing the companies to compete in the Chinese market. He concluded that the deal is good for both the taxpayers and the companies involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu lost a hard-fought, three-hour match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open. The final score was 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, with Sabalenka just edging out the British player in a tense final-set tiebreak. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is being seen as another strong sign of her resurgence, demonstrating she can compete at the highest level against the world's best players. The competitive display, which pushed the defending champion to her limit, is a positive indicator for Raducanu ahead of the upcoming US Open.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, extending their partnership with the streaming giant. However, the new "first-look" arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content. Under the new pact, the couple will continue to develop film and television projects, including a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel. The original partnership produced several high-profile projects, including the popular docuseries "Harry & Meghan."</p>

          <p>A new 51-story residential skyscraper has received approval from the Los Angeles City Council for a location in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The proposed tower is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer, Mack Real Estate Development, has not provided a timeline for construction. Urban development experts note that despite high housing demand, challenges such as high interest rates, rising material costs, and labor uncertainties are making it difficult for new large-scale construction projects to begin.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered a standout performance to help the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory against the London Spirit. Baker's impressive opening spell, where he bowled with significant pace and swing, restricted the Spirit's chase and troubled veteran international batters. His efforts were crucial in defending their total of 163-6, a score bolstered by a quickfire 29 from 20-year-old Ben McKinney on his debut. Baker's performance earned him player of the match and high praise from his captain and commentators.</p>

          <p>The president has announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars imported from Switzerland and other countries. The customs ruling had caused the price of gold to hit a record high, as it would have impacted bars used to back contracts on the main futures market. Following the president's announcement on social media, gold futures saw a significant drop. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had previously warned the ruling could negatively impact the global flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>
