          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump posted on social media that Russia's economic troubles present an opportunity for Kyiv to reclaim its original borders with European and NATO support. This marks a departure from his earlier suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lauded a "big shift" in U.S. President Donald Trump's position after Trump declared Ukraine could win back all its territory. Zelenskyy suggested the change came from Trump being better informed about the battlefield reality and Russia's economic struggles. However, the reaction within Ukraine is mixed, with some parliament members expressing cautious optimism while others view it as the U.S. washing its hands of the war rather than a commitment to victory.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, experts and players are analyzing how Team Europe can overcome the challenge of winning on American soil, a feat not accomplished since 2012. Key strategies include mentally preparing for a hostile "bear pit" crowd, leveraging the continuity of an almost unchanged team, and relying on the experience of captain Luke Donald. The European side hopes to silence the home crowd with a strong start, drawing on the experience of veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an emotional monologue criticizing what he called "anti-American" threats to free speech following his brief suspension. The controversy arose from his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and Kimmel clarified it was never his intention to make light of the murder. He also criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr for threatening ABC's broadcast licenses, while many local affiliate stations continued to preempt his show upon its return.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year with the help of a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as illegitimate Bounce Back Loans. The Cabinet Office announced the AI tool, which scans policies for potential weaknesses, will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia, to help them combat similar fraud.</p>

The judge stated the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of surrendering its employee's rights to appease a lobby group.</p>
