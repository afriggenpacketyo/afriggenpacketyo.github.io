          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported better-than-expected first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that U.S.-China trade tensions could limit global container market volumes. The company's underlying EBITDA rose 70% year-over-year, reaching $2.71 billion. Maersk maintained its 2025 profit guidance between $6 billion and $9 billion but revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The revised outlook reflects concerns over the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and retaliatory measures from China on global trade flows.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is anticipated to announce a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, potentially easing investor concerns about global tariffs. The UK government has suggested lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies to secure the deal. Since taking office, the Trump administration has expanded US tariff policies, including a 145% levy on Chinese imports. The UK, eager for post-Brexit trade deals, sees an agreement with the US as crucial, while officials from the US and China are set to meet in Switzerland to address their trade war.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with President Trump. The news of an imminent trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain. Britain, even under a center-left Labour government, has escaped the harsh criticism that Mr. Trump has trained on the European Union and China, both of which he accuses of ‚Äúripping off‚Äù the United States in their trade relationships.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. The forecast comes as Nintendo reported a decline in revenue and profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, largely due to consumers awaiting the new console. Nintendo also noted that its forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective as of April 10. The company had to delay pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of tariffs on countries where its consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam, potentially impacting profits.</p>

          <p>The UK government has secured a trade deal with the US, a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, particularly after recent local election setbacks. This agreement follows a full free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to boost bilateral trade and UK GDP. President Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, though the specifics are likely more limited than a comprehensive free trade deal. The UK aims to reduce tariffs on British steel and cars, while the US seeks concessions on pharmaceuticals and technology, which constitute a major portion of goods exports.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the deceased author Agatha Christie has been created using artificial intelligence to "teach" an online writing course, raising ethical questions about using AI to resurrect and represent the dead. While Christie's family estate approved the project and ensured her own words were used, some critics argue that it is still a "deepfake" because Christie herself cannot consent. The course coincides with ongoing debates about AI ethics, particularly regarding copyright law and the use of AI to generate content. The article explores the implications of such posthumous representations and their impact on the author's legacy.</p>

The deal is seen as a significant win for both nations, particularly for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has cultivated a relationship with Trump.

While critics question his views on sentencing and punishment, Timpson emphasizes his commitment to rehabilitating offenders and reducing re-offending. The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison and is considering increased tagging, with a new study suggesting curfew tags can reduce reoffending by 20%.</p>
