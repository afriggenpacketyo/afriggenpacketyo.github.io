          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia. Despite a difficult start where Australia scored first, England recovered to extend their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scored two tries for England in the decisive win. The team will now face Scotland in the next round, though concerns remain over injuries sustained by key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman during the match.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham showcased the party's significant growth and increasing professionalization, drawing comparisons to major party gatherings. The event, much larger than the previous year's, retained an insurgent energy while adopting the conventions of established political parties, such as corporate sponsorship and a large venue. Leader Nigel Farage's speech emphasized the need for discipline and grassroots organization, reflecting a focused ambition to win the next general election. The article suggests the party is successfully scaling up its operations while attracting a diverse base of new members, many of whom are disaffected former Conservative voters.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a significant reshuffle of his government, with major changes occurring at the Home Office. Following the move of Yvette Cooper to the Foreign Office, ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have also been moved to different departments. This shake-up, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration. Several other junior and state ministerial positions have been changed, including the appointment of business executive Jason Stockwood to a business minister role.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his future presidential library and museum. A 13-person board, including former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti, has been appointed to oversee the project's fundraising and development. The decision to build in Delaware, the state that launched his political career, comes as the foundation faces the significant challenge of raising funds in a divided political climate. The cost of presidential libraries has escalated in recent decades, with the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago having a fundraising goal of $1.6 billion.</p>

          <p>A new conservation effort is set to begin at Point Reyes National Seashore in California after a landmark settlement resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens up over 16,000 acres for a five-year restoration project aimed at reviving native ecosystems. A key and somewhat controversial part of the plan involves using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plant species and promote the regrowth of native grasses. The project is seen as a significant experiment in balancing conservation with agricultural history on public lands.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Shares Five Key Facts About Proper Sunscreen Application and Importance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dermatologist emphasizes that applying sunscreen should be as routine as brushing one's teeth, yet many Americans neglect this daily habit. Key advice includes ensuring application on often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, which are highly susceptible to sun damage. While SPF 30 is recommended, higher SPFs can compensate for the fact that most people do not apply a sufficient amount. Sun protection is a year-round necessity, not just for summer, as cumulative damage can lead to skin conditions later in life. Consistent daily use is the most effective way to protect the skin.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event that participants described as a celebration of a newfound acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the group, delivering a homily that emphasized restoring dignity to marginalized people, for which he received a standing ovation. Many pilgrims credit the late Pope Francis for the significant shift in tone, citing his message of welcome and his departure from the more condemnatory stances of his predecessors. This event stands in stark contrast to the experience of LGBTQ+ pilgrims during the last Holy Year 25 years ago, who reported being detained.</p>

          <p>As more states and school districts implement bans on cellphones in classrooms, many are turning to a solution from the company Yondr: a locked magnetic pouch. Students are required to place their phones in the pouch upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. The system is now in use for at least 2.5 million students across the U.S. While educators report a positive change in student engagement and a reduction in distractions, the implementation has been met with mixed reactions from students and debates over the cost, which can be up to $30 per student.</p>

Now, a team of forensic genealogists is working on what they call the "ultimate cold case" to identify these forgotten soldiers using advanced DNA analysis and family tree research. By building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones, they have found tens of thousands of living genetic matches. The project aims to restore the names and identities of these first American soldiers, and the team is asking for potential descendants to submit DNA to aid the investigation.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening emergencies such as extreme weather or terror attacks. During the test, compatible phones will emit a siren sound and vibrate for about 10 seconds. This follows a previous test in April 2023 that experienced some technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed. Users have the option to opt out of receiving these alerts through their phone's settings.</p>
