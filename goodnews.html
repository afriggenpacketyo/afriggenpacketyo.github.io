          <p>China's Ping An Bank is leveraging the popularity of Pop Mart's Labubu dolls to attract young customers amid intense competition in the retail banking sector. New clients who open a savings account and deposit over 50,000 yuan for at least three months may receive a Labubu blind box. The campaign has gone viral on social media, with users expressing excitement over the free collectible. This strategy reflects the struggle of Chinese retail banks to attract and retain young customers amid low interest rates and a declining retail banking customer base, as the country's population ages and income levels decrease. </p>

          <p>Japan aims to reduce the estimated death toll from a potential megaquake in the Nankai Trough by around 80% over the next 10 years.

The revised plan emphasizes rigorous monitoring of progress across proposed measures, including ensuring local governments release hazard maps and conduct evacuation drills.

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles to curb elevated prices of the staple food, according to farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold through direct contracts with retailers. The move will leave the country with a rice reserve of around 100,000 tons, down from about 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks. The government hopes that the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices and address public frustration over rising costs.</p>

          <p>Japan lags behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in raising the share of women in leadership positions, according to a government report. The report acknowledges that Japan's efforts remain insufficient, as the country ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index. The government aims to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across a range of fields. The government also adopted its latest basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment, with a focus on local economies and small businesses.</p>
