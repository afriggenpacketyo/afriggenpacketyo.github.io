          <h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Launches Amid Fan Excitement and Supply Constraints</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has launched globally, marked by midnight store openings and high demand, with some retailers reporting record pre-orders. Despite initial excitement, Game cancelled some pre-orders, and Nintendo briefly paused pre-orders in the U.S. due to tariff concerns. The Switch 2 represents a strategic shift for Nintendo, being a direct sequel and retaining the hybrid console design, boasting a larger screen and improved performance. The console launches with Mario Kart World, while upgraded versions of Zelda games will also be available, and gamers can also look forward to third-party titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is evaluating the potential purchase of Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets, the same model that reportedly downed a French-built Rafale warplane during a recent conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Indonesia‚Äôs deputy minister of defence, China offered to sell the jets during a recent arms fair, and the country is considering the offer. Indonesia could procure defense equipment from any nation, but the government must consider integrating new planes with existing equipment. Earlier this year, China and Indonesia committed to enhancing military cooperation, conducting a joint drill in November of the previous year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has stated that an error in car tax data caused the April inflation rate to be overstated by 0.1 percentage points. The ONS initially reported the annual rate at 3.5%, but revised data shows the consumer price index rose by 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The error involved incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, overstating the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration. The ONS apologized for the error and said it would use the correctly weighted data from May 2025's figures onward, meaning no further statistics will be affected.</p>

          <p>The U.S. anticipates that NATO members will likely reach a higher defense spending target, with discussions ongoing ahead of the upcoming summit. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that a target of 5% of member nations' GDPs for defense spending "will happen," aligning with President Trump's call to increase the current 2% requirement. While some members, such as Poland and Estonia, already exceed the 2% target, others, including Canada and Italy, lag behind. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expects allies to decide on the spending target at the June summit.</p>

The new console includes features such as screen sharing, voice chat, a larger screen, and 4K output on televisions, along with the release of the "Mario Kart World" game.

The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May, with Brazilian imports to the United States subject to a 10% tariff since April.

          <p>Louisiana's legislature has passed a law outlawing attempts to gain children‚Äôs trust with the intent to commit sexual assault, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker. The law makes it illegal to pursue an intimate relationship with a child under 17 through manipulation, threats, or coercion with the intent to commit a sex offense. The law applies when offenders are at least four years older than the child, even if no abuse has occurred. The effort was inspired by the experience of Tim Gioe, who was abused by a priest, and aims to prevent similar cases by allowing authorities to intervene earlier.</p>
