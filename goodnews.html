          <p>BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are entering the European market, challenging established automakers like Volkswagen and Renault in the small car segment. BYD recently launched its Dolphin Surf compact hatchback in Europe, priced competitively to attract consumers. This move signifies BYD's intention to explore the small car segment, which has significant potential for electrification. The entry of Chinese EVs presents both an opportunity for European consumers to access affordable options and a challenge for European carmakers to develop competitive small cars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India explored shifting from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential system, according to historian Srinath Raghavan. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, Gandhi's aides proposed a strong presidency to bypass parliamentary constraints and an "obstructionist" judiciary. While the shift never fully materialized, the Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review, reflecting a move towards a powerful executive. After Gandhi's defeat in 1977, subsequent amendments reversed some of these changes, but the idea resurfaced in 1982, highlighting the ongoing debate about India's governance structure.</p>
