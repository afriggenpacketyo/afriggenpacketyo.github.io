          <p>A time capsule buried by Princess Diana in 1991 at Great Ormond Street Hospital has been opened, revealing items like a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, and a passport. The capsule, intended to represent 1990s life, was unearthed earlier than planned to make way for a new children's cancer center. Selected by competition-winning children with Princess Diana's help, the contents offer a nostalgic glimpse into the era. Despite some damage, the items are largely intact, providing a unique historical record.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a decline in leisure travel to the United States in the first half of 2025, while business travel remains stable and robust. The U.S. was the top global destination for business travelers, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly more than Germany or the UK. This trend suggests that corporate interests in the U.S. are unaffected by broader negative travel sentiments observed in other regions. The slight increase in inbound business travel volume aligns with seasonal patterns, despite ongoing tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial companies experienced a slower decline in profits in July, falling 1.5% year-on-year, marking the least contraction since May. This improvement is attributed to government efforts to curb overcapacity and aggressive price competition among producers. While the manufacturing sector saw profits rise by 6.8%, the mining sector continued to decline. Statistician Yu Weining noted that policy measures promoting a rebound in prices are contributing to corporate profitability, though overall profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflation.

          <p>Bain Capital, the controlling shareholder of luxury parka maker Canada Goose, has received take-private bids valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International, along with a consortium including Bosideng International, have made offers as Bain seeks to offload its holding. The move to privatize is seen as a way to allow buyers greater autonomy to revitalize the company, which has struggled with growth in key markets like China and faced questions about its brand positioning and marketing strategy.

          <p>China's Tiangong space station is making significant strides in space research, particularly in the study of ultra-high-temperature materials, surpassing the International Space Station (ISS) in some areas. Experiments conducted in Tiangong's container-free laboratory cabinet use electrostatic levitation to heat tiny metal samples to extreme temperatures, eliminating contamination risks. This research, led by physicist Hu Liang, aims to develop better tungsten alloys for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles. The successful operation of the four-year-old device demonstrates its reliability for advanced aerospace applications.</p>

          <p>As Angel Stadium approaches its 60th anniversary, the city of Anaheim is initiating an assessment to determine the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to ensure its long-term viability beyond the Angels' lease, which expires in 2032. City Manager Jim Vanderpool confirmed no current long-term discussions are underway between the city and the team. This move follows the cancellation of a 2022 deal for Angels owner Arte Moreno to purchase the stadium and surrounding land. A finalized assessment of the facility's condition is expected by mid-2026.</p>

          <p>As the 2026 midterm elections approach, key Senate contests are taking shape, with Democrats aiming to flip four seats to gain a majority against 53 Republican incumbents. Over a third of Senate seats are up for election, including 13 Democratic and 24 Republican defenses. The political map presents challenges for Democrats, as many Republican incumbents are in states won by Donald Trump in 2024. However, the retirement of three Democratic senators creates open seats, while contentious primary challenges in states like North Carolina and Texas are expected to be high-stakes battles.</p>
