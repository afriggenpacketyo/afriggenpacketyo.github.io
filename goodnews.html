          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team has secured a spot in the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2002 after defeating Fiji. Francesca McGhie scored two tries, bringing her tournament total to five, while Rhona Lloyd also added a double. Despite a spirited effort from Fiji, which scored three tries of its own, a stunning individual score from Emma Orr helped seal the victory for the Scots. The win sets up a decisive Pool B match against Canada next weekend, marking a significant achievement for the Scottish team on the international stage.</p>

          <p>A baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, a New Jersey Little Leaguer who was famously suspended for a celebratory bat flip, has sold for $9,882 at auction. The incident, which occurred during a sectional tournament final, led to a legal challenge that successfully overturned the suspension, allowing him to play in the state tournament. All proceeds from the auction will be donated to his Haddonfield Little League program. The bat flip gained national attention, drawing support from Major League Baseball players and even being commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo collaborated in a concert titled “Sarabande Africaine,” exploring the African origins of the Baroque sarabande dance rhythm. The performance at the Hollywood Bowl showcased a fusion of musical traditions, with the artists reinterpreting works from Bach and Handel to Philip Glass and Ravel through an African lens. Kidjo transformed classics like Gershwin's “Summertime” into Swahili, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, background harmony. The event was a celebration of cross-cultural understanding, demonstrating how diverse musical languages can create a shared, compelling experience for a large audience.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to $1 billion for Saturday night's drawing, the sixth-largest prize in the game's history, after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. The odds of matching all six numbers to claim the jackpot are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity for the full amount or a lump-sum cash option, which is valued at just under half the advertised prize. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with further taxes likely due, and most states also levy their own income taxes on lottery prizes.</p>

          <p>Receding water levels in Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery was made by archaeologists in the Khanke region of Duhok province as a severe, five-year drought grips the country. While the drought has had devastating impacts on agriculture and electricity, it has created opportunities for excavation work in areas that are typically submerged. The tombs, thought to date back to the Hellenistic period, are being carefully excavated for preservation at the Duhok Museum before water levels are expected to rise again.</p>

          <p>The engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and football player Travis Kelce has become a focal point for a variety of cultural and political interpretations. This commentary article explores how different groups are projecting their own narratives onto the event, from conservatives hoping it will "deradicalize" Swift to some fans celebrating Kelce's perceived support for her success. The author notes the wide spectrum of reactions, including JD Vance's conspiracy theory about rigged NFL games, and contrasts the media frenzy with the lack of celebrity attention on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The engagement is framed as a cultural Rorschach test, revealing more about the commentators than the couple themselves.</p>
