          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will investigate the violent 1984 clash between police and miners known as the 'Battle of Orgreave.' Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for over 40 years regarding the events and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Campaigners, who have long sought this investigation, expressed cautious optimism, hoping it will finally bring truth and justice to the affected mining communities. The inquiry will be chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield and will examine both the confrontation and the controversial evidence used against the miners.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare-earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June following a preliminary trade agreement that eased Beijing's export licensing requirements. These magnets are critical components for high-tech industries, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and China dominates over 90% of the global market. The increase in shipments provides relief to American and European companies that faced production disruptions due to shortages caused by the earlier restrictions. This development highlights China's significant leverage in the global supply chain for these essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a temporary, system-wide ground stop on Sunday evening due to a significant IT outage. The grounding of the fleet lasted for approximately three hours before operations were resumed.

The carrier apologized for the inconvenience but did not immediately provide details on the cause of the computer system failure.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past $50 billion. This surge, up from just $10 billion at the start of last year, is driven by a search for low-risk investments amid economic uncertainty and persistent deflationary pressures. These ETFs offer advantages like lower costs, better liquidity, and diversified exposure compared to direct bond investments. The trend reflects growing investor demand for stable, fixed-income assets as China's central bank maintains loose monetary conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical railway and port infrastructure projects led by Chinese firms. For years, logistical challenges, particularly the lack of rail links from remote mines to coastal ports, have hindered these African nations from exporting their vast iron ore deposits. The new infrastructure, including a line to Guinea's massive Simandou mine, will overcome these bottlenecks. This development is expected to significantly boost the economies of Guinea and Algeria while securing a new supply source for China.</p>

Huawei's 'full-stack' approach, from developing its own Ascend AI processors to deploying industry-specific AI applications, has turned it into a national champion for China's technological ambitions. This transformation was ironically accelerated by U.S. trade restrictions, which forced the company to innovate and diversify its business.</p>
