          <p>Country music star Mark Chesnutt was hospitalized in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after experiencing a low sodium count and extremely high blood pressure, forcing the cancellation of several upcoming concerts. This health issue follows a previous emergency quadruple bypass surgery he underwent in 2024, from which he had been recovering at his home in Texas. His representative stated that he is currently in stable condition and has apologized to fans for the missed performances. The singer hopes to reschedule the canceled shows in Louisiana and New Mexico in the near future.</p>

          <p>In response to recent market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends income funds that utilize options-based strategies for risk-averse investors. These funds are designed to offer more reliable downside protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is relevant as policymakers consider rate cuts. The article suggests that demand for such strategies, which offer both income and defense against equity drawdowns, is growing. Investors are advised to seek funds managed by experienced professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to settle down, a new study from DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial stability was a primary motivator for men. Experts suggest this trend may also be linked to men's reliance on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support, whereas women often maintain stronger support networks through friendships and family.</p>

          <p>Efforts have commenced to repair the damaged external power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog. The plant, which is Europe's largest, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks, a situation that poses significant safety risks. The International Atomic Energy Agency stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. Restoring a stable off-site power connection is considered critical for cooling the facility's shutdown reactors and preventing a potential nuclear incident.</p>

          <p>Amid rising suicide rates among Black men, community-led initiatives are creating safe spaces for them to discuss mental health and vulnerability. Groups like 'Mental Health Is Real Wealth' in Los Angeles provide a forum where Black men can share their experiences with stress, depression, and the societal pressures they face without judgment. Psychologists note that Black men are less likely to seek professional help and often face culturally incompetent care when they do. These support groups serve as a crucial outlet and a gateway to therapy, helping participants break generational cycles and foster emotional expression in a supportive environment.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) following a significant drop in the beverage company's stock price. The decline was triggered by KDP's announcement of a merger with JDE Peet's, a move that surprised investors who had been advocating for a simpler separation of KDP's coffee and beverage assets. The deal's structure is seen as highly favorable to JAB Holdings, which has a controlling interest in JDE Peet's and was formerly the majority owner of KDP.

To prepare for this, she advises parents to begin conversations about responsible technology use when children are in late elementary school. Key strategies include teaching kids about online privacy, the value of their time, and setting firm rules such as no phones in bedrooms overnight.
