          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a period of political uncertainty. Her victory was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, shifting the governing bloc's political stance further to the right. Takaichi, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the pacifist constitution. She faces immediate challenges, including public frustration over rising prices and the need to stabilize her new, untested government.</p>

          <p>Several major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, have raised their economic growth forecasts for China, citing stronger-than-expected data from the third quarter. Goldman Sachs increased its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 from 4.8% to 4.9%, stating that the government's official target of "around 5%" is largely on track. This optimistic revision comes despite ongoing domestic and international economic pressures. The adjustment reflects growing confidence among foreign banks in the resilience of China's economy and its ability to navigate current challenges while maintaining stable growth momentum.

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Sean Dyche as their new manager, signing the former Burnley and Everton boss to a contract lasting until 2027. Dyche becomes the club's third manager this season, replacing Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed after just 39 days and failed to secure a single win in eight games. The club, currently in the relegation zone, is turning to Dyche's experience in managing teams under pressure to stabilize their performance and secure their Premier League status. His appointment is seen as a pragmatic move to bring tactical discipline and resilience to the struggling team.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly closing the gap with the United States in the artificial intelligence race, driven by a combination of state-backed investment, intense domestic competition, and a focus on open-source models. Beijing has declared its ambition to be the world's leading AI power by 2030, and Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are launching powerful, cost-effective large language models that rival Western counterparts. While the US maintains a lead in frontier research and advanced chips, China is leveraging its massive domestic market and exporting AI infrastructure to gain a global foothold, creating a new dynamic in the global tech landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal's Declan Rice has successfully transitioned from a traditional holding midfielder to a more dynamic box-to-box role, significantly boosting his offensive contributions. The addition of deep-lying midfielder Martin Zubimendi this summer has further enabled this evolution, allowing Rice to leverage his running power to join attacks while maintaining a deep starting position. This tactical shift has made him a leader in key attacking metrics for the team, including ball carries and chances created. His development has been praised by figures like Patrick Vieira and is also benefiting the England national team, where he plays a similar advanced role.</p>

          <p>Oracle is being highlighted as a strong candidate to join the exclusive group of companies with a $2 trillion market capitalization, largely driven by its expanding role in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's recent performance shows a massive surge in its remaining performance obligation, or backlog, indicating strong future demand for its services from its existing base of Fortune 500 clients. Analysts project significant annual revenue growth, suggesting that its integral position in the IT ecosystem and the generative AI boom could propel its valuation to this milestone before the decade's end.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Australia has identified two protein enzymes that are critical for the growth and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. Their research uncovered a key mechanism that regulates the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease's progression. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy to combat prostate cancer. The disease affects an estimated 1.5 million men globally each year, making the development of more effective treatments a significant priority for medical researchers.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Australia's science agency, CSIRO, have discovered several new species during a deep-sea exploration voyage off the coast of Western Australia. Among the findings are the West Australian Lantern Shark, a small, bioluminescent shark found over 600 meters below the surface, and a new type of tiny, semi-transparent porcelain crab. The expedition highlights the rich biodiversity in Australia's largely unexplored marine parks. Scientists estimate that hundreds more specimens collected during the voyage have yet to be formally described, a process that can take years to complete.</p>

One company reported that yuan-settled orders now constitute 10 to 20 percent of its total exports, a significant increase from last year. This shift is partly driven by Chinese-led infrastructure projects abroad, which encourage the use of the yuan and support Beijing's broader goal of internationalizing its currency.</p>

The goal is to restore the area's coral ecosystem, which was lost decades ago, while also creating an ecotourism attraction accessible to snorkelers. Funded by the city and private donations, the first phase includes an underwater traffic jam of 22 concrete cars designed to act as "flowerpots for corals."</p>
