          <p>HSBC's co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, David Liao, stated that Hong Kong can play a crucial role in the internationalization of the yuan by expanding its offshore liquidity while maintaining strong safeguards and effective risk management. According to an HSBC survey, many mainland businesses plan to expand overseas, and both institutional and retail investors intend to diversify their portfolios by allocating assets abroad. Liao highlighted that Hong Kong is often the top choice for choosing financing channels and locations. He suggested scaling up yuan-denominated trade finance, noting the yuan is now the third most used currency for global trade finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing innovative solutions to adapt to a warmer world and increased rainfall, including rain tunnels and "sponge parks." Following a devastating storm in 2011, the city launched a $1.3 billion project to mitigate flooding. Key initiatives include the Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel and the transformation of green spaces into reservoirs. The city's long-term climate adaptation planning has gained international recognition, with Copenhagen consulting with cities worldwide on similar infrastructure projects. These projects aim to manage excess rainwater and protect the city from storm surges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of taking apart buildings piece by piece to salvage reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach reduces landfill waste and lowers the carbon footprint of construction by creating a circular economy for building materials. Cities like Portland and Boulder are leading the way, but challenges remain, including the need for local infrastructure to process and distribute salvaged materials. While deconstruction can be more expensive, some developers see long-term benefits in attracting eco-conscious buyers and reducing environmental impact.</p>

The rumor stemmed from an amendment proposed by Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove that failed to pass. The article clarifies that while Republicans voted against the amendment, Noem did not testify about it, and the claim is false. The article also provides context about Noem's appearances before Congress to discuss the DHS budget.</p>
