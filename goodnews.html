While Canadians are generally indifferent to the monarchy, Carney aims to highlight Canada's distinct identity and history.

          <p>Hong Kong's education bureau is encouraging its universities to attract "top talent" affected by the Trump administration's attempt to ban Harvard from enrolling international students. This appeal comes after Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification was revoked, effectively barring the university from accepting foreign students, although a judge temporarily blocked the ban. Hong Kong universities, including the Hong Kong Science and Technology University, are offering support to affected students. The move is seen as an opportunity for Hong Kong to enhance its global competitiveness in higher education.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price cuts on multiple electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, effective until the end of June, are aimed at boosting sales amidst increasing competition in the Chinese EV market. Analysts expect the price cuts to drive increased foot traffic to BYD dealerships, but other Chinese automakers also saw declines in their share prices as investors became cautious. Citi analysts, however, remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan.</p>
