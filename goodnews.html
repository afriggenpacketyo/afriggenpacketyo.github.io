        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan faced hours of suspension due to a non-operational train halting between stations. The JR East reported that the train stopped in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo, around 11:25 a.m., leading to service disruptions on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line between Tokyo and Sendai stations. Passengers on one of the affected trains were transferred using a gangplank to another train, while the other train returned to Utsunomiya Station. Service resumed at 5 p.m. after inspections were conducted. The incident underscores the challenges in maintaining the reliability of high-speed rail infrastructure. </p>

Parents and teachers should avoid overemphasizing the world's dangers and instead foster a sense of purpose, meaning, and independence in children. Additionally, rising rates of cannabis use among young people may exacerbate mental health issues. </p>
