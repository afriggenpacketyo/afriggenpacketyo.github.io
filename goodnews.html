          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 20:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, below economists' forecasts, with the impact of President Trump's tariffs remaining muted. Economists had expected a 3.1% increase, and the Department of Labor made an exception to the government shutdown to release the CPI data. Inflation is inching higher partly due to tariffs, with businesses absorbing some costs, but companies are also passing on a portion of import taxes to consumers. The recent rise in inflation complicates the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates (not investment advice). The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a pause in the province's anti-tariff ad campaign in the U.S. after President Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations with Canada. The ad, featuring excerpts from a Ronald Reagan speech criticizing tariffs, drew Trump's ire, leading him to declare an end to trade talks. Ford stated that the ad's intention was to spark a conversation about the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. Despite the pause, the ad will continue to air over the weekend, including during the World Series games (not investment advice). The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki's walkout music, "Báilalo Rocky," has become a Latin hit, embraced by fans and giving the song a global boost. Veteran second baseman Miguel Rojas introduced Sasaki to the song during spring training, and it quickly became a dugout favorite. The song's infectious dembow-house beat and Spanish hook invite listeners to dance, creating a unique and energetic atmosphere. Sasaki's success as a reliever has further amplified the song's popularity, solidifying its status as the breakout hit of the fall. The optimism score is 85.</p>

          <p>As the clocks go back and winter approaches, strategies to cope with Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad) become crucial, especially in areas with minimal daylight. Symptoms of Sad include low mood, irritability, and loss of interest in activities, affecting over a million people in the UK. The 'Living with Sad' project encourages outdoor activities and 'light routines,' while Orkney islanders are offered therapeutic lamps. Scandinavian nations provide inspiration with cozy interior lighting, and a shift towards enjoying winter can significantly improve mental health. The optimism score is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of MPs has advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. The Treasury Select Committee believes that cutting the allowance is unlikely to promote an investment culture in the UK. Savers can currently put up to £20,000 a year in ISAs, protecting the returns from being taxed. The committee's report concluded that reducing the cash ISA allowance would not incentivize people to invest in stocks and shares (not investment advice). The optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of automatic cars, driven by the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, presents a dilemma for new drivers: whether to learn in an automatic or manual car. While automatic tests are perceived as easier, the pass rate is actually higher for manual tests. Some learners face limited access to automatic instructors or find manual lessons cheaper. For people with disabilities, automatic cars can be more accessible, though a stigma persists around automatic-only licenses. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Counting is underway in the Irish presidential election, where voters chose between two candidates: Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, after Jim Gavin withdrew too late to have his name removed. Connolly is an independent politician backed by left-wing parties, while Humphreys is the Fine Gael candidate with senior cabinet experience.
