          <p>The Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand hosted a massive first birthday celebration for Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo who has become an international social media star. Thousands of fans, some traveling from as far as the United States, attended the event to see the beloved animal. The zoo organized special activities and auctions to raise funds for animal care, highlighting Moo Deng's role in promoting wildlife conservation. Pygmy hippos are an endangered species, with only a few thousand remaining in the wild, making such conservation efforts critically important.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the end of the mandatory shoe removal policy at U.S. airport security checkpoints, a rule in place for over two decades. The requirement was instituted after the 2001 attempted shoe-bombing by Richard Reid. The article characterizes the original policy as "security theater" and its removal as "populism theater," noting that the change aligns the experience of all travelers with that of those in premium programs like TSA PreCheck. The official justification cited multi-layered screening and new technology, though the article suggests the change is more a policy spectacle than a security evolution.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, a significant event coinciding with the company's market capitalization surpassing an unprecedented $4 trillion. While the meeting's agenda is not public, it likely involves discussions on the administration's stringent export controls on AI chips, which have impacted Nvidia's access to the Chinese market. The administration previously blocked sales of Nvidia's H20 processor to China and is developing new restrictions on AI technology exports. This high-level discussion highlights the critical intersection of the technology sector with national security and international trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denim manufacturer Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast of a decline. Despite this positive outlook, Levi's faces uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on goods from Southeast Asia, where much of its manufacturing is based. For now, the company plans to absorb the initial tariff costs, estimated at $25 million to $30 million, supported by strong consumer demand and a strategy of reduced promotions.
