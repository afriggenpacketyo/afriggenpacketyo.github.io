          <p>Eight oil-producing nations within the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase their collective crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August, a larger hike than anticipated. The decision is part of a broader strategy to unwind previous voluntary supply cuts. In a statement, the OPEC Secretariat cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the primary reasons for accelerating the production increase.</p>

          <p>Doctors are weighing in on the popular belief that drinking soda can alleviate migraines. Some experts note that caffeine, a key ingredient, can constrict blood vessels and disrupt nerve activity, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals. However, they also caution that caffeine can be a migraine trigger for others and that relying on sugary sodas is not a healthy long-term solution, suggesting alternatives like watermelon with salt for electrolytes.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers in China suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have the potential to combat cancer. The findings, published in the journal Nature, indicate that the drug can strengthen key anti-tumor immune cells known as dendritic cells. These cells, which act as intelligence agents for the immune system, can become depleted as a tumor progresses, and sildenafil appears to help reverse this process.</p>
