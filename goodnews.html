          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." This comment came after the Alaska summit where Trump and Vladimir Putin did not reach a formal ceasefire deal but discussed a path toward a peace agreement. Starmer emphasized that any resolution must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains steadfast. He also welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential deal.</p>

          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone stores to the High Street. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, all physical locations were closed, but the brand is now aiming to recapture its former popularity. The relaunch was marked by its first catwalk show in seven years during London Fashion Week, signaling a renewed focus on its trademark "London girl" aesthetic. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract former customers, the brand faces challenges in appealing to a new generation of shoppers and competing in a crowded market.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Vladimir Putin. The letter is said to raise concerns over the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and forcibly transferred to Russia during the war. This issue is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for his alleged role. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's efforts, highlighting it as a humane gesture amid complex diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes achieved multiple record closes this week, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July inflation report.

However, momentum slowed later in the week after wholesale inflation figures came in higher than anticipated. Despite some volatility, Wall Street's performance was strong, with several major companies like Nvidia, Meta, and Goldman Sachs hitting all-time highs during the week. (not investment advice)</p>

The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022 but reportedly decided on a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind difficult memories and establish a long-term family home. The couple will fund the move privately and will not have live-in staff, continuing their focus on maintaining a private family life.</p>

The project aims to provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to the affordable housing crisis by utilizing existing materials. The company's founder, Brian Stark, is now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex from shipping containers specifically for low-income senior citizens.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol hoisted him to safety; he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to expedite its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States. This technology involves placing large solar power stations in orbit to collect solar energy, convert it to electricity, and transmit it back to Earth using microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar, space stations can generate power continuously without being affected by weather or nighttime. The academic argued for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current reliance on smaller, less coordinated research efforts and close the technological gap.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article advocates for "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing safety and clarity without controlling every aspect of their lives. While the instinct to solve a child's problems and prevent suffering is strong, constant intervention can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The lighthouse metaphor suggests being a stable presence, ready to illuminate the way when needed but also allowing children to navigate their own journeys.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized a £180,000 deposit that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A London court granted a forfeiture order after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, which the Tate brothers did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million in other funds forfeited by the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. The confiscated money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs in the local community.</p>
