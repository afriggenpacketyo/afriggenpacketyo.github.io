          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, has died at the age of 89, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Nagashima was renowned for his stellar performances during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly as a key player for the Yomiuri Giants. His partnership with teammate Sadaharu Oh, known as "O-N," made them household names, fondly remembered by many older Japanese citizens as symbols of that era. Nagashima's charisma extended beyond sports, making him a cultural icon in Japan.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two divers who were convicted of theft for releasing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline off the Florida coast. The divers, who believed the line was illegal, were found guilty in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions restricted their voting rights, firearm ownership, and international travel. The pardons erase the convictions, with attorneys for the divers asserting the case should never have been filed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily suspending its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This policy reversal provides relief to older borrowers who are in default and rely on Social Security for income. The federal government has broad powers to collect on student loans, including seizing tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, with potential reductions of up to 15% for Social Security recipients. The pause allows borrowers more time to become current on their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks.</p>

The intention is to explore how different songs calm fussy babies and bring smiles to their faces, with potential for submissions to be featured on Morning Edition.</p>
