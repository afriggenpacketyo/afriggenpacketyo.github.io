        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed surprising growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which rose to 50.4. This figure contrasts with the official government PMI that indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, though the surveys use different sample sizes and methodologies. The Caixin rebound was largely driven by a rise in export orders, potentially due to companies front-loading shipments to avoid upcoming U.S. tariffs. This suggests resilience in some sectors of the Chinese economy despite ongoing trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law significant housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by easing environmental regulations. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process, a move long sought by developers but opposed by some labor and environmental groups. Newsom forced the legislation through by linking it to the state budget, a tactic he defended as necessary to overcome years of political gridlock on the issue and address the state's severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms after "caving" to pressure from President Donald Trump. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the 3% tax, which would have affected companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Canadian officials framed the move as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed, marking a de-escalation in the recent trade dispute.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed shifting 200 of the 4,000 California National Guard members currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The deployment to L.A., ordered by President Trump over the governor's objections to handle protests, has been controversial and legally challenged. State officials had previously warned that the move could hamper firefighting efforts by depleting resources, and the potential reassignment comes as California anticipates an early and active fire season this year.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and aging in multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of exercise and could inform future anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of physical activity. The study was a joint effort by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
