        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poundland, the budget retail chain, has been sold for ¬£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers by its owner, Polish firm Pepco, following struggles to compete with other discount stores and declining sales. The sale is part of a proposed restructure that could lead to the closure of up to 100 of its 825 UK stores. Despite the challenges, Pepco maintains that Poundland remains a popular brand with millions of customers annually. Barry Williams will continue to lead the business, which will operate under the Poundland brand in the UK and the Dealz brand in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland. The transaction aims to offload an unprofitable part of Pepco's business amid an increasingly challenging UK retail landscape.</p>

          <p>Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has reiterated his stance against violence, following his criticism of "anarchy" in Los Angeles, by releasing a "DO" and "DO NOT" list on social media. The list encourages peaceful protest and organizing to win elections, while condemning looting, arson, and assaulting law enforcement. Fetterman's message has garnered support from both sides of the aisle, with Republican Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA) expressing agreement with his colleague's sentiments. This follows Fetterman's earlier statement emphasizing the importance of condemning violence and destruction, even amidst support for free speech and peaceful demonstrations. His stance is seen by some as a move to reclaim the moral high ground for his party.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson at age 82, numerous musicians, including Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John, and Bob Dylan, have paid tribute to his musical genius. McCartney hailed Wilson's "mysterious sense of musical genius" and his ability to create simple yet brilliant songs. Wilson's innovative use of the recording studio, especially on the album *Pet Sounds*, cemented his reputation as a music pioneer, influencing countless artists. Fellow band member Al Jardine remembered Wilson as a humble musical giant who taught the world how to smile, while Dylan reflected on years of admiration for Wilson's genius.</p>

          <p>China plans to remove tariffs on nearly all goods from Africa, excluding eSwatini, as part of its trade policy. The announcement was made at a meeting in central China affiliated with the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Representatives from China and African nations criticized the United States for disrupting the global economic and trade order and harming international interests. President Xi Jinping stated that China would extend zero-tariff measures to 53 African countries with diplomatic ties to China, providing more convenience for least developed countries in Africa to export to China.</p>

          <p>Meta is suing Joy Timeline HK Limited, the developer of the CrushAI app, which creates non-consensual, sexualized images of others using AI technology. The Hong Kong-based company ran ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote CrushAI, prompting Meta to file the lawsuit in Hong Kong to stop them from continuing to advertise on its services. Meta has made multiple attempts to remove the ads, and is updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify these types of ads and remove copycat ads more quickly. Meta is also working with external experts and in-house specialist teams to keep up with how nudify app makers evolve their tactics to avoid detection, and will be sharing signals about these apps with other tech companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of restaurateurs is embracing a more modest model, focusing on local, independent operations rather than nationwide expansion. These owner-operators prioritize direct connections with customers, employees, and suppliers, seeking gratification in their communities. Examples include Caf√© Telegramma, √àtra, Jyan Isaac Bread, Ghisallo, and De La Nonna, which are improving their odds by avoiding high-rent spaces and running multiple operations from shared locations. While challenges such as industry shifts, economic downturns, and recent ICE activity persist, these small businesses are adapting by downsizing, partnering, and selling wholesale, demonstrating resilience and a commitment to community.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson's unreleased rap song, "Smart Girls," was intended to be a centerpiece of his Sire Records album "Sweet Insanity," but became a reason for the album's shelving. The song, produced by Matt Dike, aimed to uplift women in contrast to the negative portrayals in many rap songs at the time. Despite Wilson's initial enthusiasm, the album was rejected by Sire, and "Smart Girls" remained unreleased, circulating among fans through bootlegs. The song reflects Wilson's openness to experimentation and his willingness to collaborate with hip-hop producers, even if the results were unconventional.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning jazz drummer Terri Lyne Carrington is paying tribute to Max Roach with her album "We Insist 2025!", revisiting his 1961 album "We Insist!". The project is more than a musical tribute, reflecting on issues of inequality and racism that Roach fought against, which remain prevalent today. Carrington has called on the younger generation to help share her vision, including vocalist Christie Dashiell and trombonist Julian Priester, who appeared on Roach's original work. She hopes the record will introduce new fans to Roach‚Äôs legacy and revive the soul of protest music, with plans to collaborate with Roach's son on future shows.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that if the U.S. continues to impose AI semiconductor restrictions on China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the world's second-largest economy. While acknowledging that Nvidia's technology is a generation ahead, Huang emphasized the importance of maintaining access to the Chinese market to ensure the American technology stack remains competitive. He said that restricting U.S. participation in China would allow Huawei to dominate the market and potentially undermine the long-term competitiveness of American AI technology. He also expressed trust in President Trump's understanding of the industry dynamics and his ability to navigate the situation.</p>
