          <p>Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, an idea he believes would save money and encourage a long-term management focus. He posted on Truth Social that the change, subject to SEC approval, would better align U.S. corporate strategy with the long-term views seen in countries like China. However, the article notes that Chinese companies actually have stringent reporting requirements, including quarterly filings, and that Trump's proposal is more similar to practices in the UK and European Union. The idea of reducing short-term reporting pressures has been previously discussed by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple homes were destroyed by rare tornadoes that touched down in southeastern Utah, an area where such weather events are highly unusual. The Navajo Police Department confirmed three homes were demolished, though thankfully no human injuries have been reported. However, an unknown number of livestock and pets are missing, causing distress to local residents on the Navajo Nation reservation. The National Weather Service is investigating the storm, which produced at least two tornadoes, and noted that only two had been confirmed in that specific region since 1950. A survey team may be sent to assess the exact tracks and wind speeds of the tornadoes.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant increase in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his purchase of over 2.5 million shares, valued at approximately $1 billion. This move is widely interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from Musk in the company's future trajectory, especially amidst recent sales slumps and increasing competition. The purchase comes as shareholders consider a new pay package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire if Tesla meets highly ambitious performance targets over the next decade. The company has faced headwinds this year, partly attributed to blowback from Musk's political activities and affiliations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze, a 74-year-old award-winning poet and translator, as the new U.S. Poet Laureate for a one-year term. Sze, known for his collections that blend influences from ancient Chinese poetry with American landscapes, succeeds Ada Limón. His appointment comes during a period of turmoil for the Library of Congress following the firing of its head, Carla Hayden, by the Trump administration. Sze plans to use his platform to focus on translation as a way to deepen the public's appreciation for poetry, drawing from his own experience of learning his craft through translating Chinese works.</p>

          <h2>Report Highlights Potential for Critical Minerals to Boost African Economies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 08:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A data analysis reveals that Africa's vast reserves of critical minerals, such as cobalt, platinum, and manganese, could significantly boost the continent's economy, potentially increasing sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over 25 years. These minerals are essential for green technologies like electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy infrastructure, and global demand is surging. However, the article warns that this potential is threatened by challenges such as fragile governance, environmental damage from extraction, and inequitable revenue sharing. Currently, African nations are estimated to be generating only about 40% of the potential revenue, with much of the raw material being exported to China for refining.</p>

          <p>Market research indicates that fast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to "food-forward" convenience stores, which saw a 9% rise in morning traffic compared to just 1% for fast-food chains. Chains like Wawa and Casey's General Store are successfully competing by expanding their fresh food offerings, from made-to-order sandwiches to breakfast pizzas. This trend is driven by consumers seeking value and variety, as convenience stores can offer a wider range of items beyond a typical fast-food menu. Even major fast-food players like McDonald's have acknowledged that breakfast is their weakest and most economically sensitive daypart, as stressed consumers often opt to eat at home or find cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign a significant agreement to accelerate the development of nuclear power during President Donald Trump's state visit. The "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy" aims to streamline regulatory approval for new nuclear projects in both countries, potentially unlocking billions in private investment and creating thousands of jobs. One key deal involves U.S. firm X-Energy and UK's Centrica building up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. While the governments champion the move for energy security and economic growth, some environmental groups like Greenpeace criticize the focus on nuclear power, citing spiraling costs and construction delays.</p>

          <p>A new report from TransUnion shows an increasing number of renters are utilizing services that report their monthly rent payments to credit bureaus, helping them build or improve their credit scores. This practice is particularly beneficial for those with limited or no credit history, as including on-time rent payments can lead to an average credit score increase of 60 points. The trend is most popular among younger generations, with 18% of Gen Z renters reporting their payments. Experts advise consumers to research these services carefully, as some may charge fees or report late payments, which could negatively impact a person's score. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China, already the world leader in energy storage, has unveiled an action plan to almost double its capacity to over 180 gigawatts by 2027. The plan, released by the country's top economic and energy agencies, involves an estimated investment of 250 billion yuan (US$35 billion). This expansion will primarily focus on lithium-ion battery systems but also aims to develop alternative technologies like hydrogen and compressed-air storage. The initiative is deemed essential for stabilizing the power grid as China rapidly grows its renewable energy sector to meet its carbon neutrality goals, and it comes amid surging global demand for energy storage solutions.</p>

          <p>A program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids provides every pregnant resident with $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for their infant's first year, with no strings attached. New research on the program, the first of its kind to be implemented community-wide in the U.S., shows significant positive results. Participants experienced lower rates of postpartum depression and housing instability, while their infants had better health outcomes, leading to fewer NICU admissions and saving the city millions in healthcare costs. Born from the advocacy that followed the Flint water crisis, the program aims to prescribe away poverty and is gaining bipartisan interest as a model for other communities.</p>
