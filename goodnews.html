          <h2>UK to Extend Bereavement Leave to Parents Experiencing Miscarriage at Any Stage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 05:28:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The move, praised by campaigners, aims to formally recognize early-stage pregnancy loss as a bereavement and help reduce the stigma surrounding the topic.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Morning Workouts May Aid Weight Loss When Paired with Adequate Sleep</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and fitness experts suggest that exercising in the morning can be effective for weight loss, but only if it does not compromise sleep. Research indicates that individuals who consistently work out between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. tend to have lower BMIs and waist sizes. However, experts emphasize that getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep is crucial for muscle repair, growth, and overall health. If an early workout schedule leads to sleep deprivation, it can stall progress, making it more beneficial to prioritize rest over exercise in such cases.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from Lurgan, Northern Ireland, has set a new record as the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo. He completed the grueling 46km swim from the Gobbins in Northern Ireland to Portpatrick, Scotland, in 16 hours and 38 minutes. During the journey, Black battled strong currents that stalled his progress for hours and endured numerous jellyfish stings across his body. He described the swim as more of a mental than a physical challenge but felt the accomplishment was ultimately worth the hardship.</p>

          <p>In contrast to a national trend toward tougher enforcement, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction to tackle its homeless and addiction crises. The new Skid Row Care Campus provides a range of services, from housing and addiction treatment to clean syringes and fentanyl test strips for those not ready to quit using drugs. This approach aims to prevent overdose deaths, reduce the spread of disease, and build trust to eventually guide individuals toward recovery. While controversial, advocates argue it is a pragmatic and evidence-based strategy to save lives and improve public health among a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, an unknown number of "orphan" oil and gas wells, potentially numbering over a million, pose a significant environmental threat. These unplugged wells, relics of past and recent drilling, can leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other toxins into the air and water. A multi-billion dollar federal effort is now underway to address the problem, with the first step being the difficult task of locating these often-undocumented sites. The process is complicated by unclear ownership, as unprofitable wells are often sold between companies until one goes bankrupt, leaving cleanup costs to taxpayers.</p>

Scientists use its contained ecosystems, including a rainforest, ocean, and desert, to conduct cutting-edge research on climate change.

          <p>The popular claim that seed oils like canola and soybean are toxic is being challenged by many nutrition and health researchers. Critics, including public figures, argue these oils drive obesity and inflammation, but scientists say these assertions are often based on misinterpretations. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can be converted to pro-inflammatory compounds, human studies have not shown that consuming them increases inflammation markers. Experts agree that the main issue is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, which happen to contain seed oils, rather than the oils themselves being inherently harmful.</p>

          <p>A new wave of youth-led protests in Kenya is drawing parallels to the historic "Saba Saba" (Seven Seven) demonstrations of the 1990s, which pushed the country toward multi-party democracy. Analysts note that both movements were driven by a demand for better leadership and an end to corruption and state abuse. While the current Gen Z-led protests are more technologically savvy and lack singular political leaders, they face similar challenges, including a forceful government response. The enduring legacy of Saba Saba is seen in the continued belief that ordinary Kenyans have the power to demand political accountability.</p>

To maintain momentum, Danish leaders are framing the green transition as essential for Europe's strategic autonomy and defense, arguing that reducing fossil fuel dependency strengthens security.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The difference in taste between American and European chocolate stems from distinct production methods, regulations, and consumer preferences. U.S. chocolate, like Hershey's, often contains butyric acid for a longer shelf life, which imparts a tangy flavor that can be unfamiliar to European palates. In contrast, EU regulations mandate higher cocoa solid content and the use of cocoa butter, while traditional processes like conching create a smoother texture. These differences reflect a divergence in culinary history, with Europe prioritizing traditional, fine flavors and the U.S. favoring sweetness and durability.</p>
