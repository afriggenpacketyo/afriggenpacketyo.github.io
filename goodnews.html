          <p>Starbucks has launched new protein-enhanced lattes and cold foam, aligning with the growing trend of increased protein consumption. Registered dietitians acknowledge the potential benefits for individuals who often skip breakfast, as the added protein can promote feelings of fullness. However, experts caution that these beverages should not be considered meal replacements, as they lack essential nutrients like fiber and can contain significant amounts of sugar. They emphasize a food-first approach, recommending lean meats, eggs, and plant-based sources for a more balanced nutritional intake.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to begin processing new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has been closed to first-time applicants for four years due to legal challenges. A Justice Department proposal would reopen the program in all states except Texas, where a lawsuit is ongoing. Under the proposal, current DACA recipients in Texas could maintain deportation protection but would lose their work permits, creating uncertainty for the state's large DACA population. Advocacy groups are clarifying that applications will not start immediately, as the proposal awaits a final decision from a federal judge.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer aimed at reducing U.S. drug prices, under which the company will sell many medications to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. As part of the deal, Pfizer will be exempt from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs for three years in exchange for investing $70 billion in domestic manufacturing and research. The company will also offer significant discounts on popular drugs through a new government website, TrumpRx.gov. The White House is reportedly in similar negotiations with other drugmakers, using the threat of tariffs as leverage to secure lower prices for American consumers.</p>

          <p>A group of former inmates is volunteering to renovate the historic Tremont Temple Baptist Church in Boston, America's first integrated church. One volunteer, who was recently released after serving 21 years in prison, says the restoration work has provided him with a new sense of purpose and a way to contribute positively to the community. The project involves painstakingly reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs that date back to the 1890s. The pastor and volunteers see the renovation as a symbol of personal transformation and second chances, hoping to make the sanctuary a welcoming space for all once again.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that top officials violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. In a 161-page decision, Judge William Young stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio misused their powers to chill constitutionally protected speech. The judge condemned the administration's actions as an effort to terrorize non-citizen activists into silence. He also criticized the use of masked ICE agents for detentions, calling it a tactic to intimidate Americans.</p>

A trustworthy debt settlement program will have professional accreditation, such as from the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators, and a good standing with the Better Business Bureau. Legitimate companies will not charge upfront fees before a debt is settled and will be transparent about their fee structure. They will also provide honest communication about the risks involved, including potential damage to your credit score and a realistic timeline of two to four years.</p>

          <p>While Warren Buffett famously advises most people to invest in low-cost S&P 500 index funds, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests a different approach. Cramer agrees that index funds should form the core of a portfolio but argues that investors should also dedicate a portion to a handful of carefully researched individual stocks. He contends that settling for average market returns is unnecessary and that diligent individuals can achieve superior results by picking winning companies, citing Berkshire Hathaway's own stock performance as an example. Buffett's advice is aimed at "know-nothing investors," but Cramer believes anyone can develop the savvy to beat the market.</p>

For an $80,000 HELOC, the monthly payment is now approximately $966 for a 10-year term and $759 for a 15-year term, based on current average rates. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly cheaper than a year ago. The article notes that HELOCs feature variable rates, which means payments could decrease further with future Fed cuts, but also advises borrowers to calculate costs against various rate scenarios to ensure long-term affordability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt is often misunderstood but has significant implications for consumers. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative information, such as unpaid debts and late payments, must be removed from a credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. Separately, each state has a statute of limitations, often around seven years, which limits the time a creditor can sue to collect a debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact you. Making a payment on old debt can sometimes restart the statute of limitations, so understanding these distinctions is crucial for managing long-term debt.</p>
