          <h2>Analysts Suggest China Can Counter U.S. Tech Curbs by Partnering with Global South on AI</h2>

          <p>According to policy analysts, China has an opportunity to mitigate the effects of U.S. technology restrictions by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South. This strategy would involve promoting collaborative creation, equitable technology sharing, and the co-development of ethical AI frameworks that address diverse regional needs. By building inclusive AI infrastructure and ensuring fair data access, China could offer a compelling alternative to the U.S. strategy of supply chain decoupling. This approach aims to move beyond the direct rivalry with the U.S. and build new technological partnerships.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Most U.S. Teens Use AI for Social Interaction, But Prefer Human Connection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of American teenagers have used AI companions for activities like flirting, seeking advice, and general conversation. While over half use these tools regularly, the vast majority still prioritize and find more satisfaction in human friendships. The research raises concerns about privacy, as a quarter of teens have shared personal data, and the potential impact on social development during adolescence. Citing these risks, the nonprofit recommends that individuals under 18 should avoid using AI companions altogether.</p>

          <h2>Expert Discusses Challenges and Potential Solutions to America's Two-Party System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the widespread dissatisfaction with the American two-party system, highlighted by Elon Musk's proposal for a new political party. Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, explains that the current single-winner electoral system inherently marginalizes third parties, making them "spoilers" or "wasted votes." He argues that this structure has created a zero-sum political environment that is damaging American democracy. As a solution, Drutman advocates for proportional representation through multi-member districts, which he believes would make every vote more meaningful and reduce political polarization.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges into Waterways by 2030</h2>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." The government acknowledges the water sector is "broken" and plans tougher measures for non-compliant water company bosses, including potential prison sentences. This new target follows public outrage over record pollution levels and executive bonuses. While the plan aims to address a critical environmental issue, it rules out nationalization due to cost and will rely on a record £104 billion investment, likely leading to higher consumer water bills.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first-ever joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and economic cooperation between the two nations. The drill, themed around "joint border patrol training," will take place in China's Guangxi region, which borders Vietnam. This development occurs as the countries mark 75 years of diplomatic relations and navigate the challenges of the U.S. tariff war. The closer ties are also reflected on the economic front, where China remains Vietnam's largest trading partner and a key supplier for its manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in northern Italy last year, has been successfully moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which prevented the bear from being euthanized as originally ordered by provincial authorities. The bear, also called Gaia, arrived safely and is now housed in a specially designed, secure enclosure. The case has been at the center of a debate over managing human-wildlife conflict as the bear population in the region has grown.</p>

          <p>A rare fossil of a Sinopterus pterosaur discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this type of flying reptile. Researchers found microscopic plant mineral deposits, known as phytoliths, inside the creature's stomach. The fossil also contained small quartz crystals, which were likely swallowed as "stomach stones" to help grind and digest tough plant matter, a practice seen in many modern birds and lizards. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and renews a debate among paleontologists, providing strong evidence that this particular species of pterosaur was herbivorous.</p>

          <p>A contributor reflects on the societal pressures and "mom guilt" surrounding summer plans for children, arguing that the public discourse often misses the point. Whether children attend expensive camps or have an unscheduled "wild" summer is frequently dictated by financial necessity rather than parenting philosophy. The author, a teacher, notes that forgoing camp was a financial decision, just as sending kids to camp is a necessity for other working parents. The article suggests that the real issue is a societal structure that fails to support modern families, leaving mothers, in particular, to manage an immense mental load.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the earliest stages of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,370 light-years away. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's protoplanetary disk. This process, occurring in a region analogous to our solar system's asteroid belt, provides an unprecedented look at the building blocks of planets like Earth. The discovery suggests that the mechanisms that formed our own planet could be a common process throughout the universe.</p>

Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to overcome barriers to the Chinese market to establish a more balanced trade relationship.

The car, now housed at the National Motor Museum, will be started up on the beach in a ceremony attended by Campbell's grandson, Don Wales.
