          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million, resolving claims that the network broadcasted false information about election fraud in 2020. The payment is scheduled in three installments through early 2027. This settlement follows Dominion's landmark $787 million agreement with Fox News for similar claims. While Dominion expressed satisfaction with the resolution, Newsmax defended its coverage as fair but stated its decision to settle was influenced by a belief that it would not receive a fair trial.</p>

          <p>With rising retirement costs, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity without selling their property. Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out such a loan is often in the late 60s to early 70s, as older borrowers typically qualify for larger amounts. Key factors to consider include immediate income needs, long-term financial goals, health status, and plans to age in place, as the loan becomes due upon moving out or death.

          <p>New research indicates that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is significantly impacting contraceptive use in the U.S. A study published in JAMA Network Open found that 31.8% of people who obtained the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception at all. The findings suggest the prescription-free option is successfully reducing barriers to access, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals who cited the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment as a primary reason for their choice.</p>

The Texas Department of State Health Services credited a comprehensive response involving vaccination, testing, and public education, while warning that vigilance is still needed due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The California Area School District in Pennsylvania is making music education more accessible by 3D printing violins for its students. Superintendent Dr. Laura Jacob initiated the program to overcome the high cost of renting instruments, which can be a barrier for the district's many low-income families. By producing the violins for about $50 each, the school can offer them for free, fostering confidence and a love for music in students who might otherwise not have the opportunity to learn an instrument.</p>

          <p>An analyst from Evercore ISI has issued a short-term negative tactical call on cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, citing subdued channel checks and the stock's high valuation ahead of its upcoming earnings report. Meanwhile, investors are also focused on competitor Palo Alto Networks, which is set to release its results, with hopes it will buck a trend of mixed earnings within the sector. The market is particularly watching for signs that Palo Alto's core business remains strong following its major acquisition of CyberArk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The two-stage plan reportedly involves a 60-day temporary truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, negotiations would proceed toward a permanent ceasefire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. There has been no immediate official comment from Israel on the development, which comes as its military plans to expand its offensive.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is changing its name to MS NOW (My Source News Opinion World) and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring where MSNBC, along with CNBC and other entertainment networks, will be spun off from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal into a new entity called Versant. The change marks a new chapter for the network, founded nearly 30 years ago as a partnership between Microsoft and NBC, as it aims to establish a separate and independent identity.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower drug costs, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, to cash-paying U.S. patients for $499 a month.

The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, aiming to increase access for uninsured patients and compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions of the drug, thereby making the treatment more accessible.</p>

This innovative model aims to overcome the high costs of nuclear construction by having Google and Kairos assume the financial risk, while TVA provides a revenue stream through a power purchase agreement, accelerating clean energy deployment.</p>
