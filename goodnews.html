        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is engaged in a renewed debate regarding the potential ban of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, following its classification as a "confirmed right-wing extremist" organization by the country's domestic intelligence agency. This classification has already led to political repercussions, including barring AfD politicians from accompanying government officials on international trips. The AfD has filed a lawsuit against the intelligence agency, claiming the classification is unlawful and an attempt to criminalize criticism of immigration policy. The security authority's report is largely based on court rulings by the independent judiciary, which have provided extensive evidence of just how radical the AfD is.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional and legal requirements for 'due process' for non-citizens facing deportation under the Trump administration. While the Constitution guarantees due process to all individuals on U.S. soil, the specifics of what that entails for migrants are contested. Legal experts explain that due process does not necessarily mean a trial for every migrant, but requires the government to take steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals. The article outlines various legal precedents and ongoing legal challenges, highlighting the complexities of balancing immigration enforcement with constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at easing exports for UK firms and reducing taxes on Indian goods. The deal, which does not alter immigration policies, is projected to increase trade between the two countries by an additional ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040. Key benefits include halved tariffs on gin and whisky, reduced levies on cars and food products, and a three-year exemption on social security for Indian employees working in the UK. The agreement is considered the UK's most significant bilateral trade deal since leaving the European Union.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released footage demonstrating the electromagnetic catapult system on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The footage provides a glimpse of an aircraft launching from the carrier's deck.

The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian's carrier-based aircraft will take off with full fuel and full ordnance.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo, women divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, may have developed unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep diving. Research indicates they possess lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance, potentially leading to future medical treatments. Genomic analysis revealed at least three distinctive traits: bradycardia, a slow heart rate, and genetic mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure. These adaptations may protect pregnant women while diving, resisting the rise in blood pressure typically associated with breath-holding.</p>
