          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on trading partners. The agreement, eyed since Trump's first term, aims for closer economic cooperation. Details are unclear but may involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. tech companies. This agreement would be a significant win for both countries, potentially offsetting weaker relations with Europe for Britain and fulfilling Trump's desire for quick trade deals. However, some experts suggest it might be a limited agreement requiring further negotiation.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, has revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly U.S.-China trade tariffs. Despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, Maersk warned that current tariff levels could restrict global container market volumes. The company now projects container volume growth between -1% and 4%, down from the previous forecast of 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the issue is primarily a China-U.S. one and hasn't yet affected other trade lanes.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. The forecast comes after Nintendo reported a decline in fourth-quarter revenue and profit, which was expected as consumers await the new console. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and offer improved features. However, Nintendo delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where its consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson is exploring the potential for increased use of electronic tagging as an alternative to imprisonment. The government will meet with technology companies to discuss how technology can help monitor offenders more effectively. Timpson emphasizes his focus on rehabilitating offenders to reduce re-offending rates, and is known for hiring ex-offenders. He acknowledges the prison system is in a state of "crisis" due to overcrowding, and the government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong following a threat of legal action by the Indian government. The sale of the Piprahwa Gems, described as a significant archaeological find, drew criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders. India argued that the relics are an inalienable part of India's and the global Buddhist community's heritage, and their sale would violate Indian and international laws. Sotheby's stated that the suspension would allow for discussions between the parties involved.</p>
