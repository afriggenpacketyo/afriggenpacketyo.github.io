          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:27:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, specifically in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes. While there have been no cases of West Nile virus acquired within the UK to date, this discovery is not unexpected, as the virus is widespread in Europe. Experts emphasize the risk to the general public remains very low, but this detection is part of a wider changing landscape, where, in the wake of climate change mosquito-borne diseases are expanding to new areas. Public health officials recommend eliminating standing water sources and using mosquito repellent to minimize potential risks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:20:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed for camping. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public access to the commons for open-air recreation, naturally including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception allowing wild camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight and relief, emphasizing the need for responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>

Achieving these goals requires addressing challenges such as wage stagnation, affordable housing shortages, and potential federal budget cuts.

Those on the left of the party in particular have been arguing that cuts to some departments could be averted if Reeves introduced a wealth tax or relaxed her rules on borrowing and debt.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday unveiled the latest RAV4 to be rolled out in Japan, North America and Europe in the current fiscal year through March, with the revamped model of the compact sport utility vehicle to be the first to incorporate its new software system. The Arene system was used to develop software powering the new multimedia system's cockpit voice agent and center display, as well as advanced safety technologies, Toyota said. Like smartphones, software-defined vehicles can receive updates that add new features or enhance existing ones, allowing customers to upgrade their cars without buying a new vehicle.</p>
