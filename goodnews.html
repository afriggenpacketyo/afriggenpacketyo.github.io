          <p>Bobby Sherman, the teen idol known for his shaggy mop top and hits like "Little Woman," died at 81 after battling Stage 4 cancer. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced his death, with family friend John Stamos sharing her message on social media. Sherman gained fame in the 1960s and '70s, appearing on the covers of magazines like Tiger Beat and Sixteen, and starring in TV shows like "Here Come the Brides." After his music career, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, donating his salary and later co-founding a children's foundation in Ghana. Sherman's life was full of purpose, both in the entertainment industry and in public service.</p>

          <p>The winning design for a memorial honoring Queen Elizabeth II in London features a bridge with a translucent balustrade resembling her wedding tiara. Foster + Partners' design for St. James Park also includes statues of the Queen and Prince Philip, along with gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and UK communities. Norman Foster described the bridge as symbolic of the Queen's role as a unifying force. The publicly funded memorial is expected to cost approximately $62 million, but its development has drawn criticism from some who believe the royal family should fund the project themselves.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings in the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. While FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling below expectations, the company's full-year fiscal 2026 guidance includes significant cost-cutting reductions. The company is also planning to spin out its Freight division, with the tax-free spin-off expected within 18 months.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an AI company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case regarding the use of copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude. A judge ruled that using legally purchased books for training was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate fair use doctrine. However, the court also found that Anthropic may have broken the law by downloading millions of pirated books, leading to a separate trial in December. The lawsuit was filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to "large-scale theft," but the company maintains that its training methods are transformative.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but the agreement was immediately tested. China has been closely monitoring developments in the war due to its significant crude oil imports from Iran, which are facilitated through a "dark fleet" of vessels to evade American sanctions. The situation underscores the complex geopolitical relationships and economic dependencies in the region. China's role as a major importer of Iranian oil adds another layer to the ongoing tensions.</p>
