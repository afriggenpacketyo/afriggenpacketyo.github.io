          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected major U.S. technology companies. This decision came after President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the proposed tax. Ottawa stated the move was made in anticipation of reaching a comprehensive trade agreement with the United States. The rescinded 3% levy was set to be collected starting Monday and would have applied retroactively to 2022 revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce More Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, contribute to this effect. Regenerative braking converts kinetic energy back into battery power when slowing down, creating low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. This issue presents a new challenge for automotive engineers focused on improving passenger comfort in the next generation of vehicles.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, has expressed concern that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 campaign due to fixture congestion and player exhaustion. While acknowledging the financial and prestigious benefits of the tournament, Guardiola noted the relentless schedule gives players minimal rest. He stated that while he understands the arguments for more rest, as a manager he must follow the rules set by FIFA and other governing bodies. Manchester City is set to face Al-Hilal in the tournament.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The decision to lift the ban follows an agreement between the two nations in May to begin procedures for resuming trade. While the ban is lifted, it may still take several months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of Japanese seafood to China can restart. (not investment advice)</p>
