          <h2>Federal Judge Issues Temporary Injunction Against Alleged Discriminatory Immigration Stops in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 21:37:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops in Southern California that are allegedly based on racial profiling. The ruling follows a lawsuit by immigrant rights groups, which presented substantial evidence of agents targeting individuals based on their appearance, language, or presence at locations like car washes and Home Depots. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that these practices likely violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The order also mandates that detainees be granted 24-hour access to legal counsel, marking a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>The song "The Night We Met" by indie band Lord Huron has become a massive sleeper hit a decade after its initial 2015 release. Originally an overlooked album track, its inclusion in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 initiated a slow burn of popularity, which has since been amplified by viral trends on TikTok. The wistful ballad has now surpassed three billion streams on Spotify, a milestone even Taylor Swift has not yet reached, and consistently outperforms contemporary hits on global charts. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes its enduring appeal to its relatable theme of lost love.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, the undocumented father of three U.S. Marines, is set to be released on a $3,000 bond after being held in federal custody for 20 days. His arrest gained national attention after a video showed masked federal agents violently tackling and beating him in Orange County. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and is married to a citizen, had applied for parole-in-place, a status available to relatives of military members. His family expressed relief at the judge's decision but remains concerned about the injuries he sustained during the arrest and plans to seek immediate medical care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically struggled on grass but has found her form, adjusting her baseline position to better utilize her powerful forehand. Anisimova, returning to top form after a mental health break, plays an aggressive, high-risk game that could thrive in an underdog role. With no prior tour-level meetings, the outcome will likely depend on who better manages the immense pressure of the occasion, making for an unpredictable and history-making championship match.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a new foreign policy course for his nation, emphasizing sovereignty and an "Australia first" doctrine amid rising global tensions. In a recent speech, he drew inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, who prioritized Australia's strategic reality over traditional alliances. This recalibration aims to balance relationships with key partners like the United States and rivals such as China. While maintaining foundational security pacts like AUKUS, Albanese's government appears determined to act in Australia's direct national interest, shaping its own future rather than being defined by the tug of war between global superpowers.</p>

For the first 14 years of his life, Viraj was unable to communicate effectively due to apraxia, leading many to believe he was severely mentally disabled. His single father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his thumb, unlocking a brilliant mind that had been trapped. In just three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus and now hopes his story will inspire a re-evaluation of the potential within the non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit young users for commercial gain. The state's attorney general argues these features are designed to maximize engagement, thereby increasing exposure to ads and driving purchases. In his ruling, the judge found the state's claims were specific enough and focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not its user-generated content, marking an important step in the state's effort to hold the company accountable.</p>

          <p>In a significant move amid the escalating AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key members of his team. This "talent acquisition" deal gives Google a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology but does not involve a direct investment in the company, which will continue to operate independently. The hiring follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. This action underscores the intense competition among tech giants to secure top-tier AI researchers and developers to advance their own platforms.</p>
