          <p>Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, has unexpectedly withdrawn from her scheduled appearance at Royal Ascot as she continues to balance her return to public engagements following cancer treatment. While she was originally listed on the carriage list, she is said to be disappointed to miss the event. Prince William attended with King Charles and Queen Camilla, while Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, was also present. This comes after Kate's recent appearances at Trooping the Colour and the Order of the Garter service, signaling her gradual return to royal duties after completing preventative chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>Faith leaders in Los Angeles are mobilizing to protest immigration raids and provide support to undocumented immigrants, citing their faith as a guiding force. After ICE agents raided a taco stand near his church and used the church parking lot, Pastor Kevin Kang rallied his congregation to declare the church grounds unwelcoming to ICE. Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice (Clue) has established a bail fund for detained immigrants and is organizing a 30-day rapid response plan. This activism echoes the sanctuary movement of the 1980s, where churches provided refuge to Central American refugees.</p>

          <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has withdrawn from a planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life after her cancer diagnosis last year. Royal sources say she is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements and was disappointed to miss the event. The King, Queen, and Prince William attended the event, and Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, was also present. The princess was last seen smiling and joking with other royals on Monday during the Order of the Garter service in Windsor.</p>

          <p>Premiership-winning flanker Ted Hill believes he may have been thrust into international rugby too soon, despite winning his first England cap in 2018 at age 19. Hill has only added three more caps in the seven years since, but after an outstanding season for Bath, he feels ready to make an impact for England. He will have an opportunity to prove himself as England plays France in a non-cap match ahead of their summer tour of Argentina and the USA. Hill recognizes the challenges of international rugby but is eager to excel at that level.</p>

A National Security Agreement with the U.S. government ensures the majority of U.S. Steel's board and key management personnel are U.S. citizens, and the company will issue a "golden share" to the U.S. government.</p>

This figure is a slight decrease from the previous week's 250,000 claims. However, the four-week average of claims rose to 245,500, the highest since August 2023. Economists suggest that the U.S. job market is decelerating after years of strong hiring, partly due to interest rate hikes and trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, exploring the reasons behind this perception and its potential impact on male loneliness. It challenges the notion that men don't gossip, citing research that shows men gossip at similar rates as women, but may lack the cultural opportunities and training to do so effectively. The article suggests that the fear of appearing "messy" or stirring the pot prevents men from fully engaging in gossip, which can be a valuable social tool for building intimacy and connection. Ultimately, the author poses the question of whether improving men's gossip skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic.</p>
