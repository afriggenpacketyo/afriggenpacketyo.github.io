As the city prepares to celebrate the 250th birthdays of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, the staff's connection to the community highlights the installation's significant, though often unseen, local presence and impact.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a new record high on Tuesday, exceeding $4,000 per ounce, continuing a significant upward trend driven by inflation and geopolitical instability. For potential investors who feel they missed the opportunity, the article suggests several affordable entry points into the market before prices potentially climb higher. These strategies include purchasing fractional gold bars and coins, employing a dollar-cost averaging approach to build a position over time, and exploring alternative investments like gold IRAs or ETFs. Experts predict prices could continue to rise into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings' undrafted rookie Myles Price has made an immediate impact as the team's primary kick and punt returner through the first five games of his NFL career. Price, who recently got his first passport for the team's trip to Europe, expresses confidence that he is on the verge of returning a kick for a touchdown every time he touches the ball. He detailed his preparation process, which involves studying opposing punters and focusing on tracking the ball in the air to ensure optimal positioning. Despite his success in college as a receiver, he is still seeking his first-ever return touchdown.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a reader identifying as an atheist expresses frustration with religious individuals who use platitudes like "God has a plan," feeling it presumes a shared belief system. The columnist, James Parker, who identifies as a believer, acknowledges that such phrases can be irritating, especially when suffering seems random and earthly powers arbitrary. However, he advises the reader to practice generosity, suggesting that these expressions are often just how people try to make sense of difficult moments and get through the day. He concludes that it's best to not be annoyed by these collisions of belief.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team narrowly avoided an upset in the Women's World Cup, securing a four-wicket victory over Bangladesh in a tense match. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batting lineup struggled against spin, collapsing to 103-6 at one point. Captain Heather Knight anchored the innings with a patient, unbeaten 79, guiding her team to victory with support from Charlie Dean. Earlier, England's spinners had dominated, with Sophie Ecclestone taking three wickets to help bowl Bangladesh out for 178. The unconvincing win highlights England's ongoing challenges against spin bowling despite maintaining their winning start to the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance, with estimated average payouts of around £700 per person. The scheme addresses unfair discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers were incentivized to charge higher interest rates, affecting an estimated 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The total compensation payout from lenders could reach £8.2 billion. The FCA is proposing a formal scheme to streamline the process, which will require lenders to contact affected customers and review their cases for potential redress.</p>

          <p>Jordi Alba, the acclaimed Spanish left-back, has announced he will retire from professional football at the conclusion of Inter Miami's current MLS season.

Alba joined Miami in 2023, reuniting with former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, the latter of whom also recently announced his retirement. A key member of dominant Barcelona and Spain teams, he was known for his attacking prowess, winning numerous titles including the Champions League.</p>

          <p>For borrowers facing debt collectors, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) provides several important rights to ensure fair treatment. These protections prohibit collectors from using harassment, threats, or deceptive tactics and limit when and how they can make contact. Consumers also have the right to demand written validation of the debt to verify its accuracy, and collectors must cease efforts until proof is provided. Furthermore, borrowers can control communication by sending a written request for the collector to stop contacting them, giving them space to assess their options without constant pressure.</p>

          <p>After 35 years, two Austrian women who were accidentally switched at birth have finally met. Doris Grünwald and Jessica Baumgartner were born prematurely at the same hospital in Graz in October 1990 and were given to the wrong parents. The discovery began when one of the women found her blood type did not match her parents' during a blood donation. After years of searching, the other woman was located after a doctor, aware of the case, noticed a similar blood type discrepancy during her pregnancy. The two women and their families have now connected, describing the experience as emotional but also a relief.</p>
