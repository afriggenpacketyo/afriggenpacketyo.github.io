          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of online real estate company Opendoor following a campaign from investors critical of the company's performance. The move comes after the stock price surged recently, driven by interest from retail investors and hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who had publicly called for her departure. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna will serve as interim leader while the company searches for a permanent replacement. Opendoor, which went public via a SPAC in 2020, has struggled with rising interest rates impacting its home-buying business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant revival, with recent successful debuts from companies like Bullish, Figma, and Circle. After a nearly three-year period of inactivity caused by inflation and high interest rates, investor confidence is returning, fueled by a rallying Nasdaq. Wall Street executives and venture capitalists are optimistic that the "IPO window is open," potentially clearing a backlog of highly-valued private companies waiting to go public. However, some analysts caution that the market may be overheating, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble and warning that the enthusiastic reception could be unsustainable.

          <p>A parenting book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man and returned by his child, who explained the family's history in an accompanying letter. The borrower was likely the man's grandmother, who moved to Mexico for work shortly after checking out the book. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, waiving what would have been an estimated fine of nearly $900.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to produce an affordable electric pickup truck by focusing on a simple, barebones base model. The two-seat Slate Truck is designed to be highly customizable, allowing owners to add features like an infotainment system or even convert it into an SUV using accessory kits. The company's main selling point is its low price, which was initially advertised as under $20,000 with federal tax credits. With those incentives being rolled back, the truck's competitiveness at a higher price point of around $28,000 is now in question.</p>

          <p>Shares of Salesforce rose after a securities filing revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has led to market speculation that another round of investor activism is imminent, which could pressure management to improve performance. Starboard was a key player in a successful 2023 activist campaign that pushed Salesforce to focus on profitability, leading to a significant stock price increase. The renewed interest comes as Salesforce's stock has struggled in 2025 amid concerns about its M&A strategy and the threat AI poses to its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the movement against Atlanta's police training center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment for two and a half years after the arrest. The ruling is a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO conspiracy indictments. Marsicano's attorney argued that the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as making "the process the punishment."</p>

          <p>The common spice cloves, used for centuries in traditional medicine, may offer several health benefits according to scientific research. Studies suggest that the antibacterial properties of cloves can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease. The active compound eugenol is also linked to the spice's ability to lower blood sugar levels, as seen in a 2019 study where participants taking clove extract showed improvement. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like calcium and potassium and act as a natural antioxidant, which can help prevent cell damage.</p>

          <h2>Horror Film 'Weapons' Explores Grief and Catharsis Through a Supernatural Mystery</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 14:27:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class and the community's struggle to understand the senseless tragedy. The movie follows the parallel investigations of a grieving father and a teacher, ultimately revealing a supernatural villain behind the events. The article praises the film for providing a conclusive and cathartic ending where the villain is defeated, a choice that satisfies the audience. However, it also notes that the film subverts this satisfaction by emphasizing that vanquishing the evil does not undo the trauma it caused, making it a "feel-bad, feel-good movie of the year."</p>
