          <p>Svetlana Dali was found guilty by a federal jury for stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris in November 2024. Dali passed through security using a crewmember lane and blended in with boarding passengers to bypass gate agents. During the trial, Dali admitted she did not have a boarding pass and stayed in the bathroom for most of the flight. After being caught in France and sent back to the U.S., Dali admitted to intentionally evading TSA and Delta employees to travel without a ticket, and later tried to cross into Canada after cutting off her ankle monitor. </p>

          <p>The White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released its first report identifying poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of activity, and overmedicalization as key drivers of childhood chronic diseases. The report echoes Kennedy's long-held views, including criticism of ultra-processed foods and the federal dietary guidelines. While some officials praised the report's frankness, others criticized it for misrepresenting facts and omitting well-known drivers of chronic disease, such as maternal health and preterm birth. The National Corn Growers Association expressed concern over the report's fear-based information about pesticides.</p>

Payday loans, known for their high-interest rates and quick repayment timelines, can quickly become unmanageable. While traditional debt consolidation programs may not always include payday loans, personal loans or payday loan-specific consolidation programs can be viable options. Before consolidating, it's crucial to consider the fees, terms, credit impact, and financial habits to ensure it's a beneficial step towards financial stability.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill to shift control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary, aiming to protect judges from political interference and ensure strong security protections. The move follows concerns that the White House or Justice Department might direct the Marshals to ignore court orders or withdraw security from judges. The legislation seeks to create a special board, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to oversee the Marshals.</p>

          <p>The public's understanding of WAGs is rapidly evolving to acknowledge their own social and economic power. They‚Äôve transformed from tabloid punching bags to an appealing status symbol. The current popularity of WAG influencers in Formula 1 can be credited to the former partners of a few young popular drivers from 2019 to 2022, like Carlos Sainz‚Äôs girlfriend Isa Hern√°ez and Charles Leclerc‚Äôs girlfriend Charlotte Sine, who were both featured on Drive to Survive. When we celebrate the influence of WAGs, we‚Äôre mostly talking about their ability to turn other women into consumers and spectators, not athletes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 12:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session and days of negotiations. The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward. All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a "reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam."</p>
