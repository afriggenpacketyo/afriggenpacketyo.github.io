          <p>During a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, President Trump announced his intention to visit China early next year. This planned visit comes amid an escalating trade war, with the President having recently threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by November if a deal is not reached. Despite the threat, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement, noting that China has been respectful and is paying significant amounts in tariffs. The President also confirmed he still plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Steve Borthwick, has expressed high praise for Leicester back row player Emeka Ilione, who has been included in a national team training camp. Borthwick highlighted the 23-year-old's power, versatility, and intelligence, particularly his ability to win turnovers with minimal penalties and carry the ball effectively in tight spaces. Ilione's inclusion comes as England shifts focus from Tom Willis, who is moving to a French club and will become ineligible for selection. The coach's comments signal a strategic investment in developing new talent for the national squad with an eye on the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced a policy change to no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to redirect officer resources toward matters that meet the criminal threshold. This decision was revealed as the Met dropped its investigation into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The Police Commissioner stated that officers should not be policing "toxic culture war debates," and the new policy is intended to reduce ambiguity. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the 'No Kings' demonstrations across the U.S. to protest the Trump administration, with the events characterized by a tone of jubilant contempt and irreverent humor rather than violence. Despite predictions from some Republican leaders of riots and chaos, the marches in major cities were overwhelmingly peaceful, with no arrests reported in New York. The article suggests that the protests may signify the emergence of a new political posture—a broad, left-liberal coalition united by shared opposition to the administration's agenda. This diverse coalition seeks to restore liberal-democratic norms that allow for constructive disagreement.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," centrally features decommissioned Confederate statues, including a massive monument of General Robert E. Lee that once stood in Charlottesville, Virginia. The statue has been melted down into bronze ingots, which are displayed alongside contemporary art pieces to reframe the narrative surrounding these controversial figures. The curator aims to confront the history of white supremacy that the monuments represent, contrasting with President Trump's calls to reinstall them. The exhibit transforms these symbols of a divisive past into a medium for new artistic and historical commentary.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that former Democratic congresswoman Katie Porter's campaign for California governor is not necessarily doomed by recent controversies, including a tense interview and a leaked video of her berating a staffer. While acknowledging that female candidates are often held to a higher behavioral standard, the author suggests voters may forgive her temperament if they align with her policy stances. The piece notes that Democrats currently favor fighters, and the incidents have raised Porter's name recognition in a previously quiet race. The author concludes that her reputation as a fierce advocate could ultimately outweigh concerns about her temper.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent European clinical trials have found that cannabis is more effective than both a placebo and opioids for treating chronic low back pain. One study showed a cannabis oil blend provided better pain relief and caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids over a six-month period. Another trial found the same cannabis tincture outperformed a placebo, although experts note the effect size was modest. These findings are considered significant due to the difficulty of conducting such large-scale cannabis research in the U.S., where it remains a Schedule 1 drug, and could influence future pain management practices.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges such as tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially expected for 2025. Industry sales and production have held up better than anticipated, supported by relatively stable consumer spending. While automakers have incurred billions in tariff-related costs, these have been partially offset by deregulation and corporate gains. However, headwinds persist, including stress in the subprime auto lending market and uncertainty surrounding EV adoption, creating a cautiously optimistic outlook as companies prepare to report third-quarter earnings.

This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries and addresses long-standing criticism from rights groups who argued that prescription requirements created barriers for women, particularly younger individuals and victims of sexual assault.
