          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that the artificial intelligence market is likely in an investment bubble, comparing the current investor overexcitement to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. While affirming his belief in AI's long-term importance, his comments add to a growing chorus of experts concerned that investment in the sector is moving too quickly and speculatively. Despite these concerns and OpenAI's unprofitability, the company is reportedly preparing a secondary stock sale that would value it at approximately $500 billion, indicating continued strong investor confidence.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "great resignation" has reportedly been replaced by the "great stay," a phenomenon consultants are calling "job hugging," where employees hold onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty. This trend is a reversal of the high job-hopping rates seen in 2021 and 2022, reflecting a cooled labor market where hiring and quit rates have fallen to multi-year lows. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging can lead to stagnated wage growth and skill development for workers, and may make it more difficult for new entrants, like recent graduates, to find employment.

          <p>A fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River in Minnesota discovered a submerged car, which authorities believe has solved the nearly 60-year-old cold case of Roy Benn. Benn was reported missing in September 1967 and was last seen driving his 1963 Buick Electra. Divers recovered the vehicle, which matched the description and VIN of Benn's car, and found human remains inside. Authorities have notified Benn's remaining family and believe the discovery will finally bring closure to the long-unsolved disappearance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite some public calls for Los Angeles to cancel its hosting of the 2028 Olympic Games, the city is bound by a legally airtight host city contract with the International Olympic Committee. The article explains that there is no provision for the city to unilaterally withdraw, and doing so would expose it to billions of dollars in lawsuits and damages. Unlike Denver's withdrawal from the 1976 Winter Games, the modern Olympics are a massive financial and logistical undertaking, making a last-minute relocation unfeasible. L.A.'s existing infrastructure and long preparation time further solidify its role as host.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of active short-term rental listings, such as those on Airbnb and VRBO, has decreased in Los Angeles over the past year. This decline is attributed to the city's increasingly strict Home-Sharing Ordinance, which includes new enforcement tools and the threat of significant fines for violations. Some property owners are reportedly removing their listings out of fear of penalties, while others are shifting to mid-term rentals (stays of 30 days or more) to avoid the regulations and the hassle of frequent tenant turnover, signaling a potential shift in the local rental market.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how jewelry serves as a powerful emblem of identity, reinvention, and connection to the past, centered on a watch inherited from her grandmother. She posits that accessories, more than clothing, define who we are because of their daily permanence, acting as personal talismans. The grandmother's watch, and her broader collection, represent a life of constant self-creation and performance, from adopting a Mid-Atlantic accent to pursuing ballet. The author sees these inherited pieces as a link to her grandmother's spirit and a guide in her own journey of self-discovery.</p>
