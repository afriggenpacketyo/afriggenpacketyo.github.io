        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian customs officials, in collaboration with the FSB security service, have intercepted their largest drug shipment from Latin America this year. Approximately 1,800 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, were discovered hidden within a cargo of bananas. The illicit drugs were packaged in briquettes disguised with a luxury brand's label and found with the help of service dogs. This seizure highlights a growing trend of drug traffickers using Russia as a transit hub, partly due to the ongoing war in Ukraine making other routes inaccessible.</p>

          <p>The United States has completed new naval facilities in Oyster Bay, Philippines, intended to enhance the maintenance and repair capabilities for the Philippine military's small watercraft. While the U.S. embassy has stated the site is not a military base, analysts believe it will significantly strengthen the Philippine Navy's ability to confront Chinese vessels in the contested South China Sea. The development is seen as a strategic move to bolster the Philippines' maritime defense and potentially pave the way for shared use of naval facilities between the two allies.</p>

          <p>For decades, Russ Miller, known as the "River Cowboy," has dedicated himself to cleaning up Kentucky's rivers, personally removing an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 discarded tires. Miller's grassroots efforts began in the 1980s and led to the formation of the cleanup group Friends of Red River, which tackles the pervasive issue of illegal tire dumping. The problem is widespread, with an estimated one million tires going unaccounted for in the state each year, often ending up in waterways and posing environmental hazards, but Miller's work inspires community action and hope for change.</p>

          <p>Gaming platform Roblox has launched a new age-verification system as part of its "trusted connections" feature, allowing users 13 and older to engage in less-filtered private chats.

The move comes as social media companies face increasing pressure to implement age-screening, and Roblox is also introducing new privacy tools for parents to monitor their teens' activity.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the unique and powerful seed dispersal method of the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber. When ripe, the fruit becomes pressurized with fluid and, upon the slightest touch, explodes, launching its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and distances of nearly 40 feet. Scientists used high-speed videography and CT scans to analyze the perfect ballistic angle and internal seed arrangement that enables this feat. The seeds also have a supremely sticky coating, which could inspire new bio-adhesives and materials.</p>
