          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss increased cooperation for freight rail efficiency. This clarification follows speculation that Berkshire might join a takeover fray after Union Pacific announced plans to buy Norfolk Southern. Buffett's comments led to a more than 4% drop in CSX shares and over 2% for Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, as the market reacted to the absence of a major acquisition. Instead, Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX announced a partnership to provide new coast-to-coast rail services, aiming for efficiency without an acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials announced a significant breakthrough with the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, identified as the "Rich Rollin’ Burglary Crew," accused of nearly 100 home and business break-ins across the city's Westside. Operating since 2022, this crew specifically targeted high-end valuables such as jewelry, designer purses, and firearms, converting them into cash. District Attorney Nathan Hochman emphasized that these were "crimes of greed," not born of necessity. Mayor Karen Bass lauded the operation as a "major win," highlighting how a vehicle pursuit in February led to arrests and a subsequent search warrant, which uncovered a cache of stolen credit cards, license plates, and weapons.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is set to introduce a new Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league, commencing in 2026, to acknowledge the evolving and increasingly vital role of relief pitchers in contemporary baseball. This new honor will become the fifth annual award bestowed by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, complementing existing accolades like the Most Valuable Player and Cy Young awards. The initiative addresses a perceived oversight, given that only one reliever has won a Cy Young since 1992, and none have finished in the top three for MVP voting. The award aims to provide proper recognition for the specialized and critical contributions of bullpen pitchers, moving beyond solely save statistics.</p>

Norrie held a commanding lead of 7-5, 6-4 when the 25-year-old American, who had only recently returned to tour action following a three-month shin stress fracture lay-off, made the decision to withdraw. Norrie, who had previously experienced losses in three of their four past meetings, confessed to feeling "very nervous" ahead of the early start time for the match. He conveyed his sympathy for Korda, recognizing his talent and the unfortunate circumstances surrounding his retirement from the tournament.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a notorious co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty to federal racketeering and criminal enterprise charges in a New York court, effectively ending his decades-long career in organized crime. Zambada expressed remorse for the immense harm caused by illegal drugs in both the U.S. and Mexico, accepting responsibility for his actions. His arrest in July 2024, reportedly after being lured to the U.S. by El Chapo's sons, paved the way for this plea deal, which ensures he will not face the death penalty. The article underscores Zambada's pivotal role in establishing the world's largest drug-trafficking organization and the current Trump administration's intensified pressure on Mexico to combat cartels.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket, aiming to validate numerous corrective upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. The mission seeks to test the Super Heavy first stage under stressful flight conditions and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory with planned in-space engine restarts and satellite deployments. A successful flight is crucial for restoring confidence in the vehicle, especially amidst growing concerns that its moon lander variant may not be ready for NASA's planned 2027 lunar landing. Despite past setbacks, SpaceX's rapid iteration approach offers hope for overcoming technical hurdles.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced a strategic plan to unwind its 2018 merger, intending to split into two distinct companies—one dedicated to coffee and the other to cold beverages—after completing an $18 billion acquisition of JDE Peet's, the parent of Peet's Coffee. This move aims to create more agile and focused entities, allowing each to better capitalize on growth opportunities within their specialized markets. The combined coffee business is projected to achieve $16 billion in annual net sales, bolstering its competitive standing against major players like Nestle and Starbucks in a growing global coffee market. Meanwhile, the new cold beverage company will be better positioned to adapt to evolving consumer tastes by focusing on faster-growing drink categories. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eric Thompson, a tech worker who experienced significant frustration with "ghost job" advertisements, is now spearheading a working group to propose federal legislation aimed at banning this deceptive practice. Ghost jobs are listings posted by companies without a specific intent to hire, often used for collecting resumes or signaling growth, which ultimately wastes job seekers' time and effort. The proposed Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA) seeks to mandate greater transparency in all public job listings, requiring information such as intended hire and start dates, and imposing limits on how long positions can be advertised. This grassroots effort aligns with a growing movement for hiring transparency, with similar legislative proposals emerging in various U.S. states and Canada.</p>
