        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks associated with the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) experienced gains, driven by renewed investor enthusiasm for stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets. Companies like BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, which have adopted ETH treasury strategies, saw significant stock jumps. This surge follows a period of struggle for Ethereum, which has faced an identity crisis and competition from other blockchains. The renewed interest is linked to the network's capability for smart contracts, making it a key platform for creating digital representations of traditional assets, a process highlighted by recent industry expansions.

Wigdor praised his client's strength, stating she brought necessary attention to the misconduct of powerful men in the entertainment industry.

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that women under 55 using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. The research distinguished between women with and without a uterus, as their treatments differ. For women who have had a hysterectomy, taking estrogen alone was found to actually reduce breast cancer risk. This new research refines previous understandings from a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting that the type and timing of hormone therapy are critical factors. Health experts stress the importance of personalized medical consultation to weigh the risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tibet's 89-year-old spiritual leader, has announced a formal succession plan, asserting that the process will be handled exclusively by his appointed trust, free from Chinese government interference. In a televised statement, he declared that the Gaden Phodrang Trust will consult with Tibetan Buddhist leaders to find his reincarnation according to traditional procedures. This move directly challenges Beijing, which passed a law in 2007 claiming authority over the selection of the next Dalai Lama and has long viewed the spiritual leader as a separatist. The announcement is politically and spiritually significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their identity and religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is taking a confrontational stance against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in her city. Accusing the president of an "all-out assault against Los Angeles," Bass has defended the city's sanctuary policies and vowed not to be intimidated by federal pressure, including a Justice Department lawsuit. This marks a shift in style for the mayor, who is typically known as a consensus builder. Her strong defense of the city's immigrant communities against federal raids has unified many local leaders and residents, who see the administration's actions as an overreach that runs counter to the city's values.</p>

          <p>The Senate-passed version of President Trump's domestic policy bill includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced chip-making facilities within the United States. The move expands on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and aligns with Washington's ongoing efforts to onshore the critical semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. While Trump has previously criticized CHIPS Act grants, the new tax credits could accelerate domestic investment by chipmakers. (not investment advice)</p>
