          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health will begin offering generic semaglutide in Canada, marking its entry into the country's market. This move capitalizes on the upcoming expiration of Novo Nordisk's patent for its popular weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. The Canadian market for these drugs is substantial, projected to grow significantly in the coming years. Hims & Hers aims to provide an affordable alternative, although it has not yet confirmed if it has applied for approval from Canada's health agency, stating it is working with an approved partner.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com has launched its "Double Hundred Plan," investing over $1.4 billion to bolster select brands and challenge competitors in the on-demand delivery sector. This initiative aims to increase sales for certain brands by offering enhanced traffic, marketing support, and better after-sales service. The move escalates the rivalry with market leader Meituan and Alibaba, which recently engaged in a price war and announced its own significant subsidy program. The competition comes as China's daily on-demand delivery orders have surpassed 200 million.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has announced its intention to continue investing in large-scale infrastructure projects to drive economic development. Li Chunlin, the NDRC's vice-chairman, emphasized the necessity of maintaining a significant level of investment to improve citizens' livelihoods, particularly as the country's per capita GDP surpasses $13,000. This strategy comes amid a push to boost domestic consumption as a buffer against trade tensions with the United States. The approach echoes past stimulus efforts but also raises concerns about potential increases in local government debt.</p>

          <h2>Australia Launches Pioneering Climate Visa Program for Tuvalu Residents</h2>

          <p>Australia has implemented a groundbreaking climate visa program for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia with a pathway to permanent residency. Unlike traditional visas, this "special mobility pathway" is not tied to specific employment or education and prioritizes those most in need, including individuals with disabilities. This proactive approach to climate mobility preserves dignity and agency, offering a potential model for other nations facing similar climate-induced displacement.</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old Customs and Border Protection beagle, is returning to work at Dulles International Airport two weeks after being intentionally kicked by a traveler. The incident occurred when Freddie alerted his handler to a bag containing prohibited agricultural items. The traveler, an Egyptian national, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal and was sentenced to time served, also paying the dog's veterinary fees. Freddie, a rescue dog, has a successful record of sniffing out thousands of pounds of prohibited items, protecting U.S. agriculture from potential pests and diseases.</p>

          <p>Plans are reportedly being developed for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the UK, specifically his Scottish golf courses, in late July or early August. Police Scotland has confirmed it is preparing for the event, which could require up to 5,000 officers and would be a significant policing operation. While a final date is not set, sources suggest the visit could last several days, including stops at his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire resorts. This would be Trump's first trip to Scotland since his election victory, with the visit reportedly tied to the opening of a new golf course.</p>

          <p>Small businesses facing financial headwinds and falling behind on tax payments have several relief options available through the IRS to avoid severe consequences like frozen accounts or asset liens. These programs are designed to help struggling entrepreneurs manage their obligations without shutting down. Key options include business installment agreements to pay off debt over time, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC) to settle for less than the full amount in cases of severe hardship. Other possibilities are a "Currently Not Collectible" status to temporarily pause collections and penalty abatement for specific circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Middle East is experiencing one of the world's most dramatic declines in fertility rates, a "quiet revolution" transforming its demographics. The average number of children per woman has more than halved since the 1960s, with several Arab nations now below the population replacement level. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of economic pressures, political instability, and significant social changes, including increased female education and employment. This shift could lead to future challenges, such as straining social safety nets with an aging population, but may also reduce environmental pressures.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its national disaster plan in response to an unprecedented swarm of over 1,700 tremors in the Tokara Islands since late June. While authorities state this is not a precursor to the feared Nankai Trough earthquake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The updated plan aims to reduce projected fatalities from a Nankai Trough event by 80% over the next decade. Measures include building taller sea walls, constructing tsunami refuge towers, and focusing heavily on public education for rapid evacuation, a key lesson from the 2011 Tohoku disaster.</p>

The company states the new offerings are almost 60% larger than its existing salads and are designed to meet a growing demand from office workers for more substantial, nutrient-rich lunch options. The move comes as the lunchtime market becomes increasingly competitive with more employees returning to the office post-pandemic. Pret's strategy appears to target a higher-end segment, competing with chains like Farmer J and Salad Project.</p>

The company, which recently opened its first LightSpray factory in Zurich, says the process dramatically reduces the manual labor involved in traditional shoemaking. On aims to scale this technology from producing thousands of pairs to millions, giving it a significant competitive edge through innovation.</p>

The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.77%, its lowest point in three months, prompting a rise in both purchase and refinance applications. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, growing housing inventory and moderating price growth are also helping to fuel homebuyer demand.
