          <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating whether a fire at Keir Starmer's London home is connected to two other recent fire incidents in the area. Counter-terrorism police are leading the probe as a precaution due to Starmer's high-profile status. While the cause of the fire is currently treated as suspicious, authorities are keeping an open mind regarding any connections between the three incidents. Starmer has expressed gratitude to the emergency services for their response, but declined further comment due to the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and his former personal lawyer, as the acting Librarian of Congress, prompting immediate resistance from library staff. Staff members refused access to two Justice Department officials chosen by Blanche for senior positions, citing the need for congressional input. The Library of Congress staff is currently recognizing Robert Newlen as the acting librarian, pending direction from Congress. Representative Joseph D.

          <p>Rising rent prices across the United States are making it increasingly difficult for renters to live comfortably, with Zillow calculating that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to afford the typical apartment rental.

The increasing cost of housing is outpacing wage growth, leading to financial strain for renters and highlighting the need for increased affordable housing options.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) can be a viable financing source for homeowners, with average interest rates under 8%. A HELOC can be used for financing home projects, especially those that qualify for tax deductions. It's also beneficial when price changes are affordable, considering the variable interest rate, and when seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to alternatives like home equity loans or personal loans. Borrowers should carefully consider their financial circumstances before using a HELOC, as the home is used as collateral.</p>
