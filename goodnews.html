          <p>A crew of four astronauts from the U.S., Japan, and Russia successfully completed their mission aboard the International Space Station, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. Their return marks the end of a mission that began when they relieved two NASA astronauts who were stranded on the station for nine months due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule. The successful splashdown, managed by SpaceX, was NASA's first in the Pacific in 50 years. Officials praised the mission's success and the crew's well-being upon their return after 146 days in orbit.</p>

          <p>The growing market for "functional beverages" that promise benefits like calm and relaxation is facing scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. Brands advertising ingredients like L-theanine and Lion's Mane have seen sales surge, but experts are skeptical that the small amounts of these supplements in the drinks can produce significant effects. One brand, Trip, had an advertisement banned for making unauthorized health claims about stress and anxiety. While some consumers enjoy them as non-alcoholic alternatives, psychologists suggest any calming effect may be a placebo created by the ritual of taking a moment for oneself.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is being honored with the National Order of Merit for his half-century of service. The 72-year-old, who began selling papers in 1973 when dozens of hawkers worked the city's streets, has become a beloved local figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood. Despite the decline in print sales due to the digital age, he continues his rounds for the joy and independence the job provides. The award from President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from him as a student, recognizes his unique contribution to French culture.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about identity in 2025. While some criticized him, others noted his Irish heritage and argued that cultural identity is more complex than just place of birth, especially for the diaspora. The article explores how "Irishness" is an evolving concept, encompassing a wide spectrum of influences from politics in Northern Ireland to the arts. It reflects a modern understanding where identity is not a binary choice but a blend of heritage, experience, and personal connection.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been so poorly received by critics that it has renewed interest in the cultural phenomenon of "bad movies." With an initial 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has intrigued some viewers who are drawn to cinematic failures, arguing they are often more memorable and entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters. Experts and film fans suggest that earnestly made but failed films have a certain charm. They provide a unique viewing experience that can build a cult following for being "so bad they're good."</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the global AI landscape by challenging the "bigger is better" assumption that had dominated Silicon Valley. The app demonstrated that a highly capable model could be built for a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts, signaling a major shift in the US-China AI rivalry. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, DeepSeek prompted a move toward developing smaller, more efficient models. The event has also been used by the US administration and tech companies to frame AI development as critical for national security.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock value increased by 13% this week, its most significant weekly gain since July 2020, adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance by CEO Tim Cook with President Trump, where the company announced plans to spend $100 billion on American suppliers and parts. This move, along with assurances that Apple would be exempt from certain future tariffs, eased investor concerns about the potential negative impact of trade policies on the company's profitability. The positive market performance also comes after a strong quarterly earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, recommending them as a key fruit for people over 50 to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these neuroprotective effects may help protect the brain from proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fresh fruit can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract is a year-round alternative, though consumers should avoid versions with added sugar.</p>
