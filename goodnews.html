          <p>Google has entered into an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, each capable of generating at least 600 megawatts of power. This move reflects Google's commitment to securing reliable, 24/7 baseload energy for its data centers, particularly in light of the increasing energy demands of artificial intelligence. Elementl Power, a nuclear power project developer founded in 2022, will use Google's early-stage capital for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations, aiming to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to the grid by 2035. This partnership underscores the growing trend of tech companies collaborating with the nuclear industry to meet their substantial energy needs. This article provides context for how Google is attempting to meet their energy demands.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has ruled in favor of the family of Amer Fakhoury, a Lebanese American man held hostage in Lebanon, holding Iran liable for his kidnap and torture through its proxy, Hezbollah. This is the first lawsuit to prove Iran's influence over Lebanon, according to Fakhoury's daughters. The family provided evidence of Hezbollah's control over Lebanese government agencies, leading to the court's decision. While grateful for the judgment, the family believes the settlement was insufficient and hopes to sanction Lebanese officials who collaborated with Hezbollah and Iran.
