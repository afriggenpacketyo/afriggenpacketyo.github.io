The House Agriculture Committee, Energy & Commerce Committee, and Ways & Means Committee are all holding meetings to address key aspects of Trump's priorities. Democrats are mounting strong opposition, particularly to proposed cuts to welfare programs like Medicaid and SNAP, leading to heated debates and even protests. Tensions also exist between moderate and conservative Republicans regarding the level of cuts to green energy tax subsidies and the state and local tax deduction cap.</p>

          <p>China has completed key technology checks for its Chutian-001 experimental satellite, a step towards building a 300-satellite constellation in very low Earth orbit (VLEO). The satellite demonstrated capabilities including precise control in low orbits, real-time target detection, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites, orbiting between 150km and 300km, offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission, but face challenges from atmospheric drag. The Chutian constellation project, a collaboration between China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp and the Hubei provincial government, aims to enhance China's commercial space sector.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The initiative aims to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94m annually by 2032. Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with roles created in other cities. The government wants 50% of senior civil servants based in regional offices by 2030, with departments submitting relocation plans. The Labour government is implementing reforms to reduce the civil service's size, aiming for a 15% reduction in running costs by the decade's end.</p>

          <p>Former Uruguayan President Jos√© Mujica, known as "Pepe", has died at the age of 89. He was known as the world's "poorest president" because of his modest lifestyle, the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Current President Yamand√∫ Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: "thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people."</p>
