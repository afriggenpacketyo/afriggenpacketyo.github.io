        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, signaling a temporary de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that both sides will reduce their tariffs to 10%, with China removing its countermeasures. This agreement comes after successful talks in Geneva aimed at establishing a basis for broader trade negotiations, which had been disrupted by President Trump's tariff measures in April. The effective tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. will be 30% during this period, while China's effective tariffs will be at 10%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Party has revealed its plans to reduce immigration into the UK, focusing on a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening skilled worker visa requirements, expanding eligibility for high-potential individual visas, and doubling the time immigrants must reside in the UK before applying for permanent residency to 10 years. The dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and overseas graduates will only be able to stay for 18 months post-studies. While aiming to significantly reduce net migration, the prime minister is not setting an overall cap.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Stars secured a critical 5-2 win over the Winnipeg Jets in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, taking a 2-1 series lead. A controversial goal by Alexander Petrovic, initially reviewed for a potential kicking motion, was ultimately allowed after officials ruled that Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck propelled the puck into his own net. Jets coach Scott Arniel contested the interpretation of the rule, while Stars coach Peter DeBoer expressed relief that officials took the time to review the play thoroughly. Mikko Rantanen also scored for the Stars shortly after play resumed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The spring art auctions are approaching cautiously, with auction houses recalibrating for an art market facing economic uncertainty and new challenges like tariffs. Estimates for high-end artworks have been adjusted, and the absence of headline-grabbing estates has led to a focus on conventional offerings. Despite these challenges, auction houses are still betting on a successful week of sales, with a combined estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. Key artworks to watch include a Giacometti bust and a Mondrian painting, which will serve as indicators of the art market's health.</p>

          <p>Analysts and strategists believe that the recent US-China tariff agreement could reignite risk-on sentiment, benefiting stocks and US assets. JPMorgan Asset Management's Tai Hui notes that the magnitude of the tariff reduction is larger than expected, though uncertainty remains regarding a more concrete trade arrangement. Mizuho Bank's Jordan Rochester suggests that the deal will squeeze the "Sell America" narrative. Wall Street strategists predict that stocks could rally further, with Barclays noting that there is still much dispersion between domestic and exporters and that overall positioning is light/defensive.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. rule mandates that hotel and short-term lodging companies disclose "junk fees," such as resort or destination fees, upfront. The rule, announced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), aims to curtail practices that allow businesses to charge more without appearing to raise prices. While the rule is designed to increase transparency, concerns have been raised about enforcement due to the Trump administration's efforts to reduce staff at the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

          <p>Research on wild chimpanzees has revealed two key building blocks of human speech: rhythmic structures and call combinations. Studies have found that chimps use drumming patterns with regional variations and combine calls to create new meanings, suggesting these abilities were present early in human evolution. These findings support research on communication in other primates and highlight the importance of rhythm and complex vocalizations in social behavior. However, wild chimpanzee populations are threatened by hunting, the pet trade, and habitat destruction, making such studies increasingly difficult.</p>

          <p>Contributors argue that Congress should modify the tax code to aid victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires, preventing burned lots from remaining empty for decades. The current tax law incentivizes fire victims to hold onto their properties until death to avoid income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales. They propose exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales and allowing income tax deferral for buyers who use sale proceeds to purchase or build new residences in the fire areas. These reforms aim to incentivize rebuilding and restore the tax base in affected communities.</p>

          <p>Langer's Delicatessen in Westlake is renowned for its pastrami sandwiches, particularly the pastrami dip. Served on a golden French roll from Fred's Bakery, the sandwich features a generous portion of RC Provisions' pastrami, known for its smoky flavor and tender texture. The jus, a salty and balanced broth, complements the meat perfectly. While the No. 19 is Langer's most popular order, the pastrami dip stands out for its simplicity and pure pastrami flavor, making it a quintessential Los Angeles sandwich experience.</p>

          <h2>PKK Announces Disbandment and End to Armed Struggle Against Turkey</h2>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) has announced that it will lay down arms and disband, ending its decades-long armed insurgency against the Turkish state. This decision follows a call from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to disarm and dissolve the organization. The PKK's insurgency, aimed initially at creating an independent Kurdish homeland, has resulted in over 40,000 deaths. The group's statement indicates a shift toward democratic politics and a desire for greater Kurdish rights through peaceful means. The future implications for Kurdish politics and regional stability remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have announced a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs in an effort to de-escalate trade tensions. The agreement, reached after weekend talks, involves a 90-day period during which the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China will lower import duties on American goods to 10%. This move comes after a barrage of tariffs announced by President Trump, which have created market volatility and strained relationships with trading partners. The agreement aims to prevent further economic downturn and address concerns about rising consumer prices and supply chain disruptions.</p>
