          <p>Eli Lilly has significantly raised its 2025 financial outlook after its second-quarter earnings surpassed analyst expectations, driven by massive sales of its diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion, attributing the growth to strong underlying business strength and high prescription volumes in the U.S. This positive forecast comes despite potential impacts from U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The strong performance highlights the company's dominant position in the rapidly expanding market for GLP-1 medications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, resulted in an average weight loss of nearly 12% in a late-stage clinical trial, a figure that fell short of some Wall Street expectations. Consequently, the company's shares dropped around 13% following the news. While some doctors noted the discontinuation rate due to side effects, others praised the result as a significant step for oral weight-loss treatments, which could expand access for patients hesitant about injections. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing a pandemic, high inflation, and rising interest rates, the U.S. stock market has continued to soar, defying traditional economic explanations. This article explores several evolving theories for this resilience, moving beyond fundamentals and Federal Reserve liquidity. More recent explanations point to a speculative bubble driven by hype around artificial intelligence, or a structural market shift caused by the dominance of passive investing. This latter theory suggests that automated, consistent buying from passive funds creates a market that is less sensitive to downturns and more prone to sustained rallies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 7, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,387.35 per ounce, reflecting its status as a significant investment commodity. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by a variety of factors, including fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. It is often considered a safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty or when fiat currencies weaken. Interest rates also play a crucial inverse role, as higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

Walecki was known for his integrity, his knack for matchmaking musicians with the right gear, and his role as a supportive friend.
