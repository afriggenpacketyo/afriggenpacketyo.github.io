          <p>Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon title, a surprising victory on what was considered her weakest surface. The 24-year-old, known as the 'Queen of Clay,' defeated Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in a dominant final performance that lasted just 57 minutes. This marks her sixth Grand Slam title overall but her first major win on grass, a significant milestone that she described as "surreal." The victory follows a challenging year for Swiatek, who had previously struggled to find her top form after a dominant run as world number one.</p>

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber, one of only two airworthy in the world, made a precautionary landing after experiencing an engine problem during a families' day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the historic Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) aircraft diagnosed unusual engine behavior and safely returned to its base at RAF Coningsby. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines before it issued a general emergency alert. No one was injured, and the RAF has launched an investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime games to address concerns about extreme heat. This comes after players described conditions at the current Club World Cup in the U.S. as "very dangerous." The plan is to schedule more matches in the four host cities with indoor venues—Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver—during the hottest parts of the day. Infantino also declared the revamped 32-team Club World Cup a major financial success for the organization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed campaign of tariff threats against major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has remained resilient, with major indices near all-time highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are less prone to panic than they were during previous trade disputes. The market's focus appears to be on other factors, such as the potential for deregulation and the significant economic growth driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, which are seen as outweighing the immediate risks of the tariff rhetoric.

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the numbers. The closures are primarily due to the end of a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, which involved small food court kiosks rather than full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe stated the move is about focusing on "quality, not quantity" and that the kiosks were not significant revenue drivers. The company is also refreshing its brand by updating its menu with new, summer-inspired items.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are launching a campaign for a judicial review of government guidance on smartphones in schools, aiming for a complete ban. They argue the current policy, which leaves the decision to headteachers, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content, cyberbullying, and predators. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>
