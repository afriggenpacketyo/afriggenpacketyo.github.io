          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 18:07:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses Justice Clarence Thomas's long-held belief in individual rights over group rights and how it has influenced the Supreme Court's recent decisions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Thomas has consistently argued that American law should protect individual rights rather than group rights, criticizing the use of social science evidence in cases like Brown v. Board of Education. The recent Supreme Court decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote, signals a shift away from DEI programs that favor certain groups, aligning with Thomas's view that American law protects individual rights. Thomas suggests that DEI initiatives have often led to discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement agreement with the NCAA, which allows schools to directly pay athletes. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing, maintaining Olympic sports programs and current scholarship limits for at least a year. Revenue will be shared primarily with football and men's basketball players, following a formula similar to the back-payment model. The ability to pay players directly could help UCLA compete with other Big Ten schools and narrow the resource gap.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest. The eaglet, born in March, spent several days practicing by flapping her wings and jumping between branches. The flight occurred around 8:27 a.m. local time, with Gizmo initially landing on another tree before disappearing from view. Her sister, Sunny, took her first flight earlier in the week, and both eaglets are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>
