          <p>A recent mutual defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is not anticipated to disrupt Saudi Arabia's established energy relationship with India, a significant crude oil consumer. Sources familiar with the matter emphasize Riyadh's strategy to broaden its security alliances while safeguarding its vital commercial interests, particularly with key customers like India. The article also addresses and dismisses ongoing speculation regarding a shift from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade, affirming the dollar's foundational role in crude exports. While India's Ministry of External Affairs is studying the pact's implications for national and regional security, analysts foresee minimal long-lasting effects on global oil prices, with WTI futures expected to remain near $65 per barrel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are increasingly highlighting the vital role of protein in maintaining healthy hair, beyond its well-known benefits for muscle building. Hair, primarily made of keratin, requires sufficient protein intake; a deficiency can lead to shedding, thinning, and increased breakage, as the body diverts amino acids to more critical organs. Hair transplant surgeons confirm that correcting protein levels often results in improved hair strength and density within a few months. While protein supplements can be useful for those struggling to meet daily targets, a balanced diet rich in amino acids like lysine and cysteine from sources such as eggs, fish, and legumes is considered superior for fostering robust hair growth.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid publicly praised Travis Kelce's "passion" following their second sideline confrontation in consecutive weeks during the team's 22-9 win against the New York Giants. Reid, who admitted to bumping Kelce's shoulder during the exchange, stated he was "OK with that" and believed the team needed more of that intensity in the second quarter. Despite Kelce's past emotional outbursts, including throwing his helmet and physically confronting Reid in previous games, quarterback Patrick Mahomes affirmed the strong relationship between the coach and player. This article highlights that while such incidents could signal discord, the team leaders frame it as an expression of Kelce's dedication, which has been integral to his success.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a £2.2 billion privately-financed project designed to boost economic growth. The expansion entails moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular operation and enlarging terminal facilities, with an aim to increase annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates thousands of jobs and billions in investment, the decision faces strong opposition from the Green Party and environmental organizations, who argue it disregards climate science and exacerbates the climate crisis. Local communities also voice concerns over increased noise and traffic, with some advocating for a judicial review.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article elucidates the fundamental differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, providing essential insights for investors aiming to diversify their portfolios. ETFs trade dynamically on stock exchanges, allowing for real-time pricing, whereas mutual fund transactions are processed directly with the fund at the end-of-day price. A notable advantage of ETFs is their superior tax efficiency, as they typically avoid distributing capital gains to shareholders in taxable brokerage accounts, unlike many mutual funds. Additionally, ETFs generally incur lower fees due to more favorable expense ratios. However, mutual funds offer a broader selection of investment strategies and are more commonly integrated into 401(k) retirement plans, sometimes limiting investor choice for ETFs.

However, the article highlights a discernible shift away from early-stage startup and seed funding, with a growing preference for less risky growth-stage investments. Family offices are particularly bullish on specific long-term themes, such as the artificial intelligence boom and associated infrastructure demands, rather than broad asset classes. They are also capitalizing on opportunistic plays in secondary sales, acquiring illiquid assets from institutional investors, leveraging their consistent cash flow from existing operating businesses.

Citing concerns about addictive algorithms and excessive phone usage, the party asserts that social media platforms present public health risks akin to those associated with cigarettes or alcohol. Technology spokesperson Victoria Collins clarified that these mandatory alerts aim to inform teenagers of the risks rather than prohibit their online interactions. This article also notes that the Labour government is concurrently exploring similar time restrictions and a 22:00 curfew, building upon existing regulations that have already introduced stricter age verification and algorithm adjustments for minors.</p>

          <p>A Romanian tourist, identified as Ovidiu A., endured nearly a month in an Italian prison after being mistakenly apprehended as a wanted criminal on the initial day of his vacation. His arrest occurred when his hotel registration triggered an alert, as he shared the same name as a fugitive previously sentenced to two years for aggravated theft. His lawyer encountered significant difficulties in proving the case of mistaken identity, primarily due to the lack of interconnected computer systems across various Italian police, prison, and court authorities. The article reports that Ovidiu A. has since been released and, despite the "enormous damage" and "nightmare" experience, plans to resume his holiday in Italy before returning home, demonstrating remarkable dignity and calm throughout the ordeal.</p>
