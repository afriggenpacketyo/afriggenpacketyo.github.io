          <p>In Jackson, Michigan, the Downtown Development Authority is partnering with Central Michigan Paranormal Investigators (CMPI) to host ghost tours in the historic Commercial Exchange Building. The event serves as a Halloween-season fundraiser, with proceeds supporting downtown preservation and community initiatives. Investigators use equipment like K-2 meters to detect what they believe is spirit activity in the building, where they claim to have previously seen a "full-body spirit." Organizers have reduced ticket prices to make the spooky adventure more accessible for families and highlight local businesses.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, will have a felony charge against him reduced to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested and charged with felony obstruction while protesting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Los Angeles business earlier this year. His arrest became a rallying point for immigrant advocates and was condemned by Democratic leaders, who called it a politically motivated act of retaliation by the Trump administration. Huerta's attorneys stated they will seek a speedy trial to vindicate him, maintaining there were no grounds for the initial charges.</p>

          <p>With the average cost of a Halloween costume rising, Austin resident Christophe Waggoner is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes for free. Waggoner spends his time thrifting for materials—looking for anything shiny, furry, or sparkly—which he then redesigns and sews into unique outfits. He hosts events where children can pick out a costume, ensuring they can experience the joy of the holiday regardless of their family's financial situation. Waggoner, who spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on the project, says his goal is to inspire a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds that utilize options-based strategies for greater stability. These funds can offer more reliable downside protection and provide an income stream that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is particularly relevant in the current rate-cutting cycle. The manager suggests that demand for income and defense against equity drawdowns is a long-term trend. He advises investors to seek out option income ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields with high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Data Suggests Men Are More Likely Than Women to Expedite Relationship Milestones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to settle down, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute found that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The study of 2,000 U.S. singles indicated that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. However, experts suggest a deeper reason is that heterosexual men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships as their primary source of social and emotional support. This contrasts with women, who tend to build and maintain stronger support networks through friendships and family.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago’s O’Hare airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing to its gate. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved one plane's wing striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway collisions and near misses at U.S. airports.</p>

          <p>In a competitive job market, many job seekers are using inexpensive and fast AI tools to create professional headshots for their LinkedIn profiles and resumes, bypassing the high cost of traditional photographers.

However, this trend raises ethical questions about authenticity among recruiters, who are wary of overly stylized or deceptive images.

Greene emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and recommends students apply for 100 to 200 scholarships in total.
