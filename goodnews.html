          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. In this prominent role, Cleverly will directly challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The shake-up also includes several other changes, such as Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief, and is described by the party as reflecting a new stage in its policy renewal program. The reshuffle aims to unify the party and present a stronger opposition to the Labour government.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after saving his four-year-old child by pulling them from the jaws of a mountain lion during a hike in Washington's Olympic National Park. The attack occurred on a well-traveled trail, and the child was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center and has since been discharged. Park rangers later located and euthanized the animal, which had been fitted with a GPS collar. Officials emphasized that such attacks are extremely rare, with only two recorded fatalities from mountain lions in Washington over the past century.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two uplifting stories of individuals making a positive impact. Brian Flynn, seeking more meaning in his life, became a rare double living organ donor, first giving a kidney to a stranger and later donating part of his liver to save a four-year-old boy. In another story, teenager Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, used her experience to invent "Infusion Hero," a sweatshirt with a zippered sleeve to keep patients warm and comfortable during IV treatments. Both individuals have found purpose and passion through their efforts to help others facing medical challenges.</p>

          <p>Senedd (Welsh Parliament) member Laura Anne Jones has defected from the Conservative Party to join Reform, becoming the party's first representative in the Welsh legislature. Announced by Reform leader Nigel Farage, the high-profile defection comes as Jones stated the Conservative Party was "unrecognizable" to her. The move was met with anger by Welsh Conservatives, who said voters would feel let down. The defection adds to the pressure on the Conservative party in Wales, where recent polls have suggested Reform could become the largest party in the next Senedd election.</p>

          <h2>An Explanation of Credit Card Payment Grace Periods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the concept of credit card grace periods for consumers. It distinguishes between the grace period on new purchases, which allows users to avoid interest by paying their balance in full each month, and the common misconception of a grace period for late payments. Most credit card issuers do not offer a formal grace period after a due date has passed, meaning late fees and penalty APRs can be applied immediately. The article advises consumers who may miss a payment to contact their card company proactively, as some may offer informal leeway, especially for customers with a good payment history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates and maintained its full-year financial guidance, despite facing significant headwinds from U.S. auto tariffs. The company revealed that tariffs had a $1.1 billion negative impact on its quarterly results, a figure in line with its overall forecast for a $4 to $5 billion hit for the year. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives. The automaker is also navigating shifting demand for electric vehicles following changes to federal tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Harvard University study suggests that the sex of a couple's children may not be a simple 50/50 probability with each birth. After analyzing the records of over 58,000 women, researchers found that families exhibit a "weighted coin toss" tendency. If a family's first two children are the same sex, the likelihood of the third child also being that sex increases significantly. The study identified a woman's age at her first birth as one potential factor, though the precise biological mechanism remains uncertain and requires further research.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic suggests that the increasing prevalence of low-quality, unreliable, and sometimes bizarre AI-generated content—or "slop"—is degrading the online experience. This degradation, from AI-written dating profiles to factually incorrect search results, could have an unintended positive consequence: encouraging people to spend less time online. The author argues that as the internet becomes less trustworthy and less fun, the real world, with its tangible interactions and reliable information sources like books, becomes more appealing. This trend might inadvertently help cure the widespread problem of internet addiction.</p>

          <p>Singer Billy Joel recently spoke about his diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition that led him to cancel his tour two months ago. He described one of the primary symptoms as a constant feeling of poor balance, likening it to "being on a boat." The 76-year-old musician reassured fans that while the condition is still being treated, he feels good and that the diagnosis sounds worse than his actual physical state. Normal pressure hydrocephalus involves a buildup of fluid in the brain and is more common in people over 65.</p>

The DeHaven sank with 167 crew members on board during the Guadalcanal campaign.

          <p>English football club Crystal Palace has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote them from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League. The punishment was issued due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor has stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. If the punishment is upheld, Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest are expected to take Palace's spot. The club argues that Textor does not hold decisive influence and is hopeful the decision will be overturned.</p>

CEO James Quincey clarified that the new offering will complement the existing portfolio rather than replace it, describing it as an "and" strategy, not an "or" strategy.
