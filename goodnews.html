        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a U.S. port fee aimed at ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. These companies cite China's unmatched competitiveness and capabilities in shipbuilding, particularly for vessels needed in the energy transition. MSC's senior vice-president stated that the port fee would not deter them from ordering more ships from China, emphasizing the country's competence and capacity. She noted that reviving America‚Äôs shipbuilding sector would require state subsidies and the retention of some strategic assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This guest essay reflects on the victory of a horse named Journalism at the Preakness Stakes, highlighting the importance of patience and strategic timing. Journalism, initially boxed in and fading, demonstrated resilience by waiting for an opportunity to surge through a narrow opening in the final stretch. The horse's ability to overcome obstacles and make up significant ground in the last moments secured a win, serving as a reminder that victories are sometimes earned through calculated patience rather than immediate speed. Journalism is now set to compete in the Belmont Stakes, which is shorter than usual due to renovations at Belmont Park.</p>

          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, despite economists' median estimates of 5.75%. The decision follows a better-than-expected GDP growth figure in the fiscal fourth quarter, with the economy expanding 7.4% year-on-year. The RBI has maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, and this decision comes amid concerns about growth and a downtrend in inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%.</p>

Sato pitches for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Intercounty Baseball League, receiving widespread media attention and fan support. Despite the attention, Sato remains focused on self-improvement rather than proving she can compete with men. Her trailblazing efforts coincide with the upcoming launch of a new U.S. women's pro league in 2026, where she serves as a special advisor, signaling an exciting time for women's baseball in North America.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. The judge, based in Massachusetts, stated that the university would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to take effect. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has reiterated the need for the United States to reconsider higher import duties imposed by Washington during a meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa is in Washington for tariff talks, aiming to pave the way for a meeting between the countries' leaders in mid-June. He emphasized the importance of a win-win deal, while Japan weighs accepting a cut in the rates as the U.S. resists a full removal of the duties. Under Trump's reciprocal tariff regime, Japan faces a total tariff rate of 24 percent, affecting various sectors including automobiles.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts, only to reverse the decision hours later. This reversal came after an X user advised Musk to "cool off and take a step back." The initial tweet followed Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill, sparking a war of words between the two. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, highlighting the potential implications of Musk's initial decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend sees retailers and food brands offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods. This has led to the launch of ranges like M&S's Only, featuring items with six or fewer ingredients, appealing to consumers with allergies despite higher prices. Plant-based brands like THIS are also responding by introducing less-processed options, aiming to address consumer hesitation towards artificial additives. However, nutritionists caution against equating fewer ingredients with better health, emphasizing the importance of fortified nutrients and the essential role of processed food in feeding a large population.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum communication technology in a space flight, marking a step towards building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight, assessing their robustness against vibration and radiation. The test aims to transition from experimental validation to a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered complementary to quantum key distribution (QKD), offering a more efficient and potentially more secure method of communication by skipping the key-sharing step.</p>
