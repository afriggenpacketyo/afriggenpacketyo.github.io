        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt collectors may be illegally re-aging old debts, a practice where they reset the clock on expired debts to make them appear newer on credit reports. This allows them to pursue payment more aggressively, even taking legal action that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. Consumers can identify re-aging by checking credit reports for debts that reappear after seven years or have suspiciously recent delinquency dates. If re-aging is suspected, individuals should file a dispute with credit bureaus and report the debt collector to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect their credit history.</p>

          <p>Numerous U.S. multinational corporations, including Apple, Microsoft, and Pfizer, have established operations in Ireland to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates. By stowing intellectual property in Ireland, these companies reduce their effective tax rates, as evidenced by the European Commission's findings regarding Apple's tax rate in Europe. The Irish government opened its doors to multinational corporations following an economic crisis in the 1980s, and many companies adopted strategies like the "double Irish" to minimize their tax liabilities.

This verdict provides hope that there is new awareness around sexual assault and the myth of the perfect victim is fading. Haley's testimony, which included detailed accounts of the assault, contributed to the jury's decision despite a mistrial being declared on another charge.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted traditional inflation measures. Recent data on consumer and producer prices indicate only modest increases. Experts suggest that factors like companies stockpiling imported goods, the time lag for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power have kept inflation in check. However, economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will materialize in the coming months, potentially leading to price increases driven by Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. The Social Security Administration attributes this to a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and people refiling for higher benefits based on their own records. However, concerns about the economic future under the Trump administration are also driving some individuals to claim benefits earlier than planned. Many are worried about potential cuts to Social Security and Medicaid, leading them to claim benefits while they still can.</p>
