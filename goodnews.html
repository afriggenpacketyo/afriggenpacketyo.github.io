DNA testing confirmed the identity with 99.9994% certainty, providing closure for his family and the search and rescue team who had worked the case for nearly three decades.

          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year deal, reportedly worth an average of $325 million annually, to acquire the U.S. rights for WWE's major live premium events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. This agreement marks a significant shift from NBCUniversal's Peacock, which previously held the streaming rights. The events will primarily stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with select simulcasts on linear networks. This strategic partnership aims to expand WWE's audience, particularly among younger, more diverse, and female demographics, leveraging ESPN's broad reach beyond traditional sports.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to announce an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. This move, celebrated by the White House, aims to reshore critical component production and protect national security. The decision comes as Apple seeks to mitigate the impact of President Trump's threatened tariffs, particularly on goods from India, which recently saw tariffs doubled to 50%. The tech giant has been under pressure to increase domestic production, despite analysts noting the significant cost implications of shifting its complex global supply chain.
