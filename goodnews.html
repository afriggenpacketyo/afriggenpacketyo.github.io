        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with a game to spare. Jos Buttler's strong performance, along with contributions from Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell, helped England chase down a target of 197. Despite a late surge from West Indies in their innings, England's batting lineup proved too strong, sealing a four-wicket victory with nine balls remaining. Adil Rashid's expensive over proved a costly factor as the series concludes at Southampton on Tuesday and there are areas for improvement.</p>

          <p>BowFlex is recalling millions of adjustable dumbbells due to the risk of weight plates dislodging and causing injuries. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported over 100 injuries, including concussions and broken toes.

Johnson Health Tech Retail, which acquired BowFlex assets after its bankruptcy, will provide refunds in the form of vouchers or replacement units for purchases made through them; BowFlex customers can request a prorated voucher and a digital fitness membership.

          <p>Despite Germany's 2-0 defeat to France in the Nations League third-placed playoff, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was a standout performer, making several crucial saves. However, ter Stegen's club situation at Barcelona is uncertain, as he has been largely overlooked by coach Hansi Flick in favor of Wojciech Szczesny. Reports suggest that Barcelona may sign another goalkeeper, potentially making ter Stegen third choice. Despite the lack of club games, Germany's coach, Julian Nagelsmann, has confirmed that ter Stegen is the first choice keeper for the national team.</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were diverted to Rome because the aircraft was too large to land at Naples Airport.
