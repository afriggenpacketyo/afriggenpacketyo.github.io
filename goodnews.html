          <h2>China's Panda Diplomacy in Focus as Japan Faces Potential Panda Absence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches a potential period without giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two nations, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions, and China may announce a new loan during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan. However, some experts are skeptical that a new panda loan will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture toward China.</p>

          <h2>Phrases That Make Kids Not Want to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a researcher identified five phrases that make children less likely to cooperate. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, the researcher suggests using phrases that honor a child's autonomy and foster cooperation, such as explaining the reasoning behind decisions, giving children agency over when they're ready to meet boundaries, and validating their emotions. This approach aims to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, reducing power struggles and raising emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro injections, aimed at aiding weight loss, will be available at GP surgeries in England for eligible patients with specific health criteria. NHS England plans a phased approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. To qualify, patients must have a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and meet specific health conditions. Some GP practices are warning ineligible patients not to book appointments for the jabs, and pharmacy trade organizations express concerns that demand may outstrip supply.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, straining his minority government in national politics. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, won the most seats, indicating the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The LDP secured only 22 seats, falling below its previous record-low of 23 in 2017. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito party won 17 and 19 seats, respectively, and voter turnout increased compared to the previous election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This dominance is attributed to long-term planning, government funding, and the ability to mobilize vast sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. This has also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production, creating the world's largest public charging network.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year, offering the Category B drug as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution over ketamine therapy, but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy hit two home runs and drove in seven runs, matching a career-high, as the Dodgers defeated the Washington Nationals 13-7. Muncy's performance overshadowed Shohei Ohtani's second pitching start of the season, where Ohtani pitched a scoreless first inning with two strikeouts. Ohtani also contributed with a bases-loaded triple and a two-run homer, but Muncy's grand slam in the sixth inning shifted the game's momentum. This performance continues Muncy's impressive mid-season turnaround, making him a key player for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack attributed hospital staff's reluctance to administer necessary drugs for her ectopic pregnancy to fearmongering by the left regarding the state's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, had to show hospital staff the state law and contact the governor's office before receiving treatment. She blames messaging from pro-abortion groups for creating fear of criminal charges, even though the treatment she needed was not banned under Florida‚Äôs restrictive statutes. Cammack hopes her experience will help opposing political groups find common ground, emphasizing the need for women to receive care during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies.</p>
