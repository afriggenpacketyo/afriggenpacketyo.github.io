          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative store of value. The Senate recently advanced crypto legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong inflows, and public companies now hold 15% of the total bitcoin supply. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a ruling concerning President Donald Trump's ability to fire members of other federal agencies' boards, the Supreme Court suggested that Federal Reserve board members would have special protection against being fired by a president. The court distinguished the Federal Reserve as a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity" following the historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States. While the decision allows Trump to remove two members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, it implies that any attempt to fire a Federal Reserve board member would face strong resistance from the current Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. The order prevents the administration from firing half of the DOE's workforce and transferring management of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun criticized the administration's claim that the changes were to improve efficiency, stating they would make it "effectively impossible" for the department to carry out its mandated functions. The ruling is a response to a challenge from state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits arguing that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be at their lowest level since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, with an average of $3.08 per gallon. This is attributed to uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses are up, including entertainment and dining out. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama are expected to have the lowest average gas prices, while California, Hawaii, and Washington will have the highest.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the populist narrative of America's economic decline due to globalization and neoliberalism is historically inaccurate. He contends that there never was a market-worshiping era of pure globalization and that wages stagnated mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, not during the 1990s and early 2000s. He also argues that American manufacturing jobs have declined mostly due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. Brooks suggests that the forces driving global populism are primarily about immigration, cultural values, and social distrust, not economic decline.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, compared to DDP-4 inhibitors. The study found a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause in patients taking GLP-1s. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had an 8% lower risk of obesity-related cancer and a 20% lower risk of all causes of death.
