          <p>Japan and the United States are engaged in ongoing negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement, though significant differences remain on tariff issues. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which it asserts are negatively impacting the Japanese economy. Both countries aim to finalize a deal by mid-June, coinciding with a planned meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. The negotiations involve discussions on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, with Japan presenting proposals to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products.

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England and Wales, forecasting heavy rainfall, frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds. Some areas could experience more rain in a single hour than they did throughout the entire month of May, potentially disrupting transport and causing power outages. While thunderstorms are difficult to predict precisely, the weather agency advises that driving conditions may be hazardous due to spray and standing water, and train services could face delays. Despite the unsettled weather, Sunday is expected to be brighter with fewer showers, though isolated thunderstorms remain a possibility.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is culminating in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade, marking the first time the city has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000. The event also commemorates the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest Pride celebrations in the country. Despite the usual scale, organizers note a dampened enthusiasm due to the current political climate, including executive orders limiting trans rights and a decline in corporate sponsorships following restrictions on "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the event has sparked controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts recommend several exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving flexibility. These exercises include foot doming to target the "foot core," wall stretches to relieve pain from plantar fasciitis, and toe spreads to improve flexibility and motor control. Toe yoga, calf raises, and foot massages are also suggested to enhance balance, stability, and overall foot health. Regular foot exercises can reduce injury risk, prevent pain, and improve foot health, but consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with preexisting foot conditions.</p>
