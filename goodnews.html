          <p>President Trump suggested a potential "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll them. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. Harvard sued, arguing the school was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. The potential deal comes after Trump issued an order barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard. </p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of many semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has expressed his support for such bans, potentially making Rhode Island the eleventh state with a prohibition on these firearms. The bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession, and aims to align Rhode Island with neighboring states on gun control measures. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

          <p>As office dress codes become more relaxed, the appropriateness of wearing shorts to work remains a contentious issue. Many companies are shifting away from formal dress codes, allowing employees to dress comfortably and professionally. However, stylists suggest that wearing shorts is context-dependent, often too casual for client-facing roles. The type of shorts matters, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than beach, sports, or denim shorts, though some companies allow more creative expression through clothing choices. </p>
