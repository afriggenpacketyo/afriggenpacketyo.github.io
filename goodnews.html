          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first win as head coach for the University of North Carolina, leading the Tar Heels to a 20-3 victory over Charlotte. The game followed an embarrassing season-opening loss and showed signs of improvement for the team. Following the win, Belichick addressed reports about his relationship with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC facilities. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome at his, highlighting the deteriorated relationship since his departure in 2024.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China's recent expansion of coal power capacity, while seemingly a setback for climate goals, is a pragmatic strategy to support its massive transition to renewable energy. The country added a record 212GW of solar capacity in the first half of the year, leading to increased power curtailment where generated clean energy cannot be used. Simultaneously, droughts have reduced hydropower output. In this context, new coal plants act as a crucial backup system, providing grid stability during peak demand and ensuring a reliable power supply while the renewable infrastructure, including new transmission lines, is fully integrated.</p>

          <p>Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, racing from Newcastle to South Shields. The event drew over 200,000 spectators who cheered on elite athletes and charity fundraisers, many in costume. Sheila Chepkirui won the women's elite race, while Alex Mutiso secured victory in the men's competition. The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, noted its growing popularity, particularly among younger people and women, who now comprise nearly half of the participants. The run continues to be an iconic event for the North East, celebrating community, fitness, and charitable giving.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The second-hand fashion app Vinted, now a billion-dollar company, originated from a simple problem faced by its co-founder, Milda Mitkutė, in 2008: she had too many clothes for her new, smaller apartment. After discussing the idea of selling her unwanted items online with friend Justas Janauskas at a party, they quickly launched a basic website. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a "buy" button, the platform's popularity grew through word of mouth, expanding from Lithuania to Germany and beyond. Vinted overcame a major crisis in 2016 after a failed attempt to introduce seller fees, eventually becoming Lithuania's first tech unicorn by focusing on a user-friendly, fee-free model for sellers.</p>

          <p>Currently, 147 out of 193 UN member nations officially recognize the Palestinian territories as a state, a number that has grown amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In May 2024, a UN General Assembly resolution supporting Palestinian statehood passed with 143 votes, though full membership requires Security Council approval, which has been blocked by a U.S. veto. Several Western nations, including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, have recently granted formal recognition, citing Israel's conduct in the war. More countries like France and Canada have announced their intention to do the same, signaling a significant shift from the long-held stance of recognizing Palestine only as part of a comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

          <h2>Data Analysis Reveals Best and Worst States for Powerball Winners After Taxes</h2>

          <p>Following the $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot win, a data analysis highlights how location significantly impacts a winner's take-home prize due to state taxes. While the IRS imposes a federal tax of about 37%, some states levy additional income taxes that can exceed 10%, while others charge none at all. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to maximize their prize. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This breakdown underscores the considerable financial advantage for jackpot winners residing in states without a lottery tax.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced an agreement with the U.S. for the release of over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown, targeted a battery plant under construction, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 people in total. Following negotiations, South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home, resolving a situation that had caused "concern and regret" for the close U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has admitted that he probably should have played more domestic cricket during his first home summer in the international squad. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who made a strong impression during his debut Test series last winter, has had a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his place in the Test XI and served as a spare batter for four matches against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of playing time but suggested the break might have been beneficial ahead of a busy upcoming cricket schedule.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a widespread and often asymptomatic condition known as the "silent killer," affecting over half of Americans by age 40. New American Heart Association guidelines recommend initiating treatment once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg to prevent severe health issues like heart disease, stroke, and dementia. For initial stages, lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction are advised. For higher readings (140/90 or above), starting with two types of medication is recommended, as evidence shows this is more effective for lowering blood pressure into a healthy range.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proliferation of advanced surveillance technologies, from satellite imagery and camera traps to home security cameras and drones, is making it increasingly difficult for animals to remain unseen. This constant monitoring raises philosophical and ethical questions about whether animals have a right to privacy. Some philosophers argue they do, pointing to behaviors like seeking seclusion or altering communication to avoid being overheard, suggesting an interest in controlling their social exposure. While surveillance can aid conservation, it can also lead to harm, such as disturbing nesting birds or enabling poaching. The issue is particularly acute for pets, who are subject to constant human control over their space and intimacy.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have continued their record-breaking surge, gaining approximately 35% this year to reach nearly $3,600 an ounce, attracting significant investor attention. Analysts attribute the rally to gold's status as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tension, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. For those looking to invest, most financial experts recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), citing their liquidity and cost-effectiveness over physical bullion. Despite the strong performance, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
