          <p>The Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for her persistent and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights in Venezuela. The announcement came amid widespread calls from some circles for President Donald Trump to receive the award for his role in brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas. The article notes that while Trump received several nominations, the deadline had passed before the deal was finalized, making him potentially eligible for next year's prize instead. Machado's selection is seen as a significant international recognition of the pro-democracy movement in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The Tenement Museum in New York City provides an immersive educational experience by recreating the historic apartments of immigrant and working-class families from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum aims to make history tangible for students by focusing on the lives of ordinary people, contrasting with traditional history lessons centered on major political figures. Through detailed reconstructions and storytelling, visitors can explore the daily struggles and triumphs of families who lived in the building. This approach helps students connect with the past on a personal level and understand the diverse fabric of the American story.</p>

          <p>At just 19 years old, Arjun Malaviya from Southern California has visited 118 countries, becoming one of the youngest people to achieve such a feat solo. He began his 13-month journey on his 17th birthday, self-funding the entire $22,500 trip through various jobs. Malaviya focused on connecting with local communities, from visiting remote villages in Oceania to conversing with a Taliban guard in Afghanistan. His travels, documented across five full passports, were driven by a desire to understand different cultures and demonstrate that people worldwide share more similarities than differences, aiming to inspire other young people to explore the world.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have started pulling back from several areas in the Gaza Strip as the first phase of a new ceasefire agreement gets underway. The deal, brokered with international mediation, involves a staggered Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the release of the remaining 48 hostages held by Hamas. As part of the initial steps, Israeli troops will fall back to positions controlling 53% of Gaza, with further withdrawals planned if the ceasefire holds. The United States is deploying a 200-person military team to help oversee the agreement, though they will not enter Gaza.</p>

          <p>German long-distance runner Lea Meyer is being praised for bringing attention to the mental health struggles faced by competitive athletes. In a candid interview after a disappointing performance, Meyer emphasized that an athlete's identity and value extend beyond their sporting results, a message that resonated widely. Sports psychologists note that while Germany has made progress in destigmatizing mental health issues, the culture remains heavily focused on performance. Meyer's vulnerability is seen as a significant step in reminding the public and sports institutions to view athletes as whole people, not just medal winners.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church in Kenya has introduced a new, exclusively controlled brand of altar wine after its previous type became commonly sold and consumed in secular bars and hotels. The former wine's widespread availability was seen by many faithful as diminishing its sacredness. The new Mass Wine, imported from South Africa, will be distributed solely through official diocesan channels and features the coat of arms of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) to certify its authenticity. This move is intended to restore the sanctity of the wine used to symbolize the blood of Christ during Mass.</p>

          <p>Decades of global conservation efforts have successfully brought the green turtle back from the brink of extinction, according to the latest Red List of endangered species. Once listed as endangered due to extensive hunting for its meat, eggs, and shells, the species has now been downgraded to "Least Concern." This remarkable recovery is attributed to widespread initiatives such as protecting nesting sites, reducing accidental capture in fishing nets, and raising public awareness. Scientists are hailing this as a major conservation victory, demonstrating that concerted international action can effectively save threatened species, though continued efforts are still necessary.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will track when non-EU citizens, including those from the UK, enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area. On their first use, travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, which will eventually replace the stamping of passports. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays and queues at borders like Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial registration phase.</p>

          <p>India has announced it is reopening its embassy in Kabul, four years after shutting it down following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed during a landmark visit to India by Afghanistan's Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. This move signifies a major diplomatic shift, upgrading India's previous "Technical Mission" to a full embassy, even though New Delhi does not formally recognize the Taliban government. The development reflects India's commitment to regional stability and providing humanitarian aid, occurring as the Taliban's relationship with India's rival, Pakistan, deteriorates.</p>
