          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 22:42:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicates that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's contraction. This result contrasts with the official PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, though the two surveys use different sample sizes and methodologies. The Caixin data suggests a potential recovery driven by export orders, as businesses may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has requested that some of the California National Guard forces deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration be reassigned to help combat wildfires. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 troops to prepare for what is expected to be an "early and active" fire season. The initial deployment to L.A. to address protests was controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who had warned it could impede the state's wildfire response capabilities. This potential shift highlights the competing demands for National Guard resources in California.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a key messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. It achieves this by targeting and inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of exercise and could inform future anti-aging strategies that simulate its effects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by backing companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas. He suggests these investors are less interested in traditional metrics like stock buybacks and are instead rewarding companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir for their innovative approaches. This has created what Cramer calls an "idea market" or a "story-dominated market," where the potential for future growth and disruption is valued highly. He argues this focus on individual company narratives is overshadowing broader macroeconomic concerns like Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Jassy also discussed artificial intelligence, calling it the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and confirming it will lead to workforce reductions in some automated roles.

However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to drop substantially further and remain hundreds of pounds above pre-pandemic levels. With significant uncertainty in global markets, there are concerns that bills could rise again heading into the winter.
