          <p>Global private-equity firm KKR has strengthened its partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) by acquiring a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets. This article reports that the subsidiary operates 38 gas pipelines and two export terminals in the UAE, with KKR not disclosing the deal's value. This investment follows a 2019 oil pipelines deal with KKR and BlackRock, which facilitated foreign direct investment in the region. KKR's move expands its 16-year presence in the Middle East, with the firm now managing over $90 billion in infrastructure assets globally, underscoring its commitment to the region's growing opportunities.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks during a government shutdown, as these payments are covered by mandatory spending, this article confirms. However, other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, whose working budget requires congressional approval, could face disruptions. These include benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the replacement of Medicare cards, as roughly 6,200 SSA workers are expected to be furloughed. A potential delay in the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement is also possible if the Labor Department's CPI data release is affected, highlighting potential inconveniences despite core benefits remaining secure.</p>

          <p>China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has finalized a US$1.4 billion deal to revitalize the Tazara Railway, significantly expanding China's access to Africa's Copperbelt region. This article reports that the investment includes an initial US$1.1 billion for track rehabilitation and upgrades to workshops, with an additional US$238 million reinvestment. The 1,860km line connects Zambia’s Copperbelt to Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam port, offering a crucial alternative for copper and cobalt shipments to the Indian Ocean. This strategic move positions Tazara ahead of competing US-backed and Japan-supported routes, enhancing China's influence in key African trading corridors and securing vital mineral resources.</p>

This article notes that the statement, published on the State Department’s website, wished China health, happiness, prosperity, and peace. While the US traditionally extends such greetings, last year's message from then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken was notably delayed, posted after the actual National Day amidst heightened tensions between the two nations. This year's timely message suggests a potential diplomatic nuance or effort to maintain communication despite ongoing geopolitical complexities.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly nearing a $10 billion deal to acquire Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, potentially marking its largest acquisition in three years. This article from the Wall Street Journal indicates the deal could finalize within days, coming as Berkshire Hathaway holds a record $344 billion cash reserve. The move aligns with the energy expertise of Greg Abel, Buffett's successor as CEO, who will remain chairman after stepping down at the end of 2025. Berkshire already owns a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental, having previously bankrolled a major acquisition in 2019. This potential deal would further deepen Berkshire's involvement in the energy sector and leverage its substantial cash reserves.</p>

The Thacker Pass mine is poised to become one of North America's largest lithium sources, with operations expected to begin in late 2027.

          <p>Steve Coogan discusses the enduring appeal and evolution of his beloved comedy character, Alan Partridge, who returns in a new TV documentary exploring mental health. This article highlights Coogan's intention to "laugh around mental health, not at it," using Partridge as a comedic "Trojan horse" to address taboo subjects. The character, now more "three-dimensional," finds himself investigating his own mental health after a stint in Saudi Arabia. Coogan explains that Partridge's longevity stems from his ability to mock various societal viewpoints and his increasing pathos, resonating with both older fans and younger audiences who see their parents' desperation to remain relevant.</p>

          <p>UCLA offensive coordinator Tino Sunseri has mutually parted ways with the team after a disappointing start to the season, where the Bruins' offense ranked among the worst in the nation. This article reports that tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel will take over as offensive playcaller, with former UCLA offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone expected to assume analyst responsibilities. Sunseri's hiring was initially seen as a coup, but the offense averaged only 14.2 points and 321.2 yards per game, leading to a 0-4 record. The change aims to revitalize the team's struggling performance, particularly for quarterback Nico Iamaleava, as they prepare to face No. 7 Penn State.</p>
