          <p>The LA Galaxy secured their first victory of the 2025 MLS season, defeating Real Salt Lake 2-0 at Dignity Health Sports Park, with goals from Lucas Sanabria and Joseph Paintsil. This win provides a respite for the defending league champions, who had endured a 16-game winless streak, marking one of the worst starts in club history. Despite the victory, coach Greg Vanney acknowledges that the team's performance has been challenging, but he commended the players' resilience and commitment throughout the match. While the win offers a temporary reprieve, it may be a mirage given RSL's own struggles, having gone six games without a win prior to this match.</p>

          <p>Investors are showing a preference for short-term Treasury bills, with maturities on the shorter end of the fixed-income market, due to concerns about economic volatility. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are attracting significant investor flows, with SGOV only being surpassed by Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) in new assets. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also increased its holdings of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This trend suggests a cautious approach among investors, favoring stability and liquidity over longer-term investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>George Russell criticized Max Verstappen's driving following a collision during the final laps of the Spanish Grand Prix, stating that Verstappen "let himself down." The incident occurred after a late safety car restart, where Verstappen, on fresh hard tires, struggled for grip and made contact with both Charles Leclerc and Russell. Verstappen accused Russell of pushing him off the track, but stewards ultimately took no action against either driver. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted that the team's tire strategy may have been a misjudgment. The stewards took no further action over the incident with Leclerc on the straight because "both cars were moving slightly towards each other in the middle of the track and a minor collision occurred as a result."</p>
