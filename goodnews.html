        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Jets have reportedly secured a landmark deal with cornerback Sauce Gardner, making him the highest-paid player at his position in NFL history. The four-year, $120.4 million extension includes $60 million in guaranteed money and will keep the 24-year-old star with the team through the 2030 season. This contract follows another major deal for the Jets, who recently signed receiver Garrett Wilson to a large extension. Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro, confirmed the agreement on social media, solidifying his role as a cornerstone of the team's defense.</p>

          <p>At a summit hosted at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to build a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's energy resources, with plans including the construction of new data centers and an energy innovation training hub. The event, attended by numerous cabinet members and industry leaders, highlighted a vision for regional economic revitalization through the convergence of technology and energy. However, the summit also drew protests from activists concerned about its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has called on the financial industry to adopt a more positive narrative about investing in stocks and shares to help stimulate economic growth. In a key speech, she argued that the focus has been too heavily on risks rather than potential benefits, which has deterred savers. The government is now working with the Financial Conduct Authority to create a new system of targeted support for would-be investors. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to encourage the public to shift funds from cash savings accounts into investments that support UK companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon is turning to its direct competitor, Elon Musk's SpaceX, to launch the next 24 satellites for its Project Kuiper internet constellation. This move highlights the immense pressure Amazon faces to deploy its network, as it is required by the FCC to have approximately 1,600 satellites in orbit by mid-2026. While SpaceX's Starlink currently dominates the satellite internet market, Amazon is investing over $10 billion in Kuiper to compete. This launch is one of three that Amazon has booked with SpaceX, demonstrating the critical need for reliable launch capacity in the competitive space industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Kallas stated that if Europe is footing the bill, it is European support, and urged the U.S. to "share the burden" of arming Ukraine.
