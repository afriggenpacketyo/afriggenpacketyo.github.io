          <h2>Strategies for Managing 'Energy Vampire' Friendships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:36:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "energy vampires" in friendships, referring to individuals who consistently drain one's emotional and mental energy through behaviors like constant complaining or self-centered conversation. Psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani identify common signs, including an excessive need for attention and reassurance, or slowly eroding one's mood with backhanded compliments. The article suggests three strategies for managing such relationships: initiating honest conversations about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries if the friend is unwilling to change, and altering shared activities to shift focus away from purely conversational dominance. These approaches aim to protect one's well-being and maintain healthier interpersonal dynamics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:30:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to significantly expand its use of green marine fuels, particularly methanol, is critically dependent on establishing a robust supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, methanol requires a streamlined, tax-free supply from mainland China for storage and sale in Hong Kong. This article highlights the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large dual-fuel vehicle carrier, which currently operates with one-quarter green methanol. Wang anticipates a gradual increase in green methanol usage from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, despite the fuel's current cost being four times higher than traditional options.

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, secured a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in an election critical for the country's path to the EU. The election was marred by Sandu's warnings of "massive Russian interference," including reported bomb scares at polling stations and arrests related to alleged plots to incite unrest. Despite pre-emptive victory claims by pro-Russian opposition leaders and accusations of voter harassment, Sandu's party achieved nearly 50% of the vote. This outcome reinforces Moldova's commitment to European integration amidst ongoing geopolitical pressures from Russia, its breakaway region of Transnistria, and internal challenges like corruption and spiraling prices.</p>

          <p>Team Europe clinched a 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, New York, retaining the trophy despite a sensational American comeback attempt on the final day. Europe had established a record seven-point lead after two days, but the U.S. fought fiercely in the singles matches, matching a Ryder Cup record by winning 8.5 points on Sunday. Tyrrell Hatton secured the outright winning half-point, with Shane Lowry's crucial birdie putt ensuring Europe would at least retain the trophy. Captain Luke Donald became the second European captain to win home and away matches, cementing Europe's dominance in a hostile away environment.</p>

          <p>Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), transformed the mixed martial arts league from an unprofitable, largely unsanctioned venture into a global phenomenon now valued at over $15 billion. White, who initially acquired a 10% stake when two friends bought the struggling UFC for $2 million, achieved this through a combination of risk-taking, a forceful personality, and strategic moves like the "The Ultimate Fighter" reality series. The article highlights his early struggles to find venues, eventually hosted by Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal. White's business acumen led to a $4 billion sale in 2016 and a recent $7.7 billion media rights deal, positioning UFC among major sports leagues and even planning a future fight at the White House.</p>

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its picturesque windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to control the overwhelming number of tourists, which reached 2.6 million last year for a resident population of only 100. Residents report a significant loss of privacy, with tourists entering gardens, peeking into houses, and even using selfie sticks. While the fee will include admission to the museum and inside the windmills, some local shop and restaurant owners fear a substantial loss of business from budget-conscious visitors. This article highlights a growing challenge for popular tourist destinations balancing preservation, resident quality of life, and economic interests.</p>

          <p>The kārearea, New Zealand's native falcon, has been crowned Bird of the Year in an annual election known for its fierce campaigning and widespread public engagement. This majestic raptor, capable of flying over 200 km/h, is an endemic species threatened by electrocution on wires and loss of its forest habitats, with only an estimated 5,000-8,000 remaining. The contest, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, draws attention to the country's unique and vulnerable bird species, 80% of which are designated as being in trouble to some degree. Despite its lighthearted nature, featuring meme battles and trash-talking, the poll serves a serious conservation message in a nation where birds hold significant cultural importance.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, concluded his illustrious 18-year regular season career with a dominant performance, striking out seven over 5 ⅓ scoreless innings in the Dodgers' 6-1 win over the Mariners. This final outing, marked by his 3,052nd career strikeout and a career ERA of 2.53—the best among starting pitchers with 1,000 innings in the live ball era—culminated in an emotional farewell from the mound. Manager Dave Roberts had teammate Freddie Freeman remove Kershaw, who kept the game ball. Despite his strong finish, Kershaw will not be on the Dodgers' roster for the upcoming NL Wild Card Series, though he remains open to pitching in later postseason rounds if the team advances.</p>

These include the Reds' unexpected late-season surge, their veteran manager Terry Francona, and dangerous young players like Elly De La Cruz, who leads the team in several offensive categories. The Reds' strong starting pitching, particularly Hunter Greene, and a reliable closer, Emilio Pagán, also pose significant threats.
