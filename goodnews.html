In a public letter, Tan stated he is engaging with the administration to correct misinformation and defended his record, asserting he has always operated with the highest legal and ethical standards. The accusations were amplified by Senator Tom Cotton, but Tan affirmed he has the full support of Intel's board and remains committed to advancing U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's predictable four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" events, may be breaking down, according to market analysts. The recent U.S. approval of spot bitcoin ETFs has introduced significant institutional investment, altering traditional market dynamics and causing bitcoin to hit a new all-time high before the last halving, rather than after. Experts suggest that these new institutional flows, combined with a more supportive regulatory environment, could lead to less extreme price volatility and a departure from the historical boom-and-bust pattern.

          <p>For individuals struggling with debt for whom a consolidation loan is not a feasible option, several alternative strategies can provide relief. This article outlines practical steps such as contacting creditors directly to negotiate lower interest rates or extended repayment terms. Other options include working with a debt settlement company to reduce the total amount owed, using a 0% APR balance transfer credit card to pause interest charges, or seeking guidance from a nonprofit credit counseling agency to create a structured debt management plan.</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the most detailed picture yet of 3I-Atlas, an interstellar comet currently passing through our solar system. This is only the third known interstellar object to be discovered, and it poses no threat to Earth. Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet has an icy core estimated to be no more than 3.5 miles wide. The new image reveals a distinct teardrop-shaped cloud of dust around its nucleus and a faint dusty tail as it continues its journey through space.</p>

          <p>An archaeological team from East Carolina University has potentially discovered the wreck of "La Fortuna," a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a colonial North Carolina port in 1748. Found at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, the remains are one of four shipwrecks recently uncovered in the area. Analysis of wood samples suggests the ship was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon believed to be from the vessel was recovered in 1985.</p>

This strategy is maintained as OpenAI is reportedly in discussions for a new stock sale that could value the company at approximately $500 billion, freeing it from public market pressures.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has announced it will no longer feature "Visit Rwanda" in a commercial sponsorship capacity, following months of criticism. The partnership drew condemnation due to allegations of Rwanda's support for a rebel group in the neighboring DR Congo. The club stated the relationship will now transition to focus solely on football development through its youth academy in Kigali. This move distances the club from promoting tourism for the Rwandan government while maintaining a presence in the country.</p>

          <p>The bidding war for UK healthcare landlord Assura has escalated as the country's competition watchdog investigates its proposed £1.7bn takeover by rival Primary Health Properties (PHP). The probe is examining whether the deal would reduce competition. Meanwhile, U.S. private equity firm KKR is actively lobbying Assura's board to accept its competing £1.696bn cash offer, arguing that its bid presents no regulatory hurdles. The situation creates uncertainty for the FTSE 250-listed company, which owns over 600 medical properties across the UK. (not investment advice)</p>
