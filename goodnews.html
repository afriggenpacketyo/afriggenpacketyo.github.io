          <p>In a remarkable medical case, surgeons at Shanghai Changzheng Hospital have saved a patient whose head was nearly severed in an industrial accident involving a robotic arm. The patient suffered severed cervical vertebrae and damaged neurovascular structures but miraculously had an intact spinal cord, which allowed for the life-saving procedure. The accident caused instant paralysis, a heart attack, and severe bleeding, requiring extensive medical intervention to stabilize the patient. Doctors noted the unprecedented severity of the injury and the subsequent successful treatment, stating they had never encountered a comparable case of survival.</p>

          <p>Famed director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a multi-city tour to build a fan base for his critically panned and commercially unsuccessful 2024 film, 'Megalopolis.' At these events, the 86-year-old filmmaker engages in lengthy, unmoderated discussions on broad themes like time, money, and politics, which he loosely connects to his movie. This effort is seen as an unusual attempt by a creator to personally facilitate a cult following for their work, rather than allowing one to develop organically over time. While the tour has drawn crowds, it remains unclear if it will successfully revive the film's legacy.</p>

In his announcement, Brown stated he feels compelled to run again to make a difference for Ohioans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipping container data shows that major retailers like Walmart and Target engaged in a "front-loading" strategy, accelerating U.S. imports of popular goods to get ahead of potential tariffs. Items ranging from holiday decorations and toys like Barbies and Squishmallows to air fryers were shipped earlier than usual. This strategic move aimed to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs and avoid potential supply chain disruptions. The data highlights the complex logistical decisions retailers must make in response to volatile trade policies, which can lead to increased short-term freight costs but provide greater predictability.

The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel.

          <p>During his recent summit with President Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted a new Ural motorcycle to a local resident named Mark Warren. The gift was arranged after Russian state television reporters met Warren by chance and he mentioned his difficulty in obtaining spare parts for his old Ural bike. An employee from the Russian embassy presented the new motorcycle to a speechless Warren, who described the gift as a personal one from the Russian president. The gesture served as a unique human-interest moment during the high-stakes diplomatic event.</p>

          <p>A delegation of European leaders is meeting with President Trump in Washington with three primary goals to support Ukraine. First, they seek to secure robust, NATO-like security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future aggression. Second, they aim to emphasize the need to stop the ongoing violence before any permanent peace deal is brokered, maintaining economic pressure on Russia. Finally, the European contingent wants to ensure that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is included in any future high-level negotiations, advocating for a trilateral meeting between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Abbott Laboratories' financial health indicates the company maintains a very conservative and manageable level of debt. The medical equipment firm's net debt is only 0.54 times its EBITDA, and its earnings cover interest expenses over 42 times, suggesting a strong ability to meet its obligations. Furthermore, the company demonstrated robust growth with a 15% increase in earnings before interest and taxes last year and has shown strong conversion of those earnings into free cash flow, reinforcing its prudent financial position.

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, many of which originated from internet culture and social media. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a gibberish term from a viral YouTube series, and "tradwife," a shorthand for a traditional wife who documents her domestic life online. Other additions reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device to feign activity while working remotely, and "broligarchy," describing powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting power in the English language.</p>
