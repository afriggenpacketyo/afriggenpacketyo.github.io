          <p>The National Portrait Gallery has launched an immersive exhibition in Salford, combining digital versions of portraits with animated graphics and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 British icons, ranging from Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse. The exhibition, titled 'Stories Brought To Life,' aims to reach new audiences outside of London and generate revenue for the gallery. While the original portraits are free to view in London, tickets for the immersive experience cost up to £35, raising concerns about accessibility. A separate immersive experience featuring the works of LS Lowry is also available in Salford, animating his famous matchstick men painting.</p>

The group, comprised of cousins aged 14 to 22, achieved the feat by successfully executing the difficult quadruple somersault three times during the competition. Celebrities such as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Becky G have attended their shows in Los Angeles, where they are currently performing. The family-run circus, which has a long history in Mexico, is now preparing to participate in festivals in Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman's Worldcoin, an eye-scanning venture aiming to create a global identity verification system, has officially launched in the U.S. with six retail locations. The project scans irises to create a unique "IrisCode," verifying users as human and providing them with cryptocurrency and a World ID for integrated platforms. Worldcoin has partnered with Visa to introduce the "World Visa card" and is piloting age verification tools with Tinder in Japan. The company plans to deploy 7,500 orbs by the end of the year and open an assembly line in Texas, despite some concerns from governments regarding data storage and privacy.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border remained at historically low levels in April, marking three months into President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, consistent with the previous two months and the lowest tallies since fiscal year 2000. The Trump administration attributes the drop to its strict immigration policies, including rapid deportations and increased troop deployment. However, some experts note that migration patterns can change rapidly, and migration to the southern border began dropping last year.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as it was moved to Germany's Black Forest to be monitored. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme, the cat from Newquay Zoo was requested. The lynx will spend the next few months in an enclosure to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. If successful, the lynx will help increase genetic diversity in central Europe and contribute to the reintroduction of the species.</p>

          <p>Apple's second-quarter financials surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue of $95.4bn and earnings-per-share of $1.65. However, CEO Tim Cook anticipates $900m in costs for the upcoming quarter due to tariffs. Despite this, Cook remained positive, highlighting the company's strong quarterly results. Apple is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, but is shifting production to India and Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts. The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading, likely due to the tariff news and missed expectations for its services division revenue.</p>
