          <p>China is bracing for a significant travel boom during its upcoming "super golden week," an extended holiday from October 1-8 combining the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day. Travel marketing and technology company China Trading Desk predicts between 8 million and 8.4 million trips outside mainland China, a substantial increase from the previous year, fueled by demand for visa-free destinations like Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The longer break allows individuals to strategically combine annual leave, fostering a strong resurgence in both domestic and international tourism and indicating robust consumer confidence. This article highlights the economic implications of renewed travel and the strategic efforts to boost the tourism sector after recent global disruptions.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines, currently navigating its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in under a year, has secured a crucial lifeline of up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing from debtholders, along with an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor. This financing, pending court approval, is vital for the struggling budget carrier's revitalization efforts, which include rejecting leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases as it aggressively cuts costs. Spirit's restructuring lawyer noted "massive progress" in court, while CEO Dave Davis expressed optimism that these significant steps will build a stronger airline. Despite competitor skepticism about its survival, the company is determined to secure its future with high-value travel options.</p>

Park officials celebrated his determination and adaptability, noting his permanent disability but strong likelihood of surviving another winter.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts, William Young, issued a scathing 161-page decision, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. The judge criticized the Trump administration's actions as a "truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech," aimed at chilling lawful expression on college campuses. He condemned the use of masked agents for detentions, calling it "disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable," and accused officials of acting with "invidious" intent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Catastrophe bonds are gaining traction as a financial tool to help make insurance more affordable, especially in disaster-prone areas like Oak Island, North Carolina. These bonds, typically purchased by institutional investors, pay out to insurance companies only if a natural disaster meets specific thresholds. If no disaster occurs, investors receive a return. This mechanism provides insurers with crucial capital for claims and offers investors non-correlated market returns. Some bonds are innovatively structured to fund weather resilience upgrades, like fortified roofs, which can significantly reduce future losses. This article explores how these bonds benefit both insurers and homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

Body camera footage showed deputies pulling guns on Porter before slamming her to the pavement, with her father also briefly detained. She was jailed overnight but never charged. This settlement, described as one of California's largest for its type, highlights accountability issues within law enforcement and the ongoing struggle for civil rights and justice.</p>
