          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is prepared to leave office once Russia's war on Ukraine concludes, emphasizing that his primary goal is to achieve peace rather than secure another term. In an interview, he affirmed his willingness to hold elections in Ukraine during a potential ceasefire period. These remarks come as Ukraine remains under martial law, which currently prohibits elections. Zelenskyy, whose five-year term would have ended in May 2024, has been in office for over six years due to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, predicts that artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a "super cycle" that could span 15 to 20 years, profoundly transforming various global sectors, including drug development and the job market. He highlights the resurgence of Silicon Valley and the empowerment of sole founders through AI tools. While acknowledging the current market's "frothiness" and potential overvaluation, Ganguly believes the next decade will focus on "deep" tech beyond consumer applications, reshaping industries less touched by technology. He also identifies India as a significant market for AI-native app development. (not investment advice)</p>

The bridge rises 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below, comparable to the height of the Shanghai Tower, and surpasses the previous record holder, the Duge Bridge. Spanning the Huajiang Grand Canyon, known as the "Earth's crack," this impressive engineering feat will also become the world's longest mountain bridge with a total length of 2,890 meters. Guizhou province is already home to nearly half of the world's 100 tallest bridges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged the illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books to train its chatbots. The settlement, which pays approximately $3,000 per covered book, aims to resolve claims about how certain materials were obtained, though the court's earlier ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. Both the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild lauded the agreement as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for copyright infringement and encouraging legal licensing.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Seeks to Regulate Loud Streaming Ads, Potentially Impacting National Standards</h2>

          <p>A California Senate Bill, inspired by a baby woken by a loud commercial, aims to prevent streaming services from broadcasting ads at excessive volumes. Introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, SB 576 seeks to extend federal regulations, currently applicable only to traditional TV, to platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. Given California's significant market influence, the bill could set a de facto national standard if signed into law. While it passed the Senate, the Motion Picture Association is lobbying against it, arguing about the complexity of managing ad volumes from diverse sources. The bill is now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's decision.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home and are recovering at the New York Aquarium. Trading in coral is highly restricted due to their protected status under international conservation agreements. The aquarium, acting as a "coral hospital," rehabilitated the corals which were in poor health after five days in transit. Many have since recovered sufficiently to be moved to public display, serving as ambassadors for their species and educating visitors on the importance of marine conservation.</p>

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel is causing alarm in a California town, attacking several residents and sending at least two to the emergency room with bites and scratches. The attacks in San Rafael's Lucas Valley neighborhood have prompted warnings to residents, with one victim describing being "body slammed" by the animal. Experts from Marin Humane suggest that such rare aggression typically stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, causing animals to lose their natural fear and become aggressive when not fed. This incident serves as a reminder against interacting with wild animals for public safety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is exploring diverse options for its Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS), including converting business jets into aerial refueling tankers. This initiative aims to address evolving anti-air threats and the need for greater flexibility in contested environments, potentially allowing for operations from shorter runways with reduced logistical demands. While business jet-based tankers would have less fuel capacity than current models, they could support routine missions and free up larger tankers for more demanding operations. The Air Force is also refining cost estimates for stealthy tanker designs, emphasizing survivability in future conflicts.</p>

Ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee plenum, where the next five-year plan will be discussed, Yang emphasized the need to increase household disposable income's share of national income and consumer spending's share of total demand. His comments highlight a strategic shift towards strengthening domestic consumption as a key pillar for future economic expansion and stability.</p>
