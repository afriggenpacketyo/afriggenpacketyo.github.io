          <p>Following two days of tariff talks in Geneva, the White House announced a trade deal with China, although details remain unclear. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng stated that substantial progress was made, and an important consensus was reached, including establishing a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues. Both sides emphasized the importance of equal-footed dialogue to resolve differences and avoid a trade war, with China stating its commitment to win-win outcomes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed productive talks and promised a complete briefing on Monday, indicating a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Zepbound Shows Superior Weight Loss Compared to Wegovy in Clinical Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 18:01:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head clinical trial revealed that Eli Lilly's Zepbound resulted in significantly more weight loss than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy among overweight or obese participants. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Zepbound users lost nearly 50% more weight on average over 72 weeks. While both drugs improve health markers and have similar side effects, Zepbound's dual hormone targeting may explain its greater efficacy. Access and affordability remain challenges, as CVS Health recently favored Wegovy on its standard formulary, highlighting the importance of having multiple treatment options for obesity.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, though the matter remains under legal review. While reports suggest the plane could be transferred to the Trump presidential library, Qatar's media attach√© disputes claims of an imminent gift during Trump's upcoming trip. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres has called for an ethics review of the potential gift, raising concerns about violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed that any accepted gift would comply with applicable laws and ensure full transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he will use as Air Force One, raising questions about the legality of the move. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move. The administration will retrofit the plane so it can be used in Trump's official capacity as president. The plane, a Boeing 747-8 jet, is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term, two sources confirmed to NBC.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, analysts provided mixed reactions, with some emphasizing the positive headlines but cautioning against excessive optimism. Christopher Hodge of Natixis noted that while a de-escalation was inevitable, lasting changes were unlikely, and tariffs would remain high. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital viewed the news as slightly better than expected but awaited more details before making investment decisions. Eric Kuby of North Star Investment Management Corp. saw it as a step in the right direction, showing both sides' interest in a constructive conclusion.</p>
