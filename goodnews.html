          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have finalized a comprehensive agreement aimed at resetting their relationship following Brexit. The deal encompasses various sectors including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with officials from both sides hailing it as a new chapter after years of tense relations. The agreement seeks to reduce bureaucratic obstacles for British businesses, facilitate food and drink exports, and extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038. British travelers will also benefit from the use of eGates at EU airports, reducing passport control queues, though some issues like youth mobility schemes remain under discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and the EU are pursuing deeper cooperation, marking a significant shift since Brexit, with agreements focusing on fisheries, trade, and security. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting EU leaders in London to finalize these deals, which aim to reduce red tape and boost the British economy. A key agreement allows EU fishermen access to British waters for 12 years in exchange for the EU easing customs checks on food and plant products, potentially adding billions to the UK economy. This summit underscores Starmer's commitment to resetting EU-UK relations and fostering formal cross-channel integration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer's approach to the UK's relationship with the EU hinges on the belief that the public is no longer deeply invested in the intricacies of Brexit. While a new UK-EU deal has been reached, Starmer aims to portray it as a pragmatic and uncontroversial step to smooth relations. The Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender," particularly regarding fishing quotas and agricultural rules, while the Liberal Democrats advocate for rejoining the EU's customs union. The success of Starmer's strategy depends on whether opposition parties campaign heavily on these issues, indicating ongoing public controversy over Brexit.</p>
