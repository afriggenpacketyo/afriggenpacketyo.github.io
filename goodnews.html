          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting a tsunami warning for areas within 185 miles of the epicenter. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for coastal regions, including the Strait of Magellan and nearby Antarctic areas. President Boric assured that all resources were available to respond to the situation, urging residents to heed the authorities. In Ushuaia, Argentina, water activities were suspended, while in Punta Arenas, Chile, residents evacuated calmly to shelters, and no immediate reports of damage or casualties were reported.</p>

          <p>A trade loophole allowing duty-free entry of low-value packages into the U.S. expired on May 2, potentially increasing prices for consumers. Retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on the de minimis exemption for packages under $800, are expected to raise prices. President Trump eliminated the exemption due to concerns about fentanyl entering the U.S. through this channel, and retailers are already adding tariff surcharges to orders. The end of the loophole could also cause delays in shipments and benefit companies selling goods made in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Arsenal midfielder Jorginho is "recovering well" from a lung injury and may feature again this season, according to manager Mikel Arteta. Jorginho's last appearance was on April 12, and sources indicate he suffered a punctured lung. Kai Havertz, who underwent hamstring surgery, is also progressing and expected to play before the end of the season. The potential return of both players would boost Arsenal, especially if they reach the Champions League final.</p>

          <p>Brown University is under scrutiny after a student, Alex Shieh, sent an email to non-faculty employees asking what they do all day, mirroring Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Rep. Troy Nehls has urged the university to reconsider disciplinary action against Shieh, arguing it infringes on open inquiry. Nehls has also demanded information on how Brown uses its $7.2 billion endowment to lower tuition. A Brown University official stated that the review focuses on improper use of data and targeting of employees, not free speech.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing the university's alleged failure to protect Jewish students on campus. The administration had previously sent Harvard a list of demands and froze over $2.2 billion in federal funding after Harvard rejected those demands, calling them illegal. Harvard's president argued that the demands were an attempt to dictate what private universities can teach and who they can admit.

Experts suggest the FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain in favor, with potential for further gains if the Bank of England cuts interest rates.
