        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without resorting to sick leave. The move has been praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass and MPs, who see it as a significant step in legally recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement rather than a medical issue.</p>

          <p>Former multiple world boxing champion Ricky Hatton has announced he will return to the sport, 13 years after his retirement. At 46, Hatton is scheduled to fight Eisa Al Dah of the UAE in a middleweight match on December 2 in Dubai. The announcement was made during a promotional event in Dubai, with Hatton confirming his comeback via a livestream. He explained his absence from the event was due to a minor, non-permanent eye injury caused by his sunglasses. Hatton, who previously held titles at welterweight and light-welterweight, expressed his excitement for the upcoming fight.</p>

          <p>As Denmark assumes the six-month presidency of the EU Council, it aims to reinvigorate the bloc's green agenda amidst shifting geopolitical priorities. With issues like the war in Ukraine and economic competition taking precedence, ambitious climate policies have faced a backlash. Danish officials are reframing the green transition as essential for Europe's strategic autonomy and defense, arguing that reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports enhances security. However, this approach faces challenges, as some EU member states, including Poland and Italy, express concerns that ambitious emissions targets could hinder economic development.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of high-level academic papers has found that individuals of Chinese origin dominate the list of the world's top 100 artificial intelligence experts. According to the report, 65 of the leading AI scientists are of Chinese descent. Of these, 50 are currently employed at research institutions or companies within China. The remaining 15 work abroad, with 10 based at U.S. institutions. The study reviewed over 96,000 papers from top-tier journals and conferences between 2015 and 2024, assessing scientists' impact based on their publication and citation counts.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence semiconductor startup Groq has announced its expansion into Europe with a new data center in Helsinki, Finland, established in partnership with Equinix. The company, a competitor to Nvidia, designs specialized chips called Language Processing Units (LPUs) optimized for AI inferencing. CEO Jonathan Ross highlighted that Groq's technology avoids the supply-limited, high-cost components used by rivals, positioning the company to handle high-volume, lower-margin inference tasks. This strategic move aims to capitalize on rising European demand for AI services and the push for sovereign AI capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old from London, has been released from a Dubai prison and has returned to the UK after receiving a royal pardon. He was sentenced to a year in prison in December for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old British girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The campaign group Detained in Dubai, which advocated for his release, stated that the pardon was granted by Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The UK's Foreign Office confirmed his release and return, noting he wished to reunite with his family privately.</p>

          <p>The taste of chocolate varies significantly worldwide due to differing consumer preferences, production methods, and regulations. In the United States, chocolate often has a longer shelf life and a distinctively sweet, slightly sour taste due to the use of butyric acid, a flavor profile that can be jarring to European palates. Conversely, European chocolate, particularly in countries like Switzerland and Belgium, is governed by stricter EU rules requiring higher cocoa content and is known for its fine, creamy texture. Meanwhile, emerging markets in India and Africa are developing their own unique chocolate cultures and flavor preferences.</p>

          <p>A bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China has lifted a ban on the sale of American jet engine components, a move expected to ensure the continued production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. The deal allows the state-owned manufacturer Comac to import critical parts from a GE-affiliated joint venture, which is essential for fulfilling hundreds of existing orders for the narrowbody jet. Analysts note that while this secures the C919's production line for now, the previous U.S. restrictions have likely reinforced Beijing's determination to accelerate the development of its own domestic engine technology to reduce future reliance.

          <p>Hopes for a new Gaza ceasefire are growing as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with U.S. President Donald Trump. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Qatar over a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. President Trump has expressed confidence a deal could be reached this week. The diplomatic push comes after a recent 12-day war between Israel and Iran, which analysts believe has shifted regional dynamics and may make both Israel and Hamas more amenable to an agreement. However, significant obstacles remain, and both Palestinians and Israeli hostage families express only cautious optimism.</p>

          <p>Jason Chapman, a world-renowned British ecologist specializing in insect migration, has taken a full-time position at Nanjing Agricultural University in China. His move highlights China's growing prominence in the natural sciences and its investment in advanced research technology. Chapman was particularly drawn by the country's cutting-edge radar entomology program, which uses sophisticated radar to track flying insects, a field in which China is now considered a world leader. His research focuses on the evolution of insect migration and its ecological impact, a critical area for understanding biodiversity and agricultural patterns.</p>

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, according to new research. In a clinical trial, a single injection of a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear significantly improved hearing in all 10 participants, who had hearing loss caused by a deficiency of the protein otoferlin. The effects were rapid, with noticeable improvement within a month. One seven-year-old girl regained almost full hearing. The treatment, which was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offers hope that similar therapies could be developed for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>
