          <p>Senator Rand Paul has condemned the Trump administration's $8.9 billion investment for a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, labeling the move "a step towards socialism." Paul argued against government intervention in the free market, expressing concern that the Republican party is diminishing its free-market principles. The investment is one of several instances of the administration taking direct stakes in private companies, a policy that has found unusual support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders.

          <p>Federal officials have intercepted a massive shipment of precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, which originated from China and was destined for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. The seizure involved 1,300 barrels containing chemicals capable of producing over 420,000 pounds of methamphetamine, with an estimated street value exceeding $569 million. This operation highlights a strategy focused on disrupting the drug supply chain at its source rather than targeting the finished product.</p>

Because mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors, including the 10-year Treasury yield, borrowers could see relief sooner than the formal policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly crossed the 5% threshold before retreating, following the release of a jobs report that showed fewer openings than economists had predicted. The weaker labor data suggested a cooling economy, causing bond yields to fall as investors recalibrated expectations for future Federal Reserve policy. The market volatility was also influenced by uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newsmax has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, claiming the media giant has illegally used its monopoly power to stifle competition in the right-leaning news market.
