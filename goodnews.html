          <p>A peace deal facilitated by the Trump administration has resulted in the release of hostages held by Hamas, leading to emotional reunions with their families in Israel. The article highlights the personal stories of several freed individuals, including a father of two and twin brothers who were separated during their abduction. This development is a significant part of a broader 20-point peace plan, though many elements of the agreement have yet to be implemented. For now, the successful hostage release has brought a moment of relief and celebration for the affected families.</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas were returned to Israel in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, stating that Hamas would be disarmed, by force if necessary. The agreement has also facilitated the return of the remains of some deceased hostages and Palestinian bodies held by Israel. This marks the first major step in a fragile peace process, allowing some residents of the devastated Gaza Strip to begin returning home.</p>

          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, this article examines the current landscape for high-yield savings accounts. While the peak rates of over 5% are now rare, savers can still find competitive rates in the 4.20% to 4.30% range, particularly with online banks. These accounts remain significantly more profitable than traditional savings accounts, which average just 0.40% interest. Unlike CDs, they also offer the key benefit of liquidity, allowing savers to access their funds without penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the new Gaza peace agreement, arguing that its greatest strength—the deliberate vagueness that allowed for a swift ceasefire and hostage release—is also its greatest weakness. By postponing difficult questions about Hamas's disarmament, Israeli troop withdrawal, and the future governance of Gaza, the deal secured immediate progress. However, this ambiguity leaves the long-term stability of the region uncertain, creating an opening for peace that could close quickly if foundational issues are not addressed.</p>
