          <p>The article reports that MPs in England and Wales are debating a bill to legalize assisted dying, marking the first such debate after significant changes were made to the proposed legislation. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, has undergone six months of scrutiny and amendments, including the removal of the need for a High Court judge to approve each request. The government has also quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647. The debate includes considerations for safeguards and palliative care, with MPs given a free vote on the matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and United Arab Emirates are collaborating to enable Abu Dhabi to acquire advanced American-made semiconductors for its AI development. The agreement could involve the UAE importing 500,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips annually, boosting its AI infrastructure and data center capabilities. This move comes as the Trump administration plans to potentially roll back the Biden era ‚ÄúAI diffusion rule,‚Äù which had restricted the export of advanced AI chips, even to friendly nations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors moved away from U.S. markets following President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest that Trump's tariff policies altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, prompting diversification into markets like Japan, considered a safe haven. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the initial shift highlights the impact of trade uncertainties on global asset allocation.</p>

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its factories worldwide with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a business restructuring plan. The Japanese car manufacturer, which has a significant presence in the UK, is undergoing changes that include laying off 11,000 workers and closing seven factories. Nissan's willingness to strengthen ties with Dongfeng coincides with ongoing discussions about the UK's trade relationship with China, particularly concerning supply chain security. Despite these global shifts, Nissan has stated that there are no current plans to alter operations at its Sunderland plant in the UK.</p>

Unlike regular tournaments where preferred lies are permitted, major championships like the PGA often leave the decision to implement this rule to the discretion of tournament organizers. The presence of mud on the ball can cause unpredictable spins and affect the overall performance of golfers, adding an element of chance to the game.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas through an extensive genetic analysis. The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups. This research, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>
