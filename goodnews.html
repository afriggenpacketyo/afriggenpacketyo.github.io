          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Korea's last and oldest circus, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon was a major form of entertainment during the 1960s, but the rise of television, movies, and the internet led to declining audiences. The circus has adapted by dropping animal acts and focusing on acrobatic performances, and all 35 acrobats are now Chinese due to a lack of South Koreans pursuing the profession. Head Park Sae-hwan hopes to establish a circus school to cultivate South Korean talent and ensure the circus's survival for another century. There is hope that the circus will be able to survive and continue to delight audiences for years to come.</p>

Sanders is competing against three other quarterbacks for the Browns‚Äô starting position for the 2025 season. The incident does not necessarily affect the team's overall outlook, but it does reflect negatively on Sanders' judgement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, during a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, jokingly questioned the immigration status of the construction workers. After discussing his administration's deportation efforts, Trump turned to the workers and asked if there were any "illegal immigrants" among them. The workers shook their heads, and Trump quipped about the potential consequences of their presence at the press conference. The remarks were made as Trump's administration intensifies its focus on immigration enforcement. The remarks were not meant to be taken seriously, and are a reflection of the President's sense of humor.</p>

          <h2>Companies Use 'Tariff Engineering' to Reduce Duty Liabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 22:59:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering materials or dimensions to fit into different product classifications. This legal practice involves strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements, switching to cotton materials, and adding cubic zirconia to products. Companies must tread a fine line between redesigning products and fraudulently misrepresenting classifications. The practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882. This shows how businesses are adapting to changing trade policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from Zillow, a home's interior paint colors can boost its sale price by almost $2,600. The hottest kitchen color is olive green, which can generate more buyer interest and potentially add $1,600 to the sale price. Classic navy walls are most desired in bedrooms, with buyers willing to pay an estimated $1,815 more for a home featuring this color. Dark gray is preferred in living rooms, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors can decrease a home's sale price. This highlights the importance of aesthetic considerations in real estate.</p>

          <p>AstroAI recalled nearly 250,000 minifridges due to fire and burn hazards. The electrical switch in the personal refrigerators can short circuit, posing risks. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received at least 70 reports of minifridges emitting smoke, burning, melting, or catching fire, with two fires causing over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the recalled fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement. The minifridges were sold online from June 2019 through June 2022. This is a positive action to mitigate potential risks.</p>

He believes Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel should benefit the U.S. economy, although he doubts trade levies will revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, following approval from President Trump. The deal includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, committing to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh. This move shows the company is committed to growing and expanding its market share.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies is seeking to deepen its role as a global supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G infrastructure for network operators. At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, Huawei deputy chairman Eric Xu Zhijun identified key paths to industry growth, including tapping new user groups, increasing high-definition video supply, enabling intelligent connected vehicles, and expanding fibre-to-the-room. Xu emphasized the importance of working with global carriers to achieve sustainable growth. This comes despite geopolitical risks Huawei has faced since U.S. sanctions in 2019.

          <p>The majority ownership of the Lakers is being sold to Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and his TWG Global group at a franchise valuation of $10 billion. Walter's team has been in the playoffs every year since 2013, won their division 11 of those 12 years, appeared in four World Series and won two of them. Since Jerry Buss‚Äô death, the vision-less Lakers have wandered through the NBA desert in search of a strong leader who could build for sustained success. This is a good sign for the team.</p>
