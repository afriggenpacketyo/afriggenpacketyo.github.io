          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite broader economic uncertainties. The unemployment rate also saw a slight decrease to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. This strong performance, detailed in the latest Labor Department report, suggests the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates for now. Economists note the market's sturdiness in the face of potential tariff impacts and slowing growth projections for later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American retail industry is reacting with cautious relief to a tentative trade deal with Vietnam that sets tariffs on imports at 20%. While this rate is double the current 10% duty, it is significantly lower than the 46% tariff President Trump had previously proposed, which caused considerable alarm among businesses. Many major retailers like Nike and Gap have increasingly relied on Vietnam to diversify their supply chains away from China. Executives remain concerned that the increased costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers, potentially dampening spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Olivia Munn recently spoke out about long-standing rumors that she was the cause of the family rift involving her former partner, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers. During a podcast appearance, Munn stated that the family's internal dynamics existed before her relationship and that she was unfairly blamed for Rodgers' estrangement from his parents and brothers. She expressed gratitude that Rodgers himself clarified in a 2024 biography that she was not responsible for the schism. Munn, who dated Rodgers from 2014 to 2017, drew parallels to how other female partners of famous athletes are often blamed for their on-field performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners facing rising insurance costs can potentially lower their premiums by undertaking specific strategic renovations, according to insurance experts. Projects that reduce risk, such as full roof replacements with impact-resistant materials or upgrading electrical and plumbing systems, are often rewarded with discounts. Installing monitored security systems and storm shutters can also lead to savings by mitigating threats of theft, fire, and weather damage. Conversely, cosmetic upgrades like kitchen remodels or adding a swimming pool typically increase replacement costs and liability, and are unlikely to lower insurance rates.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for the first time in the Caribbean. While the drone vessel was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a trial run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking cartel. The use of such unmanned technology reflects a growing sophistication among cartels, allowing them to conduct operations with greater stealth and without risking the capture of crew members. Manned narco subs have long been used to transport cocaine, but this seizure highlights a significant technological evolution in trafficking methods.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that seniors should re-evaluate their life insurance policies to ensure they align with their current needs in today's economic climate. Key questions to consider include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if existing plans match their estate goals. As financial obligations like mortgages and college costs diminish, needs may shift toward covering final expenses or creating a legacy. Professionals advise reviewing beneficiaries, considering trust structures to avoid potential issues for heirs, and exploring how policies can be used for charitable giving.</p>

Other beneficial choices include Gouda, whose cultured properties and unique amino acids are advantageous, and part-skim mozzarella, which is low in carbohydrates and sodium.
