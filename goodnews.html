Their connection deepened over a spontaneous road trip through California and a sunset cruise, culminating in a heartfelt proposal. Now married and living in Marina del Rey, she reflects on finding love at 42 when she least expected it, crediting the city with bringing them together.</p>

          <p>President Trump is celebrating the narrow passage of his comprehensive domestic policy bill, which he is expected to sign into law. The legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," extends his 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, and allocates billions for border security. Despite polls showing public opposition, Trump insists the bill is "very popular," primarily due to its tax-cutting provisions. The package also includes significant changes to Medicaid and food stamp programs, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats who argue it benefits the wealthy at the expense of low-income Americans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major blackout struck the Czech Republic on Friday, leaving large areas, including parts of the capital, Prague, without electricity. The national grid operator, CEPS, confirmed the outage was caused by a fallen power line and reported that supply had been restored to most affected areas relatively quickly. The disruption temporarily halted train services in five of the country's fourteen districts and knocked Prague's subway system offline for a short period. Authorities have stated there is no information to suggest the event was the result of a cyber or terror attack, alleviating initial concerns.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on her initial reluctance to read Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," having once viewed it as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism. Upon finally reading the essay, she discovered a powerful and resonant work that transcends its era, finding Woolf's arguments about the systemic suppression of women's voices still relevant today. While acknowledging the book's class and racial blind spots, the author argues Woolf would embrace modern intersectionality. The essay concludes by considering how the modern constraints on women, particularly the lack of time, add a new layer to Woolf's original thesis on financial independence.</p>

          <h2>How the Continental Army Forged a National Identity for the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical analysis argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington, was instrumental in creating the very foundations of American national identity during the Revolutionary War. Before the war, the thirteen colonies were disparate and competitive, lacking a shared culture. The army fostered unity through shared struggle, sacrifice, and the creation of new traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the king's. In the post-war years, veterans continued this nation-building project, advocating for a strong federal government to preserve the republic they had fought to establish, a process that remains a work in progress.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously voted to restrict tour buses from entering the Pacific Palisades fire zone and other future disaster areas, a practice dubbed "disaster tourism." The move follows reports of commercial tour operators running busloads of tourists through neighborhoods devastated by the January firestorm, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Councilmember Traci Park, who introduced the motion, called the practice "gross" and dangerous, as it could interfere with ongoing debris-clearing and rebuilding efforts. The ban will be in effect for the duration of any declared natural disaster emergency.</p>

          <p>The ambitious $6 billion plan by singer Akon to build a futuristic city in Senegal has been officially abandoned, according to the country's tourism development agency. The project, announced in 2018 and often compared to the fictional Wakanda, has seen no significant construction in five years, with the proposed site remaining largely empty. Officials cited a lack of funding and stalled progress as key reasons for the decision. However, the government stated it is now working with Akon on a more "realistic" development project for the same strategically valuable coastal land, especially with the 2026 Youth Olympic Games approaching.</p>

          <p>A rare, handwritten letter from Thomas Jefferson, long thought to be missing, has been uncovered and is being offered for sale. Penned in 1783, the letter discusses the revolutionary fervor spreading in Europe and expresses his support for the right of citizens to take up arms against autocratic rulers, drawing a parallel to the American Revolution. Jefferson specifically notes a movement in the Dutch states where citizens were demanding this right. The document provides a valuable historical snapshot of Jefferson's views on democratic movements and the principles of the new American nation shortly after its founding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the early 1990s, the Walt Disney Company planned an ambitious and controversial theme park in Virginia called "Disney's America," intended to explore US history, including its most painful aspects. Executives at the time stated they wanted to make visitors "feel what it was like to be a slave." The proposal sparked a culture war, drawing opposition from a coalition of historians, environmentalists, and locals concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history and the park's proximity to the Manassas Civil War battlefield. After intense public debate and political hearings, Disney ultimately abandoned the project in 1994, a battle that foreshadowed today's ongoing conflicts over how American history is told.</p>

          <p>A North Korean civilian has been taken into custody by the South Korean military after successfully crossing the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The man was first detected near the Military Demarcation Line on Thursday, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation by South Korean troops. The mission was complex due to dense vegetation and landmine risks in the area. The man, who remained mostly still during the day, was approached at night and willingly followed the troops to safety. He will now be investigated by relevant authorities, as is standard procedure for defectors.</p>

While official attendance figures averaged a solid 35,000 per game, this represented only 51% of the total capacity of the large US stadiums used, with many games appearing sparse. Oppressive heat was a major factor, particularly for weekday afternoon kick-offs, with some games played in "oppressive" humidity. On the field, data supports the narrative that South American teams, particularly from Brazil, have performed strongly, earning a win or draw in 77% of their matches.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered dozens of wooden artifacts in southwest China that date back 300,000 years, providing the first concrete evidence of a sophisticated "Wood Age" in East Asia. The discovery at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province fills a major gap in the archaeological record, as wood decomposes easily and ancient wooden tools are rarely found. The find, described as a "world-class discovery," suggests that wood was a crucial material for early hominids in the region, challenging previous understandings of Paleolithic tool use which have been heavily focused on stone implements due to their durability and prevalence.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright streak across the sky on Thursday, accompanied by reports of an orange glow and a loud bang from residents in the west Highlands. Using observations and camera footage, UKMON calculated that the object descended to about 12 miles above the ground before likely scattering pieces. The network has appealed to hillwalkers to look out for the rare space rocks.</p>
