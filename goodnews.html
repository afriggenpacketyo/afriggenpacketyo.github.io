Trump expressed a desire to meet with Kim Jong Un again "this year," emphasizing his "very good relationships" with North Korea's leader. He also pressed South Korea to pay more for hosting U.S. troops and sought U.S. ownership of the land for American military bases. Hours before the meeting, Trump had criticized South Korea on social media, alluding to a "purge" or "revolution" related to raids on churches and a military base, adding a complex dynamic to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Kraken Robotics Inc. saw its shares drop 8.2% after releasing quarterly results, despite revenues of CA$26 million beating analyst forecasts. Analysts have since become more bearish on earnings per share (EPS) for 2025, reducing estimates by 14% to CA$0.042, while revenue forecasts remained stable at CA$123.0 million. Despite the cut in earnings forecasts, analysts lifted their price target for the company by 5.3% to CA$4.25, suggesting a long-term confidence in the stock's value. The company is projected to achieve a significant 36% improvement in revenue for 2025, outpacing the industry's 15% annual growth forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, stated that he is not looking to acquire another railroad company, despite meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs earlier this month. The discussion focused on increasing cooperation to enhance freight rail efficiency, aiming to achieve benefits similar to those from a merger without an acquisition. Following this announcement, CSX shares fell over 4%, with Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern also experiencing declines. This clarification comes after a partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX was announced, and amidst speculation of a takeover in the railroad sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials announced the arrest of several alleged South L.A. gang members, identified as the "Rich Rollin’ Burglary Crew," accused of nearly 100 home and business break-ins, primarily on the city’s Westside. District Attorney Nathan Hochman characterized these as "crimes of greed," with the crew targeting high-end jewelry, purses, and guns for resale. The investigation gained traction in February with the arrest of three suspects after a vehicle pursuit, leading to a significant April search warrant that uncovered weapons and stolen goods. Mayor Karen Bass lauded the operation as a "major win" for the city's safety.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a disruptive passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the safe landing of Flight 1705 after the crew reported a disturbance. While Air Canada did not disclose specific details of the passenger's actions, the incident was resolved without an arrest, and the flight subsequently departed for Las Vegas, arriving three hours behind schedule. This event adds to over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents reported by airlines this year, with violators facing substantial civil penalties.</p>

          <p>The Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) has announced the creation of a new Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league, starting in 2026, acknowledging the transformative importance of this role in modern baseball. This new honor addresses a long-standing gap, as relievers have rarely won major awards like the Cy Young or MVP since the early 1990s, despite their critical impact on games. The decision reflects the evolution of the relief pitcher from a secondary role to a vital position, often manned by top-tier talent. This article aims to provide long-overdue recognition for these specialists beyond the flawed save statistic.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has progressed to the second round of the US Open after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, retired due to injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned from a shin stress fracture and appeared to be struggling with an abdominal issue, ended the match. Despite feeling "nervous" about the early start, Norrie secured his advancement in the tournament. He expressed sympathy for Korda's injury-forced withdrawal, acknowledging his opponent's talent and previous victories against him. Norrie will now face either Francisco Comesana or Alex Michelsen in the next round.</p>

Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell praised Nakagawa's background and passion for dance education, despite his lack of traditional curatorial or administrative experience for such a high-profile role. His predecessor, Jane Raleigh, alleged her dismissal was retaliation for supporting a union organizing campaign. This appointment comes as the Kennedy Center seeks a significant increase in federal funding, facing political challenges over potential renaming of its opera house.</p>

Copper is crucial for transportation, defense, and the U.S. power grid, which faces rising electricity demand, while potash is essential for fertilizer production.

The mission seeks to test the Super Heavy first stage for controlled splashdown and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory for an Indian Ocean splashdown, including deploying Starlink simulators and engine restarts. This flight is crucial for restoring confidence in the rocket's viability for future moon missions, particularly a NASA-planned 2027 landing, which some experts doubt can be achieved with the current architecture and complex in-orbit refueling requirements.

While the individual has recovered and the risk of transmission within the U.S. is considered very low, this detection raises vigilance. The New World screwworm, typically found in South America, poses a significant threat to livestock, and its northward spread has prompted federal action. The USDA is planning a new sterile fly production facility in Texas and other measures to combat the parasite, aiming to prevent a potential $10.6 billion economic loss to the cattle industry.</p>

The combined coffee business, including brands like L'OR and Jacobs, is projected to generate $16 billion in annual net sales, enhancing competition with industry giants like Nestle and Starbucks. The cold beverage entity will focus on its faster-growing portfolio. The separation is expected to yield $400 million in savings and conclude in the first half of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The "Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act" aims to make this practice illegal by requiring job posts to include details like intended hire dates, whether the role is new or a backfill, and previous posting history. The proposed law, targeting businesses with over 50 employees, would also set limits on posting duration and application review periods, with violators facing fines.
