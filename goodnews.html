          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created a pure, macroscopic hexagonal diamond, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This variant, known as lonsdaleite, is believed to form under intense heat and pressure and is theoretically harder than conventional cubic diamonds. The breakthrough, detailed in the journal Nature, marks a significant advance after decades of global efforts to synthesize the material, which previously resulted in impure or mixed-phase samples.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small, mood-boosting purchases and larger, memorable experiences to cope with economic instability. An evolution of the "lipstick effect," this behavior involves cutting back on daily essentials while splurging on items from makeup to concert tickets. Analysts note this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional milestones like home ownership for younger generations. (not investment advice)</p>
