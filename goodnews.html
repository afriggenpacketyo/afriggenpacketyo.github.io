          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% jump in revenue to $44.1 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, despite U.S. government restrictions on A.I. chip sales to China, however the net income rose 26 percent to $18.78 billion, falling short of predictions. CEO Jensen Huang criticized these restrictions, arguing they hinder U.S. competitiveness and empower Chinese chipmakers. Nvidia is expanding its customer base, targeting governments and securing deals like the one with the United Arab Emirates to build an A.I. data center hub. The company projects continued growth, driven by its new Blackwell chip, and is managing a busy supply chain to meet high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the "TACO trade," an acronym for "Trump Always Chickens Out," describing the market's reaction to President Trump's tariff policies. Coined by a Financial Times journalist, the term refers to stocks dropping when Trump announces tariffs and then rising when he eases them. Trump has eased tariffs on China and Europe, causing market jumps, but he denies "chickening out," calling it negotiation. Investors are growing comfortable with this pattern, but concerns remain about inflation and the U.S. fiscal outlook.</p>

This development follows China's report to the UN about evasive maneuvers Tiangong had to perform to avoid collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites. The system aims to protect critical space infrastructure from deliberate or accidental interference from other spacecraft.</p>
