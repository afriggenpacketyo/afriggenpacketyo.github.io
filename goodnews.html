          <p>A widespread technology outage impacted several major online platforms, including Google, OpenAI, Spotify, and Amazon Web Services, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users. Cloudflare, which provides services to many of the affected companies, reported intermittent failures and investigated the matter, identifying Google Cloud as the source of the outage. Services began to recover after approximately an hour, with Spotify experiencing the most significant disruptions. The incident highlights the interconnectedness of online services and the potential for widespread impact from a single point of failure, while the recovery of services suggests a relatively stable system. This is an event which reflects a relatively low impact to human life.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists discovered a 16th-century merchant ship more than 1.5 miles underwater off southern France, the deepest such find in French waters. The ship, believed to be sailing from northern Italy, was found by chance during a military operation to explore the seabed. The wreck is largely preserved intact, offering the opportunity to study a 16th-century vessel. Experts plan to create a 3D digital version of the ship and extract samples for further study.
