          <p>Tennis stars Naomi Osaka and Amanda Anisimova are set to face each other in the U.S. Open semifinals, a match highlighting both athletes' remarkable returns to the sport. Both players took extended breaks from tennis in recent years to focus on their mental health, facing significant challenges to climb back up the world rankings. Their semifinal appearance is seen as a major victory for their careers and for the broader conversation around mental health in professional sports, regardless of the match's outcome.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:29:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial conducted by researchers at Saarland University in Germany found that an over-the-counter azelastine nasal spray could substantially lower the risk of contracting COVID-19. In the study, healthy adults who used the spray three times daily had a 2.2% infection rate, compared to 6.7% in the placebo group. The findings suggest the readily available allergy spray may serve as an additional prophylactic measure, particularly for vulnerable individuals, though researchers emphasize the need for larger trials to confirm its effectiveness against various respiratory viruses.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that a coalition of 26 Western allies is prepared to deploy troops to Ukraine immediately following a ceasefire agreement to provide security guarantees. This "reassurance force" would be activated the moment hostilities cease, with U.S. support for the initiative expected to be finalized soon. The announcement comes amid dimming prospects for direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, as allies focus on securing a ceasefire first and then providing robust security assurances to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis examines the best age for Americans to claim Social Security benefits to maximize their retirement income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, this results in a permanently reduced monthly payment. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) provides the standard benefit, but delaying until age 70 can increase payments by approximately 8% for each year of deferral. The article suggests that for those who can afford to wait, delaying claims can provide a significantly larger and more secure income stream in later life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea has reached a club-record agreement, valued at nearly £1 million, to acquire 20-year-old forward Alyssa Thompson from the NWSL club Angel City. The United States international is considered one of the world's most promising young talents and is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Women's Super League team. This transfer surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma and will provide a crucial boost to the team's attack, which has been affected by recent injuries to key players.</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up 53.7% year-over-year, marking its best performance in 21 years. This growth in a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle stands out as the automotive industry heavily promotes electric vehicles. While Ford's EV sales also grew, the strong demand for the profitable three-row SUV indicates a persistent consumer interest in larger, gasoline-fueled vehicles, aligning with the company's strategy to balance its portfolio with both EV and hybrid models.</p>

          <p>After 24 years leading the club, Daniel Levy is stepping down from his role as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. Appointed in 2001, his tenure was marked by significant developments, including the construction of the state-of-the-art Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and a recent Europa League victory. Despite these achievements, Levy's leadership faced criticism from some fans over the team's inconsistent league performance and lack of major trophies.

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep and often overlooked influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved Black people, on mainstream American culture. The book argues that many common traditions, from Southern cuisine like black-eyed peas to the musical roots of the blues, have origins in the rituals of conjure women. Stewart traces this lineage to show how these women, through their roles as healers, cooks, and spiritual guides, have shaped American life for centuries, asserting their power and resilience.</p>
