          <p>An increasing number of U.S. adults, particularly those under 30, are now regularly getting their news from TikTok, relying on "newsfluencers" and viral clips rather than traditional media outlets. The platform's algorithm-driven, short-form video format presents a new model for information consumption that prioritizes speed and engagement. This shift raises questions about journalistic standards, the potential for misinformation, and how complex events are conveyed through memes and brief summaries. Despite these concerns, creators on the platform are building massive followings by catering to an audience with a shorter attention span.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed with a lower court that such practices, used during Trump administration sweeps, violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures without reasonable suspicion. The ruling is a victory for immigrant advocates who argued the raids constituted unconstitutional racial profiling and instilled fear in the community.</p>

Investigators allege that a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel received kickbacks from suppliers. This major anti-corruption bust comes just two days after the independence of these agencies was restored by parliament, following massive public protests against a government attempt to curb their powers. President Zelenskyy has praised the investigation, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption amid the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical roots of why many Black Americans do not know how to swim, tracing it back to decades of segregation at public pools. It highlights the work of modern organizations like Black People Will Swim, which are dedicated to closing this gap and addressing the resulting public health crisis. Data shows that Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a disparity these groups aim to correct by making swim lessons more accessible and creating a new generation of swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly emerged as a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year. This growth is not driven by rooftop panels but by large projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light, which find solar to be more economical than natural gas. The boom is occurring despite the state government removing climate change from official policy, underscoring that cost-effectiveness is the primary motivator. However, future growth faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests that aligning your workout routine with your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and long-term commitment to fitness. Researchers found correlations between the "Big Five" personality traits and exercise preferences.

The findings encourage individuals to experiment with different activities to find what best suits their disposition.</p>
