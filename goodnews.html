          <p>Gold prices have surged to record highs, gaining approximately 35% this year amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Experts suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking physical gold are a liquid and low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to the precious metal. These are often preferred over owning physical bullion due to lower transaction and storage costs. Financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Utah's Partisan Congressional Map Ruled Unconstitutional by State Judge</h2>

          <p>A Utah judge has struck down the state's congressional map, declaring it an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that deliberately diluted the votes of some citizens. The ruling is a significant victory for voting rights advocates, as it found that the Republican-controlled legislature had improperly ignored a voter-approved ballot measure that created an independent redistricting commission. The court has ordered the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, pushing back against the trend of lawmakers overriding the will of the electorate.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has successfully negotiated the release of more than 300 of its citizens who were detained during a major US immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The operation was the largest single-site raid conducted under the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Following swift diplomatic action from Seoul, the detained workers are expected to be sent home on a chartered flight once the final administrative procedures are completed, resolving a tense international incident.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK have an opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will turn the Moon a reddish color, an effect often called a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth aligns perfectly between the Sun and Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The red hue is caused by sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere, the same phenomenon that creates red sunsets. The article provides specific timings and advice for viewing the event, noting that visibility will be best in eastern parts of the country.</p>

Anutin secured the premiership with the backing of the main opposition party, under the condition that he dissolve parliament and call for new elections within the next four months to ensure a fresh democratic mandate.</p>
