          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers broke a five-game losing streak with a crucial 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles, providing much-needed relief after a period of mounting frustration. Shohei Ohtani ignited the offense early, hitting two home runs, including his 12th leadoff blast of the year which tied a franchise record. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance, striking out eight batters over nearly six innings to secure the win. The victory helped the team regain some stability after a difficult road trip that had seen their division lead shrink.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, emphasized that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." His comments follow President Trump's public pressure on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates, raising concerns about the White House's influence. Hassett argued that history shows political control over central banks is a "recipe for inflation and misery." His statement aligns with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's call for a widespread review of the Federal Reserve to protect its independence from mission creep. (not investment advice)</p>
