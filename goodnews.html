          <p>The skulls of 19 Black Americans, used in discredited racial science in the 19th century, have been returned to New Orleans after 150 years in Germany.

The return marks a step toward reconciliation and remembrance of the individuals whose remains were exploited for racist research.

          <p>Japan and the U.S. have reported progress in tariff negotiations, aiming for a potential deal as early as next month, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator. Ryosei Akazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, with plans for further talks before the G7 summit in June. Japan seeks the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports, while the U.S. emphasizes boosting investment and addressing economic security issues. These discussions follow earlier proposals from Japan, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity (not investment advice).</p>

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store acknowledged the issue has spun out of control, leading to concerns about teenagers' well-being, grades, and financial strain. The plan is to move celebrations to the post-exam period to mitigate the negative impacts on academics and reduce social exclusion. The russebuss tradition involves renting and decorating party buses, leading to heavy drinking, drug use, and sleep deprivation, with many teenagers feeling left out due to the high costs.</p>
