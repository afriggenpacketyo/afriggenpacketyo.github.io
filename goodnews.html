          <p>The No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes secured a 14-7 victory over the top-ranked Texas Longhorns in a defensive struggle reminiscent of last season's Cotton Bowl. Texas quarterback Arch Manning struggled in his first career road start, throwing for 170 yards, with most of his production coming late in the game. The Ohio State defense was formidable, holding the Longhorns' offense in check and forcing key turnovers and fourth-down stops. The Buckeyes' offense, led by quarterback Julian Sayin, did just enough to win, scoring a crucial touchdown in the fourth quarter to seal the game.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the win was overshadowed by persistent and costly errors from the team's goalkeepers, a problem that has plagued them in recent matches. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir's mistake allowed Burnley to equalize, highlighting a vulnerability Amorim acknowledged is making the team susceptible to conceding easily. The victory also brought fresh injury concerns for key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the manager's challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, medical and psychological experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For the first few years, experts recommend minimal to no screen time, emphasizing that children need to explore their physical environment to develop attention control and motor skills. As children get older, limited and supervised screen time is suggested to ensure they also develop imagination, social skills, and a moral compass without excessive digital influence. While acknowledging the role of digital interaction in modern life, experts stress that content and context are more important than time alone.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, delivering another man-of-the-match performance in a 3-2 win at Wolves. After providing two assists in consecutive Premier League games, Grealish has become a central figure for his new club, a stark contrast to his limited playing time last season. His impressive form has reignited discussions about his exclusion from the England national team by manager Thomas Tuchel. Everton manager David Moyes praised Grealish's impact, suggesting the player is thriving with more game time and responsibility.</p>

          <p>After two tense opening matches, American tennis star Coco Gauff delivered a commanding performance to defeat Magdalena Frech 6-3, 6-1 and advance to the fourth round of the US Open. Gauff, who recently made changes to her coaching team to address serving issues, appeared more settled and confident, controlling the match from the baseline. She landed nearly 80% of her first serves in the opening set and showed improved mental fortitude throughout the 73-minute contest. Gauff will now face two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka in a highly anticipated round-of-16 matchup.</p>

          <p>Germany is ending a freeze on admitting vulnerable Afghans who had been promised entry, many of whom are currently in Pakistan facing the threat of deportation. After fleeing the Taliban in 2021, thousands of Afghans with ties to German organizations have been waiting for visas, living in fear of being arrested and sent back to Afghanistan. The German government's decision to resume the process follows pressure from human rights groups and German court rulings that affirmed the commitments were legally binding. The first families are expected to arrive in Germany on scheduled flights in the coming days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a study across over 200 GP surgeries and found the device significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle sounds in the heartbeat that the human ear cannot perceive and compares them to a large patient database. Experts believe this innovation could be a "real game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.</p>
