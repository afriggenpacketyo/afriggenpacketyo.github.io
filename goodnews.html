          <p>Two individuals, Cortnie Harris and Corvanntay Baptiste, have been arrested for allegedly assisting some of the ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail. Harris is accused of transporting two of the escaped inmates to various locations in New Orleans and having prior contact with another inmate still at large. Baptiste allegedly provided food to escaped inmate Corey Boyd while he was in hiding, before Boyd was captured. These arrests follow the apprehension of Sterling Williams, a maintenance worker at the jail, who claimed he was threatened by one of the inmates involved in the escape. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freedom Debt Relief offers debt settlement services, negotiating with creditors to reduce debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free consultation, a dedicated FDIC-insured account for accumulating funds, and negotiation with creditors. Fees range from 15% to 25% of the total enrolled debt, paid as debts are settled, and the program typically lasts 24 to 48 months. While it can reduce debt, it may severely damage credit scores and creditors may sue. The company has positive reviews and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, but it should be viewed as a serious intervention, not a quick fix. </p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings saw the failure of a proposal to ban the "tush push," a play successfully executed by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal to ban the play fell short of the required 75% majority, with a vote of 22-10. The Eagles posted celebratory content on social media, while owner Jeffrey Lurie defended the play, emphasizing player safety. The Packers had cited player safety and pace of play as reasons to ban the tush push, but the NFL has stated that no injuries have been reported on the play. </p>

          <p>Oklahoma has significantly improved its stream quality by implementing a simple solution: providing cows with clean drinking water and keeping them out of the streams. Farmer Grant Victor fenced off his cattle from Horse Creek, allowing the creek's banks to recover and its waters to clear. As a result, Horse Creek is no longer on the state's list of most contaminated waterways. Oklahoma has restored about 100 streams once polluted by farmland runoff, more than any other state, according to the EPA. </p>

          <p>For beginners interested in investing in gold bars and coins, there are new and easier ways to invest, such as online gold investment companies and even big box retailers like Walmart and Costco. Fractional gold offers an accessible entry point, allowing investors to start with smaller amounts. While gold prices are currently high, they are likely to rise again due to factors like inflation and geopolitical tensions, making it prudent to invest sooner rather than later. Gold should be a small portion of a diversified portfolio (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court's order to return a Venezuelan migrant deported to El Salvador, marking another setback in legal battles over the Alien Enemies Act. The 4th Circuit's decision upholds a ruling that the deportation violated an agreement with migrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children and sought asylum. The court stressed the importance of preventing the executive branch from undermining judicial review, with one judge stating, "It is the duty of courts to stand as a bulwark against the political tides". </p>

          <p>The UK government is considering restricting or banning the private prescription of cross-sex hormones to individuals under 18, following a review of the use of such medication. Health Secretary Wes Streeting is seeking clinical and expert advice from NHS England on the matter. The case was brought after the NHS announced it would no longer prescribe puberty blockers at gender identity clinics for under-18s. The government is also exploring alternative legal mechanisms to address private and overseas providers prescribing these drugs. </p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose rose sharply after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates, although it pulled its fiscal 2026 outlook due to "macroeconomic uncertainty." Canada Goose COO Beth Clymer said that 75% of Canada Goose's units are made in Canada and "virtually all" are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. CEO Dani Reiss added that the "vast majority" of the retailer's products are not currently impacted by tariffs. The company's revenue was up 7.4% from the same period last year. </p>
