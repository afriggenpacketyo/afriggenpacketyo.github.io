          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, which is based on a two-stage U.S. framework. The deal would involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages, followed by negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently insisted on the release of all hostages at once. The development occurs amidst intense Israeli strikes on Gaza City and large-scale protests in Tel Aviv demanding the government secure a deal to bring all hostages home.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million, resolving claims that the network broadcasted false allegations of election fraud in 2020. This settlement follows a larger $787 million agreement between Dominion and Fox News for similar claims. Newsmax, which was sued for $1.6 billion, will pay the amount in three installments while maintaining that its coverage was fair and criticizing the judge for what it claims would have been an unfair trial. The case was scheduled to proceed this fall in Delaware, where a judge had previously found that Dominion's complaint was reasonably inferred.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends on individual circumstances, including age, equity, income needs, and long-term goals. While homeowners can qualify at 62, waiting until the early 70s is often recommended, as older borrowers can typically access a larger portion of their home's equity. A reverse mortgage can provide tax-free income and eliminate monthly mortgage payments for retirees on a fixed income, but it also reduces the home's equity, potentially affecting inheritances. Homeowners should carefully weigh their health, plans to age in place, and other retirement income sources before committing to this complex financial product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic, particularly those facing barriers to healthcare. A study published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people using the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception at all. The data showed that users of the prescription-free pill were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and live in rural areas. The most cited reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment, highlighting the impact of increased accessibility on contraceptive use.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak in Texas that began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The declaration comes after 42 days—twice the disease's maximum incubation period—have passed without a new case being reported in counties with previous transmission. The outbreak primarily affected children, with two unvaccinated children tragically dying from the highly contagious virus. Despite the outbreak's conclusion, officials urge continued vigilance from healthcare providers, as ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. mean additional cases could still appear in the state.</p>

          <p>Millions of current and former AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches can now file claims for compensation as part of a $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches, announced in March and July of 2024, exposed the personal information of nearly all of the company's cellular customers, including Social Security numbers. Impacted individuals can claim up to $7,500 for documented losses traceable to the breaches by submitting a form online or by mail before November 18, 2025. The settlement awaits final court approval, with a hearing scheduled for December, so payments will not be issued until after that date.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club addressed a short-term negative call on cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike from Evercore ISI, suggesting that post-earnings pullbacks for the company are common and have historically presented buying opportunities. The club is also watching for earnings results from its other cyber holding, Palo Alto Networks, hoping it will buck the trend of a lackluster earnings season for some names in the sector. They are specifically looking for confirmation that the company's core business remains strong following its major acquisition of CyberArk. The commentary comes as the broader market awaits Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW as part of its spinoff from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the channel as it becomes part of a new independent business called Versant. The spinoff will also include CNBC and entertainment networks like USA and E!, all of which will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo. MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler stated the decision allows the brand to set its own course and assert its independence while committing to its core mission.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 11:19:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash, less than half of its current list price of nearly $1,350. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and comes amid significant political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including the drug's website and partnerships like GoodRx. This strategy is also seen as an effort to steer patients toward the branded medication and away from potentially unsafe compounded copycats that gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House has agreed to be acquired and taken private in a $2.7 billion deal led by hotel group MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo.

          <p>Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power are partnering to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) grid by 2030. Under the agreement, TVA will purchase up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power from the Hermes 2 reactor to help power Google's regional data centers. This collaboration marks a significant step for advanced nuclear energy, as it is the first U.S. power purchase agreement for such a reactor, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk of construction. The project aims to demonstrate the viability of smaller, more affordable nuclear plants to meet the growing energy demands of technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>
