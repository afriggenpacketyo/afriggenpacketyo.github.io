          <p>During a WNBA playoff game between the Indiana Fever and the Atlanta Dream, player Sophie Cunningham was involved in a verbal exchange with an Atlanta police officer at center court. The confrontation occurred during an injury timeout with just over four minutes remaining in the game. Cunningham, who is sidelined with an injury alongside teammate Caitlin Clark, later posted a photo of the encounter on social media with a caption celebrating her "aura." Despite the absence of its stars, the Fever won the game and the series, advancing to the next round of the playoffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would involve a sale to a group of American investors, including Oracle. However, Chinese state media presented a more ambiguous stance, stating that Beijing welcomes negotiations, with the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm remaining a key point of contention. The deal aims to address U.S. national security concerns over the app's data collection practices and its ties to the Chinese government. Trump noted that a formal signing process is still required to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters, posing no immediate threat to land. Gabrielle's projected path shows it moving north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the storm could pass east of Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify, and officials will continue to monitor its development and track.</p>

          <p>Tejasvi Manoj, a 17-year-old from Plano, Texas, has been named Time magazine's "Kid of the Year" for her work in combating financial scams targeting senior citizens. Inspired by a scam attempt on her own grandfather, Manoj developed a website and an AI-powered app called Shield Seniors to educate older adults on how to identify and report fraudulent messages. She now conducts workshops at senior centers, addressing a growing problem that saw individuals over 60 lose $4.8 billion to scams in 2024. Manoj, who is largely self-taught in coding, hopes the recognition will help her secure funding to launch her app.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many Chinese companies are now focusing on Southeast Asia as a key area for growth. A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a strategic testing ground for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region. Companies see significant potential in Southeast Asia's large population and rapidly growing economies. This strategic shift reflects a broader trend of Chinese businesses diversifying their international footprints and adapting to changing global economic conditions and geopolitical landscapes, seeking new avenues for expansion and revenue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing improper and politically motivated language in the complaint. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and resembled a political speech rather than a legal document. The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but gave Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, promoting his new film "Steve," has reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," emphasizing that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed.

He also confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix but kept plot details confidential. His new film, "Steve," follows his character's efforts to manage a reform school for troubled boys in the 1990s.</p>
