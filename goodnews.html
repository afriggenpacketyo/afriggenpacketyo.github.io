The plot was part of a vendetta by two co-conspirators against a local businessman's family. Betro, disguised in a niqab, tried to fire at her target at point-blank range, but the gun jammed, allowing the victim to escape unharmed. After being on the run for nearly five years, she was convicted and is scheduled for sentencing on August 21.</p>

          <p>His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK's tax authority, has confirmed its use of artificial intelligence to scan the social media accounts of individuals suspected of tax evasion as part of criminal probes. The agency stated that the technology supports its compliance staff and helps target fraud more effectively, but clarified it would not replace human decision-making and is subject to legal oversight. While government investigators have long used social media, the partial automation of this process is new. Experts have raised concerns about potential risks like mistaken identity from fake or hacked accounts.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty has acquired Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, in a deal valued at $1 billion, a move that will expand its presence into Sephora stores. Despite a recent 11% drop in its stock price following a decline in net income, which the company attributes to tariffs on Chinese imports, CEO Tarang Amin remains confident. He highlighted E.l.f.'s 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and its position as a top brand among younger consumers. The acquisition of Rhode, which achieved $212 million in net sales in three years, is seen as a strategic move to bolster its market position.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, savers are evaluating the best places for their cash, with money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts being top contenders. Both offer competitive, variable interest rates, but experts note key differences. Money market accounts often provide check-writing and debit card access but may require higher minimum balances to earn the best rates. High-yield savings accounts typically have lower entry barriers and are ideal for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals. The best choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus maximizing returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but don't need the funds for living expenses have several strategic options. Financial experts suggest reinvesting the money into a brokerage account, often using tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for long-term growth. Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that satisfies the RMD. For legacy planning, the funds can also be used to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members, which may offer state tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has stated that Isak is not currently involved in his plans, and the player is expected to miss the team's season opener.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the strong top-line growth reflects increasing interest from financial institutions, especially following supportive crypto legislation signed by the Trump administration.
