          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a decline after the online brokerage was not included in the latest S&P 500 Index rebalance, despite earlier speculation and a Bank of America recommendation. Inclusion in the S&P 500 typically leads to increased trading volume and investment from passive funds, as seen with Coinbase's recent inclusion.

The city, county, and nonprofits are collaborating to plant thousands of trees annually, focusing on drought-tolerant species that provide shade. Research indicates that trees can significantly lower temperatures, offering relief from the extreme heat that contributed to over 500 deaths last summer. The initiative includes educating students about environmental conservation through school garden clubs, teaching them the importance of trees in mitigating heat and conserving water.</p>

In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM argues that better and simpler regulation is crucial for EU markets, which have fallen behind in business dynamism and investment opportunities. The fund, which held 285 billion euros in EU securities at the end of 2024, emphasizes that the lack of a single security market regulator leads to legal uncertainty and operational complexity. NBIM also calls for addressing regional fragmentation in securities law and standardizing pan-European debt issuance.</p>
