          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans for large-scale reductions in the federal workforce and agency reorganizations. Judge Illston stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates, and a President cannot initiate executive branch reorganization without Congressional partnership. The lawsuit was filed by unions and advocacy groups challenging President Trump's February 11 executive order, which aimed to transform the federal bureaucracy through significant job cuts, and the Trump administration has requested an emergency pause of the injunction from the Supreme Court.</p>

The majority of travelers are expected to drive, with gas prices being the lowest since 2021, while air travel is also anticipated to increase. Travelers are advised to prepare for crowded roads and airports by using data to plan travel times, arriving early, and ensuring they have acceptable forms of identification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea, scientists discovered that clownfish shrank in size, which may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Researchers found that the fish got shorter by a few millimeters, and this downsizing appeared to increase their chances of survival. The study adds complexity to the narrative of climate change's impact on marine life, suggesting that some species can adapt to rising temperatures in unexpected ways.</p>

          <p>Jewish director Erwin Simsensohn staged an opera about Adolf Eichmann's trial to educate people about the Holocaust and the dangers of right-wing extremism. Simsensohn, whose grandfather was deported to a labor camp, feels a personal responsibility to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive in Romania, where the country's involvement was long repressed. The opera's success has led to additional performances, emphasizing the importance of remembrance amid rising antisemitism and far-right political influence in Romania.</p>

          <p>The latest Mission: Impossible film, The Final Reckoning, shifts focus to Ethan Hunt's character, attempting to add cohesion to the series' mythology. While the film includes impressive action sequences and globe-trotting locations, the emphasis on Hunt's importance and backstory encumbers the plot and slows the pace. The series' strength has traditionally been its flamboyant action and stunts rather than deep character development, and the film's self-importance detracts from the entertainment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With most US investors in English football keeping a low profile and attending few matches, the motive seems to be financial rather than reputational. While former American owners of Sunderland and Aston Villa have lost significant amounts of money after getting involved in English football, others have been a lot more successful. With closed leagues, there are few opportunities to invest in US pro sports, and when they arise it is very expensive, so the global game of football is an attractive option, especially with NBC's coverage of the Premier League, the Welcome to Wrexham documentary series and the Ted Lasso TV show fuelling interest.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer higher returns than the current inflation rate, helping to preserve buying power. CDs also allow savers to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, and they generally come with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms, and online banks tend to offer the most competitive rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court summons for Taylor Swift has been withdrawn in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni after Swift's legal team objected that the legal order amounted to an "unwarranted fishing expedition".

Lively's spokesperson said they were "pleased" the subpoena had been withdrawn.</p>
