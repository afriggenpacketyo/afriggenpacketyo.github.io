          <p>Korean Air has finalized a significant deal with Boeing, agreeing to purchase 103 passenger jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models. This strategic acquisition aims to modernize the South Korean flag carrier's fleet and enhance its competitive edge as it progresses with its merger with Asiana Airlines, as stated by Korean Air boss Walter Cho. The announcement came shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with US President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for increased business with American firms and recently imposed 15% tariffs on South Korea in July. This substantial agreement underscores the interplay between international trade policies, corporate expansion plans in the aviation sector, and the current administration's economic agenda.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Improving Back Health Through Dynamic Posture and Movement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 20:07:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken challenges outdated notions of good posture, suggesting that rigid upright sitting can be detrimental. He advocates for three key rules to improve back health: constant movement, building core strength, and adopting a positive mindset. Instead of staying locked in one position, regular stretching and breaks are crucial for dynamic posture. Simple exercises like arm raises and head turns can build strength, while acknowledging the psychological and emotional components of pain, such as stress, is also vital for overall well-being. This article emphasizes that holistic approaches, rather than static positions or gadgets, are essential for long-term back health.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to unfavorable weather conditions, following an earlier delay caused by a ground system issue. This mission is critical for testing corrective upgrades after three previous failures and for restoring confidence in the gargantuan rocket's readiness for future lunar missions, including NASA's planned 2027 landing. The flight aimed to test the Super Heavy first stage and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and testing engine restarts. Despite skepticism from some experts about the 2027 moon landing timeline, NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to overcome these significant technical hurdles.</p>

This initiative includes nine students under the Chevening scheme and around 30 others with private scholarships. This marks the first group of Gazan students to leave the territory for UK studies since the Hamas-Israel conflict began in 2023. Significant logistical and political challenges remain, including securing Israel's approval for their departure and conducting visa checks in a third country. This decision follows months of advocacy and aims to provide critical educational opportunities amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, the 77-year-old co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, has entered a guilty plea to two drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in a New York court. This marks a significant end to one of organized crime's most notorious careers, with Zambada apologizing for the harm caused by illegal drugs and admitting to corrupting officials. His plea, which is expected to result in a more lenient sentence, follows his arrest in Texas last year after an alleged double-cross by the sons of his former ally, 'El Chapo' Guzmán.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard offloaded over 38 tons (76,140 pounds) of cocaine and marijuana at Port Everglades, Florida, marking the largest cocaine seizure in its history.

Rear Admiral Adam Chamie highlighted the immense scale of the threat, stating the cocaine alone represented 23 million potentially lethal doses—enough to fatally overdose Florida's entire population.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain their positions in tech megacaps, even when stocks experience downturns. He emphasized that significant wealth has been generated by holding these stocks through various market conditions, rather than attempting to trade in and out. Cramer acknowledged current market concerns, particularly regarding Nvidia ahead of its earnings report, but reiterated his belief in the long-term growth of generative artificial intelligence hardware, with Nvidia as a key player. He stressed the difficulty of timing sales and re-entries into these large companies, suggesting that they inevitably return to growth. (not investment advice)</p>
