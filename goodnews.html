          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to jump over 6%. The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner attributed the success to a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna, which has been managing high medical costs, and to operational efficiencies in its pharmacies. This positive report marks the third full quarter under Joyner's leadership as the company continues its broader turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Royal experts confirm that Althorp, Princess Diana's childhood home and final resting place, will not be inherited by her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Due to the tradition of primogeniture within the Spencer family, the estate is set to pass to Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, and subsequently to his eldest son, Louis Spencer. This practice dictates that titles and property are inherited by the eldest male heir, bypassing Louis's three older sisters. The rule, while seen by some as outdated, is a long-standing tradition for the Althorp estate, which has been in the Spencer family since 1508.</p>

The company, which was valued at $19.3 billion after pricing its IPO at $33 per share, is moving forward after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>An independent regulatory commission has cleared West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta of four charges related to spot-fixing, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate matches to improperly influence the betting market and faced a potential lifetime ban. While the commission found the primary charges "not proven," it did find Paqueta guilty of two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. A sanction for these breaches will be determined at a later date.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif proposes the creation of a Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement (Menara). This regional body would facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation in areas like energy, medicine, and agriculture among member states that reject nuclear weapons and agree to mutual verification. Zarif argues that after decades of paralysis on creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone, this initiative offers a new path forward, allowing the region to take control of its own security. He contends that such cooperation can build trust and enhance non-proliferation without waiting for Israeli disarmament, which has blocked progress for 50 years.</p>
