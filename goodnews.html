          <h2>Reddit to Implement Age Verification in the UK Ahead of New Online Safety Act Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:14:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit is introducing mandatory age verification in the United Kingdom to comply with the new Online Safety Act, which requires platforms with adult material to implement robust age-checking measures. Starting July 14, a third-party firm named Persona will verify users' ages through selfies or government-issued IDs for access to mature content. While Reddit will only retain the user's verification status and date of birth, privacy advocates express concern over data collection and the potential for circumvention. The UK's regulator, Ofcom, expects other companies to adopt similar measures or face significant fines and potential business disruption measures.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 stock index has achieved a new record, breaking the 9,000-point barrier for the first time. Analysts attribute the more than 10% gain in 2025 to several factors, including investors diversifying away from US markets and the UK's advantageous trade deal with the United States. The index, often criticized for its lack of tech companies, has been seen as a stable and reliable option in uncertain global economic times. Top-performing stocks include precious metals producers and defense contractors, reflecting current market trends and geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ben Stokes Leads England to Tense Cricket Victory Over India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:03:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six years to the day after his 2019 World Cup final heroics, Ben Stokes once again led England to a dramatic victory, defeating India by 22 runs in a tense third Test at Lord's. The England captain delivered a marathon bowling performance despite injury concerns, taking crucial wickets, including the final one to seal the win. Stokes's leadership and on-field intensity were instrumental, inspiring a fiery performance from his team and orchestrating the triumphant Test return of bowler Jofra Archer. The victory gives England a 2-1 lead in the five-Test series, showcasing the team's resilience under pressure.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is already planning its future, with President Gianni Infantino's ambitions for the tournament remaining strong. Despite initial criticism, the event's large prize fund has won over top clubs, and FIFA is now reportedly considering expanding the competition from 32 to 48 teams in 2029. Some clubs, like Real Madrid, have even suggested holding the tournament biennially, though FIFA has no current plans for this. The event generated significant revenue and high viewership on its streaming partner Dazn, but concerns over player welfare and a packed football calendar remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>This article from the South China Morning Post, originally published on July 16, 2005, reports on the designation of Macau's historic center as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The decision was seen as a significant boost to Macau's efforts to diversify its image beyond being solely a gambling destination. The 29 listed sites, including many unique Portuguese-style buildings, were recognized for their crucial role in the early cultural exchanges between the East and West. At the time, Macau's Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah described the collection of landmarks as a "unique, peerless jewel" for the region.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to include lessons on misogyny, consent, and the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes. The curriculum will also teach students to identify positive male role models and recognize unhealthy online influences. The government has dropped plans for strict age limits on topics, instead outlining what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. The updated guidance, which will be fully implemented by 2026, emphasizes proactive engagement with parents, who will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered a strong performance for the Los Angeles Lakers in a Summer League game against the Clippers, drawing significant attention from a crowd that included his father, LeBron James. Despite his 17 points, five rebounds, and five assists, the Lakers fell to the Clippers 67-58. James showed growing confidence, particularly with his shooting, but the Lakers struggled overall with poor shooting percentages and turnovers. Clippers forward Jordan Miller was the star of the game, scoring 19 points and leading his team to victory. Coaches praised James's energy and playmaking ability during his time on the court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable for working families. While the government and industry welcome the move, critics and some consumers argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of public charging infrastructure. The government has pledged to increase the number of charging points from 82,000 to 300,000 by 2030 to support its ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season, including seven wins and an Olympic gold medal, is being credited to his work with renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon. Scheffler, who was ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best from tee to green, sought Kenyon's help in late 2023. The coach helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the turning point. Kenyon's success with Scheffler adds to an impressive resume that includes coaching players to victories in all four major championships and an Olympic gold.</p>

          <p>Mainland China is on track to issue a record number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, driven by favorable regulations and strong investor appetite. In the first half of 2025, fund managers launched 166 new ETFs, already more than half of the all-time high of 277 set in 2021. This surge is part of a global trend, with analysts citing streamlined approval processes and reduced fees in China as key contributors. The majority of these new funds track domestic stock indexes, with others focused on bonds and overseas markets, reflecting growing demand for diverse investment options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the expiration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The Trump administration had moved to end the protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work legally, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved. An immigrant advocacy group sued the administration, and while a lower court judge allowed the lawsuit to proceed, they did not block the revocation. The appeals court has now stepped in, granting a one-week stay while it considers the case, providing a brief reprieve for Afghans who fled the Taliban.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 90% of new car sales being electric in the last year. In cities like Oslo, fully electric cars now make up 40% of all passenger vehicles on the road, resulting in cleaner air and quieter streets. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including VAT exemptions and reduced fees, combined with high taxes on polluting vehicles. A robust and expanding public charging infrastructure has also been crucial in overcoming consumer concerns and driving widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>A new district named Sickla in Stockholm, Sweden, is set to become the world's largest wooden construction project, with an investment of approximately $1.25 billion. The development will feature homes, offices, and schools built primarily from cross-laminated timber, a material with significantly lower carbon emissions than traditional steel and concrete. The project aims to showcase sustainable urban development and help its developer, Atrium Ljungberg, reach near-zero construction emissions by 2030. Architects believe that beyond sustainability, the visible wooden structures will create a more pleasing aesthetic and a stronger connection to nature for residents.</p>
