          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is opposing the Menendez brothers' defense team's request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case. The defense argued the DA's office showed bias and violated Marsy's Law. Bonta's office stated the defense failed to provide evidence meeting the stringent standards for recusal, while the DA's office called the move a "drastic and desperate step." The Menendez brothers are seeking resentencing, claiming they were unfairly convicted for murdering their parents due to excluded evidence of alleged sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are collaborating with police and a charity through the Night Light initiative to safeguard at-risk children. These women provide crucial information about child exploitation, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of child sexual abusers. In one instance, a sex worker reported a client who asked her to role-play as a primary school-aged girl, which led to the discovery of his abuse of his own daughter. The Night Light team also works to identify and support underage girls at risk of exploitation, offering them a safe path off the streets.</p>

          <p>Asia‚Äôs largest economies have approved a new rapid financing mechanism using regional currencies, including the Chinese yuan, signaling a potential shift away from reliance on the US dollar. This move aims to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by President Trump‚Äôs global tariff war. The initiative is part of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilatalisation (CMIM), a currency swap arrangement among ASEAN members, China, Japan, and South Korea. This may represent a long-term trend towards a regional monetary system that reduces dependence on the dollar and gives China a more prominent role.</p>

This decision marks the fifth time since 2018 that the Preakness will proceed without a horse having a shot at the Triple Crown.
