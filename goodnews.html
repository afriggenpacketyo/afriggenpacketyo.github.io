          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting Brazil's President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and other Latin American officials in Beijing to strengthen ties, signaling China's intent to maintain influence in the region. This comes as the U.S. seeks closer alignment with Latin American countries, raising concerns about a "new Monroe Doctrine." Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power and a geopolitical counterweight to U.S. influence. While trade between China and Latin America has surged, some countries are wary of Chinese exporters flooding their markets, leading to protectionist measures.</p>

          <p>Bridgend council in Wales faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that included a slide stating, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claimed it was part of a draft version that was never shown to children and was removed following feedback. Experts and politicians raised concerns about why such content was ever considered appropriate, especially given that non-fatal strangulation is a criminal offense. The Welsh government emphasized that non-fatal strangulation is dangerous and illegal, and resources provided to schools make this clear.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has launched a fresh leadership bid with Ellie Chowns, joining deputy leader Zack Polanski in the contest. Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its most ambitious chapter, focusing on national politics in Westminster and winning power across the country. Polanski emphasizes building a "mass movement" to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. The Greens achieved their best-ever result in the 2024 general election, winning seats in four constituencies, and increased their number of councillors for the eighth consecutive year.</p>

          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging the country's increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic, through widespread protests and demonstrations. Sparked by a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in years, reaching deep into Serbian society. Despite government attempts to quell the unrest, including offering loans to young people, the protests continue to gain momentum. The movement is characterized by its horizontal decision-making and solidarity, setting an example for the world.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. After the theft, a South Korean temple filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

The White House called it a "trade deal" but gave no further details. The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes of easing trade tensions and averting a global recession.</p>
