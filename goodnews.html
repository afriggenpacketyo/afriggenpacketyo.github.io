        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that in the current multipolar world, major powers must choose between rigid alliances leading to conflict or managed accommodation, drawing parallels to the 19th century's German emergence and the 1970s' Nixon-Zhou Enlai détente. The article highlights two distinguishing factors in today's competition: nuclear weapons making total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture. It emphasizes that economic fundamentals have already established a multipolar order, and patient statecraft is crucial to avoid catastrophic miscalculation, contrasting historical failures with the potential for modern adaptation. The author suggests that despite current tensions, global interconnectedness provides strong incentives for cooperation and stability.</p>

          <p>Lara Trump, host of "My View with Lara Trump," has sparked debate by revealing her "no-wait-at-the-gate" travel strategy, aiming to arrive at the airport just as her boarding zone is called. She asserts this method maximizes personal time, avoiding unnecessary waiting at the airport, and relies on airline apps and Google flight tracking to monitor delays. While the TSA recommends arriving two to three hours before flights, Trump, who adopted this hack during campaign travel, emphasizes efficiency. The article notes that her approach has garnered mixed reactions online, with some travelers agreeing with the time-saving benefits while others express anxiety over such last-minute arrivals, highlighting a common point of contention among air passengers.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries visited Black churches in Los Angeles to campaign for California's Proposition 50, a redistricting effort aimed at adding five or six Democratic representatives. Amid a federal government shutdown, Jeffries linked the ballot measure to countering Republican obstruction and gerrymandering efforts nationwide. The article highlights the historical role of First African Methodist Episcopal Church as a civil rights bastion and Jeffries's message of ensuring a level playing field. Proposition 50, proposed by Governor Newsom, would temporarily depose the state's independent redistricting commission to redraw maps, a move criticized by California Republicans as a "big scam."</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting hundreds of Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals in California and Hawaii has ended, with the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) announcing renewed momentum for bargaining.

The union cites new Joint Commission standards recognizing adequate staffing as a patient safety mandate, while Kaiser maintains that wages are the primary contention, arguing its employees already earn above-market rates and that the company must keep healthcare affordable.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, hosting "Saturday Night Live," used her appearance to subtly address public perceptions of her persona and sexuality. In a QVC sketch, her character innocently promoted a pillow that strikingly resembled female genitalia, a clear nod to reactions to her bawdy live performances and suggestive album art. The article highlights Carpenter's coy projection of innocence and her character's dismissal of male callers' raunchy questions, suggesting the problem lies in how people interpret her work. Through her monologue and a "girlboss" sketch, Carpenter also directly challenged critics, particularly other women, who are overly concerned with her every move, implying she is "in on the joke."</p>
