          <p>As part of its upcoming separation from parent company Comcast's NBCUniversal, the MSNBC cable news network will be renamed My Source News Opinion World, or MS Now. The change, announced in an internal memo, aims to create a distinct identity for the network as it builds its own independent newsgathering operation. All branding associated with NBC, including the iconic peacock logo, will be removed from MS Now and other channels under the new parent company, Versant. The network's leadership has assured employees that its core focus and commitment to its work will remain unchanged despite the rebranding.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend is highlighting the long-standing practice of "sorority cold rooms" at various U.S. universities. These are large, communal sleeping dormitories, often in basements or attics, kept at a cool temperature with strict rules about noise and light to ensure a good night's sleep for many members. While some social media users praise the setup for providing a quiet and dark sleeping environment, others raise concerns about the spread of illness and potential fire safety hazards. The trend has brought attention to a unique aspect of Greek life that has existed for decades at schools like Florida State and Purdue University.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has agreed to a deal to sign 19-year-old winger Ben Doak from Liverpool for an initial fee of £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. The Scottish international, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is expected to complete his medical and transfer within 24 hours. The move is seen as an opportunity for Doak to gain more first-team football experience. This sale contributes to a profitable summer for Liverpool, which has generated significant funds from selling several 'homegrown' or development players, boosting its position regarding profit and sustainability rules.</p>

          <h2>Kenyan Study Finds Direct Cash Payments Significantly Reduce Infant Mortality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 10:08:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya has revealed that providing no-strings-attached cash payments of $1,000 to low-income households can be as effective as traditional medical interventions in saving infants' lives. Published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the report found that cash transfers cut mortality in children under five by about 45%, a reduction on par with vaccines. The researchers suggest the money enables families to overcome financial barriers to accessing healthcare, such as transportation and service fees, leading to more hospital deliveries. The study also found improvements in nutrition and reduced physical labor for pregnant mothers.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has added over 6,000 new words this year, including slang terms like "skibidi" and "tradwife" that have been popularized by internet culture. "Skibidi" is a gibberish term from a viral YouTube series, while "tradwife" refers to a traditional wife who documents her domestic life on social media. Other new entries reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device to feign activity while working remotely, and composite terms like "broligarchy," describing powerful male tech leaders. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting relevance in the English language.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk saw a significant increase after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a progressive liver disease known as MASH. This approval marks Wegovy as the first GLP-1 class medication authorized for this condition, expanding its applications beyond weight loss and diabetes. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed a superior improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. The company also announced it would reduce the cost of its diabetes drug, Ozempic, for cash-paying patients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season revealed key tactical developments, including defensive vulnerabilities for Arne Slot's new-look Liverpool. The team appeared susceptible to counter-attacks against Bournemouth, conceding as many goals from fast breaks in one game as they did all of last season, suggesting a need to adjust the positioning of their full-backs. Meanwhile, Manchester City has seemingly found a solution to playing without the injured Rodri, maintaining their dominance. In contrast, Arsenal's shift towards a more direct, counter-attacking style proved less effective against Manchester United, indicating a need to balance their new approach with their established possession-based game.</p>

          <p>While some reports have suggested Hurricane Erin could bring a "600-mile wall of rain" to the UK, BBC meteorologists clarify this is a misinterpretation. The remnants of the storm, currently a Category 4 hurricane off the U.S. coast, are expected to move across the Atlantic and arrive west of the UK as a typical low-pressure system next week. This may bring some unsettled and windy weather, but the idea of a continuous sheet of rain is physically impossible. For the upcoming bank holiday weekend, the UK is expected to experience largely settled and dry weather due to a high-pressure system.</p>

          <p>Mallory Contois, the vice president of growth at the startup Maven, attributes much of her career success to the practice of sending ambitious cold emails. She advises sending one "scary email" per week to connect with people or companies outside one's immediate network, a habit that landed her her current role after she pitched herself to the company. Contois emphasizes making the request as easy as possible for the recipient, keeping the message short, and not being afraid to show genuine passion. She argues that this low-risk, high-reward strategy can lead to astronomical career growth by creating opportunities that would not otherwise exist.</p>

          <p>China's market for public cloud services supporting artificial intelligence grew by 55% in 2024, reaching a value of $2.7 billion, according to a report from consultancy IDC. The surge was driven by massive demand for training and applying large language models, a shift from previous years where demand was focused on traditional AI applications like computer vision. Tech giants Baidu and Alibaba Group Holding were the dominant players, each capturing roughly 25% of the market share. The report notes that the industry is now evolving towards more autonomous, agentic AI, which is expected to continue fueling demand for cloud services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is spearheading a significant push for overseas investment, as companies seek to escape intense competition and overcapacity in the domestic market. A Rhodium Group report indicates that in 2024, for the first time, Chinese EV firms invested more abroad than at home, a major shift for a traditionally inward-focused sector. This move aligns with the government's strategy to build an offshore economic presence. At home, EV assembly plants were operating at less than 50% capacity in 2023, pushing companies to explore international markets despite the higher costs and risks involved.

          <p>A new generation of authors is transforming the disability memoir genre, moving away from traditional narratives of overcoming adversity or activist calls to action. Books like Raymond Antrobus’s "The Quiet Ear" and Andrew Leland’s "The Country of the Blind" present more ambivalent and intellectually rigorous accounts of living with impairment. These works explore the contradictions and nuances of disabled identity, treating it as a subject worthy of deep literary analysis rather than a tool for inspiration. By focusing on their internal experiences and wrestling with complex questions, these writers challenge readers' assumptions and present a more authentic portrayal of disability.</p>

In this innovative arrangement, Google and Kairos will bear the financial risk of construction, while TVA guarantees revenue through a power purchase agreement, protecting consumers from initial costs.
