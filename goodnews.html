          <p>The European Commission has issued a preliminary finding that Meta and TikTok have violated transparency rules under the landmark Digital Services Act (DSA). The tech giants are accused of failing to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, a key requirement for scrutinizing the platforms' societal impact. Meta was also cited for not providing simple mechanisms for users to report illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. If the findings are upheld, the companies could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>This opinion article frames the recent jewel heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris not as a national tragedy, but as a thrilling and almost comical caper. The author argues that the non-violent theft, which involved escaping on mopeds and leaving behind tools, is a gift to the world, providing a sense of fun and adventure. The piece contrasts this event with more violent crimes, suggesting that the heist has made the stolen jewels more famous than they ever were in the museum and that no one was physically harmed in the process.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached a historic high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a report from Hedge Fund Research. This growth was driven by the largest quarterly net asset inflow from investors in 18 years, combined with strong positive trading gains. The surge in capital is attributed to factors like increased M&A activity, successful investments in technology and AI, and expectations of lower interest rates. Analysts suggest that institutions will likely continue to increase allocations to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), noting that top accounts are offering returns that outpace the current rate of inflation. While national averages for CD yields vary by term, the most competitive rates are typically found at online banks, which have lower overhead costs. The report also highlights an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term ones. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on these high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

This is the first impact crater to be identified in southern China. Researchers estimate that the energy released by the impact was equivalent to about 600,000 tonnes of TNT, or roughly 40 atomic bombs. The discovery provides new insights into the Earth's geological history and the potential for cosmic events to shape the planet's surface.</p>

          <p>Philip Pullman's new trilogy, *The Book of Dust*, a companion to his famous *His Dark Materials* series, delves into the concept of dangerous books and ideas. The article connects this theme to the real-world controversy and banning campaigns that targeted Pullman's original work for its anti-religious themes. In the new series, the central conflict involves characters who become estranged from their souls after falling under the influence of books preaching moral relativism. This narrative serves as Pullman's commentary on modern culture wars, suggesting that while ideas can be dangerous, the solution is not censorship but engagement with better stories.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption case filed against the country's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP). The lawsuit sought to annul the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The judge ruled that the case lacked merit and had "no basis," a decision met with applause in the courtroom. CHP officials have maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition.</p>

The species, once common in southeast Texas, has declined by over 90% due to habitat loss and other threats. Researchers are now playing matchmaker, using hormone injections and in-vitro fertilization to breed the toads in captivity. The resulting eggs and toadlets are then released into protected habitats on private land, part of a broader conservation strategy involving willing landowners to restore the species in the wild.</p>
