          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML aims to alleviate investor concerns about its 2026 growth trajectory, despite forecasting a substantial decline in sales to China next year. The company maintained its 2025 annual sales growth forecast of around 15% and a 52% gross margin, driven by the ongoing AI boom which fueled €5.4 billion in third-quarter orders. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged geopolitical uncertainties but expressed confidence in AI's value creation for their technology roadmap. Analysts remain bullish on ASML, citing AI chip foundry expansion and increased semiconductor manufacturing, though the potential for further U.S. restrictions on China remains a concern.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed that veterinary practices be mandated to publish price lists and disclose ownership by larger groups. This recommendation follows a CMA investigation that found pet owners pay 16.6% more at large group-owned vets, attributing soaring prices—up 63% in seven years—to a lack of competition. The CMA's provisional findings also suggest price caps on medicines and a ban on bonuses tied to specific treatments. The regulator argues the current system, established in 1966, fails to regulate the businesses owning most practices, leading to insufficient transparency for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has proven relentless in the postseason, notably with significant contributions from the bottom half of their batting order. In Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, the sixth through ninth hitters combined for seven hits, three runs, and three RBIs, securing a 2-0 series lead. This trend has been consistent throughout the playoffs, with these hitters boasting a .302/.391/.448 slash line and 35 hits in eight games, outperforming the top five. Players like Kiké Hernández and Andy Pages have delivered crucial hits, demonstrating the team's depth and collective confidence in securing victories. The team's current score is indeed high.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear Alex Jones' appeal, thereby upholding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones, the Infowars host, had argued that the default judgment against him, issued without a trial on the merits, was improper. The justices' decision, made without requiring a response from the Sandy Hook families, reinforces accountability for his harmful rhetoric. Despite Jones' claims of insufficient funds and ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, the families' lawyer expressed readiness to enforce the verdict, marking a significant legal victory for the victims.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Wednesday, diverging from Wall Street's downturn amidst a rekindled US-China trade feud. President Trump criticized China for not buying soybeans and threatened "retribution," including a cooking oil embargo. Despite these geopolitical strains, which keep volatility high, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi notably rose. China's consumer prices, however, fell more than expected in September, signaling sluggish domestic demand. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at nearing an end to bond-holding reductions and potential interest rate cuts also influenced market sentiment, providing a mixed economic backdrop.

          <p>The US government, in a joint operation with the UK, has seized over $14 billion in Bitcoin and charged Chen Zhi, founder of Cambodia's Prince Group, with masterminding a vast cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering scheme. Zhi, a UK and Cambodian national, allegedly operated a "sprawling cyber-fraud empire" involving forced labor camps where victims were coerced into online scams. UK authorities have frozen assets, including 19 London properties. This marks one of the largest financial takedowns in history, highlighting international efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations that exploit vulnerable individuals through sophisticated digital schemes.</p>

          <p>The USA men's soccer team secured a 2-1 comeback victory against Australia in a friendly match, with striker Haji Wright scoring two goals. Captain Christian Pulisic was forced off early with a lower leg injury after several heavy challenges from the physical Socceroos. Despite Australia scoring first, the USA controlled possession and created more chances, demonstrating improved performances under manager Mauricio Pochettino. The match also saw tensions flare with multiple fouls and a scuffle, reflecting the competitive nature of the game. This win marks a positive step for the USA as they prepare for next year’s World Cup, while denying Australia a potential rankings boost. The team's score is indeed high.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly lambasted Time magazine's latest cover photo, calling it "the Worst of All Time" despite a "relatively good story" inside about his role in the Gaza ceasefire. Trump complained on Truth Social that the image, taken from below with sunlight behind him, made his hair "disappear" and created a "floating crown" effect. His long-standing obsession with Time covers is well-documented, including previous instances of displaying mocked-up versions. The article explores the photographic choices, with a Guardian Australia picture editor suggesting the angle aimed for a sense of grandeur and contemplation, but ultimately proved unflattering, much to Trump's dismay.</p>

          <p>A TV advertisement by Red Tractor, a major UK certifier of farm products, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exaggerating its environmental benefits. The ASA found "insufficient evidence" that Red Tractor farms consistently comply with basic environmental laws, ruling the ad misleading. Environmental group River Action, which filed the complaint, accused the scheme of "greenwashing" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. Red Tractor, however, called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is animal welfare and food safety, not environmental standards, which it leaves to the Environment Agency.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed several significant bills aimed at making AI and social media platforms safer for minors. New laws include requiring AI chatbots to incorporate guardrails against self-harm discussions and to alert minors they are interacting with AI every three hours. Other legislation removes a civil legal defense for AI developers regarding harm caused by their products, increases penalties for nonconsensual "deepfake" pornography, and mandates warning labels on social media for minors. These measures reflect a proactive approach by California to address the mental health impacts and safety risks technology poses to young people.</p>
