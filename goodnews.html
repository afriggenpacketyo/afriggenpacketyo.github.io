Elvira playfully offered beauty advice to the Duchess of Sussex on social media, posting a screenshot of a news headline about Markle's joke.

          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, leading authorities to investigate possible arson at an electrical substation near Cannes. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, disrupting traffic lights and train service, and causing shops to close. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the closing ceremony, would proceed as planned, with the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply. The Palme d'Or was later awarded to Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, a move interpreted as a demonstration of Canada's sovereignty and independence against perceived threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. This invitation is significant as it marks a rare occasion, with the last British monarch delivering Canada's throne speech in 1977 and opening a new session of parliament in 1957. Carney's decision signals a more supportive stance towards the Crown, contrasting with previous Liberal leaders, and comes at a time when Trump has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs that threaten its economic stability. While the Canadian population is largely indifferent to the British monarchy, the invitation underscores Canada's unique traditions and separation from the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and asserting his role in rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed a shift in foreign policy away from nation-building, emphasizing the military's core mission of crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. Trump also highlighted the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies and touted a new peacetime recruiting record, though records indicate enlistments began rebounding before his administration. The speech follows Vice President Vance's emphasis on ending forever wars, and West Point is now complying with the administration's ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled the remainder of his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. The 76-year-old musician made the announcement on social media, expressing his sincere apology to fans and noting that his doctors advised him against performing. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, leading to problems with walking, cognitive symptoms, and urinary incontinence, but is often misdiagnosed as normal signs of aging or other conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to the stage in the future, and doctors say that going public with his diagnosis could help others get the help they need sooner.</p>

          <p>Young men in the U.S. are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, unapologetic form of masculinity, often rejecting modern American societal norms. These churches, like the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), attract converts seeking a sense of traditional values and a rejection of what they perceive as over-feminization in Western culture. Leaders like Father Moses McPherson champion a version of masculinity that emphasizes physical strength, traditional gender roles, and a rejection of contraception. The trend reflects broader political shifts and a growing interest in Russia as a bastion of traditional Christianity.</p>

The new rules are part of a broader government effort to address the housing crisis and build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.

          <p>Sam Fender capped off Saturday at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool with a performance featuring confetti, fireworks, and crowd favorites like Seventeen Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles. Despite some technical issues, Fender's set was well-received by fans, many of whom wore Newcastle United kits. The day also included a surprise set from Ed Sheeran on the New Music Stage, as well as performances by Sugababes, Blossoms, and Wolf Alice. The event is expected to draw over 100,000 fans to Liverpool, with Mumford & Sons headlining on Sunday evening.</p>
