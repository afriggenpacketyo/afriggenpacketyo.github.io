          <p>Tom Hartley, a 26-year-old spinner, is set to return to the England cricket team for the one-day international series against the West Indies, balancing his cricket career with managing his family's garden center. Hartley's daily routine involves waking up early to manage the nursery, a sixth-generation family business, before dedicating time to cricket. He believes the garden center work helps him stay grounded and reduces pressure on the field, providing a sense of stability regardless of his performance in cricket. Hartley's father, a former European champion, also supports him in managing the business.</p>

          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of the government's stockpiled rice through direct contracts, following the agriculture minister's announcement of a revised scheme to combat soaring rice prices. The amount requested accounts for over 30% of the 300,000 tons designated for release through direct sales, bypassing the auction system previously used. Retailers like Don Quijote, Rakuten Group Inc., and Aeon Co. plan to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms starting in early June to meet the government's price target. The government is also considering expanding eligibility to smaller supermarkets and rice shops to ensure stable food supply and alleviate public anxiety over rising prices.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. Rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on a tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations, driven by DNA methylation changes. This research supports the long-dismissed theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study positions Lamarckism as a potential force in evolution, requiring modern biology to reconcile epigenetics with core evolutionary principles.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil collected from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the grounds of government buildings, including the prime minister's office, to demonstrate its safety. This initiative aims to dispel public concerns and show that the soil, which retains low-level radioactivity, is suitable for public works projects. The soil will be used in flowerbeds and for other purposes on government office grounds, marking the first time it has been repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture. However, the plan faces potential public opposition due to lingering safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen has spoken for the first time about his decision to donate $20,000 to the families of striking miners in the UK during a 1985 concert in Newcastle. Springsteen, whose parents were working-class, said he had been following news coverage of the strike and felt it was a good thing to do. The cheque was handed to women running support groups, who described Springsteen as a "hero" for his act of generosity. The story is featured in a forthcoming BBC documentary.</p>
