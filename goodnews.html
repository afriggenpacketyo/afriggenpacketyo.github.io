          <p>An Ohio lawmaker has proposed House Bill 469, a measure aimed at preventing artificial intelligence systems from being granted legal personhood. The bill explicitly defines AI as "nonsentient entities," which would prohibit them from owning property, holding executive roles, or marrying humans. The legislation seeks to establish clear legal guardrails to ensure humans remain in control and are held responsible for the actions of AI systems as the technology becomes more advanced.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche has stated that winning games is more important than adhering to a specific style of play. His hiring comes after the brief tenure of Ange Postecoglou, whose expansive, attacking approach failed to produce results. Dyche, known for his pragmatic philosophy, emphasized the need to play "effective football" to stabilize the club, which is currently in the Premier League's relegation zone after a successful previous season.</p>

          <p>Claire-Louise Bennett's third book, "Big Kiss, Bye-Bye," delves into the contemporary anxieties surrounding relationships between men and women, a phenomenon sometimes termed "heteropessimism." The novel follows its unnamed narrator through the aftermath of a breakup, using inventive, meandering prose to explore intimacy, loneliness, and the intersection of personal experience with broader sociopolitical trends. This article suggests the book offers a subtle counterargument to gender pessimism by grounding its analysis in the specific, tangible reality of individual connections.</p>

          <p>Amid rising bankruptcy inquiries, this article clarifies a common misconception about Chapter 13 bankruptcy, explaining that it does not require filers to surrender all of their income. Instead, individuals create a three-to-five-year repayment plan using only their "disposable income," which is the amount left after covering reasonable and necessary living expenses. This process allows people with regular income to catch up on debts like mortgages while maintaining a basic standard of living, offering a structured path to financial stability.</p>
