Alex Rootes, who leads the UK's Rothera research base, conveyed it was an honor to have their work recognized in a difficult part of the world to operate. The broadcast is part of the traditional Midwinter celebrations for scientists at isolated bases, providing a vital boost to their mental health during the dark winter months.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, while President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with the school. The conflict stems from the administration's claims that Harvard failed to address campus antisemitism, leading to threats of cutting off access to the student visa system. Trump also issued an order barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard, though the judge's ruling did not address this order. The battle could have significant consequences for Harvard, where a quarter of students are from outside the United States.</p>

The bill now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports such bans. If enacted, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue that the bill is too weak and does not address possession of assault weapons, while supporters say it brings Rhode Island in line with neighboring states and creates an enforceable ban on sales.</p>
