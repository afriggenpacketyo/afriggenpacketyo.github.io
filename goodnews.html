        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black sees Europe aiming for its first away victory since 2012, with bookmakers slightly favoring the home US side. Achieving fast starts in the opening foursomes is deemed crucial, as past events indicate early leads often dictate the overall outcome of the competition. European captain Luke Donald, leading an experienced and settled team, faces American captain Keegan Bradley, whose opening speech fumble highlighted Europe's advantage in playing experience. The notoriously boisterous New York crowd and the anticipated presence of former President Donald Trump are also expected to significantly influence the electric atmosphere and players' performances throughout the event.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and outgoing Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian have mutually agreed that disputes in the South China Sea should not define their broader bilateral relationship. During Ambassador Huang's farewell call, President Marcos emphasized the importance of fostering deeper trade relations, people-to-people interactions, and cultural exchanges between the two nations. The Chinese embassy echoed this sentiment, expressing a desire for China-Philippines relations to return to a positive and constructive trajectory. This diplomatic language mirrors a joint statement from Marcos's 2023 visit to China, signaling a concerted effort to prioritize broader cooperation over maritime disagreements.</p>

          <p>This article chronicles the remarkable journey of rugby star Ellie Kildunne, from improvising a club name at a U15 trial to becoming World Rugby's player of the year. Kildunne, who excelled in both rugby league and union as the only girl on the pitch, developed a fierce drive to prove herself against preconceptions. Her career highlights include an England debut at 18 and scoring 14 tries in nine Tests in 2024, earning widespread fandom.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 01:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since early April, effectively shifting it out of the takeover spotlight it occupied months prior. This improved market sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership change, significant progress on its cost-cutting program, and a string of recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth to drive shareholder value, while rival Shell previously denied reports of acquisition talks. Analysts note the selection of a new chair with a track record of successful turnarounds as a significant catalyst, alongside stronger second-quarter results and promising new oil and gas finds.

He recalled hotels with unexpected fireworks displays at midnight and a Sunderland dressing room that was once flooded by leaking toilets, dousing players in their clothes. Rooney also described the extreme temperature variations in opposing team dressing rooms, like Chelsea's being too hot and Anfield's being freezing, suggesting deliberate manipulation. He recounted the emotional difficulty of returning to play at Goodison Park against his former club, Everton, a match his father chose not to attend due to anticipated fan hostility.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart Welcomes Drop in Labubu Toy Resale Prices, Prioritizing Accessibility</h2>

          <p>The popular monster toy Labubu, known for commanding massive resale markups, is now experiencing a significant drop in its secondary market prices, a development welcomed by its creator, Chinese company Pop Mart. The company stated that its products are intended for art appreciation, not speculative profit, and that an unsustainable resale model alienates genuine customers. Pop Mart has substantially increased production to meet demand and combat scalping, now churning out 30 million plush toys monthly. Analysts suggest this pivot towards accessibility aims for a more sustainable business model, moving beyond the "one-hit wonder" risk and expanding internationally to solidify its market position.

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, clarified that pregnant women should take Tylenol if advised by a doctor, especially for high fevers, despite President Trump's recent comments on a potential autism link. While FDA Commissioner Marty Makary noted an "association" in studies, a causal relationship is not established, and acetaminophen remains the safest option for fevers during pregnancy. Medical experts warn against avoiding Tylenol, fearing women might turn to unsafe alternatives, emphasizing that the overwhelming evidence does not show causation for autism. Oz stressed transparency but advised caution for self-medication without consulting a physician.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks clinched their eighth consecutive win against the Arizona Cardinals with a dramatic 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired, securing a 23-20 victory. The Seahawks initially squandered a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, allowing the Cardinals to tie the game with just 33 seconds remaining. However, a crucial penalty on the ensuing kickoff and a timely 22-yard pass from Sam Darnold to Jaxon Smith-Njigba quickly moved Seattle into field-goal range. Despite some defensive lapses in closing out the game, Seattle's offense, led by Darnold, ultimately secured a hard-fought and thrilling win on the final play.</p>

In a recent interview, he affirmed that Ukraine would hold elections during a ceasefire, despite martial law currently prohibiting them. Zelenskyy, first elected in 2019, emphasized his deep commitment to his country during this profoundly difficult period. His five-year term would have ended in May 2024, but the ongoing full-scale invasion has necessitated his continued leadership beyond the original mandate.</p>

Ganguly identifies India as a leader in building AI-native apps, expecting them to become market leaders globally. While acknowledging a "frothy" market, he believes the long-term impact of AI will reshape industries and drive innovation, despite the potential for overvaluation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged the illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books to train chatbots. The agreement will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per covered book, though it explicitly excludes future works. While the judge previously ruled that AI training itself constitutes transformative fair use, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired the copyrighted materials. The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers hailed the settlement as a "milestone," signaling to AI companies that copyright infringement will incur a steep price and will push towards legal licensing of content.</p>
