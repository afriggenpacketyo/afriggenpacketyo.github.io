          <p>Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa executed a remarkable behind-the-back flip to wide receiver Malik Washington during a touchdown drive against the New York Jets. The play, which gained nine yards and a first down, quickly went viral on social media, showcasing Tagovailoa's calm and collected performance. He later completed the drive with a touchdown pass to Darren Waller, his first since returning from retirement. The Dolphins led 10-3 at halftime in the Monday night game.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump after his account was banned following the January 6th Capitol riot. The settlement, which does not admit liability, allocates $22 million to a trust for Washington D.C.'s National Mall and a White House ballroom, with the remainder going to other parties. This marks the third tech firm, after Meta and X, to settle with Trump over perceived online muzzling. Trump's YouTube account was reinstated in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have unveiled a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and Hamas having no future role in Gaza's governance. While leaving the door open for a Palestinian state, the plan outlines a temporary technocratic committee overseen by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. Trump warned of full US backing for Israel to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects the deal.</p>

          <p>The NFL's announcement of Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner has ignited a "culture war" debate among conservative commentators. Critics express outrage over the choice of a predominantly Spanish-language artist who has endorsed Kamala Harris and decried immigration sweeps. This article highlights the predictable backlash, with some accusing the NFL of political motivations rather than selecting a globally popular artist. It also notes previous controversies surrounding politically charged halftime performances and the lack of popular MAGA-promoting artists suitable for such a platform.</p>

          <p>An Oregon couple and their friends faced potential loss of thousands in federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits due to their car dealership's failure to file necessary IRS paperwork. The federal EV credit, set to expire soon, has driven a rush of buyers, but this oversight highlights a significant consumer protection issue. While both couples eventually secured their $7,500 credits after persistent follow-up, the incident underscores the importance for buyers to diligently verify all paperwork. The National Auto Dealers Association had issued a reminder to dealerships about these crucial filings.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, advising investors to "keep calm and carry on." He notes that past shutdowns haven't shown a clear negative trend for stocks, distinguishing it from a debt ceiling default. Cramer's primary concern is the potential delay in releasing vital economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. However, he acknowledges the severe impact on furloughed federal workers and the broader economy if the shutdown is prolonged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to curb the non-ferrous metals sector, projecting a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary metals this year. The focus shifts from production volume to optimizing industrial structure, aiming for an average annual growth rate of 5% in value-added output. The plan also prioritizes advancing exploration of critical metals like copper and lithium, developing ultra-pure materials, and enhancing recycling efforts. This move addresses cutthroat competition and depressed processing fees that have squeezed smelter margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey shared that he had an eight-year period of short conversations with his mother, Kay, due to her tendency to share personal information with the media. This "hiatus" began after she gave a tour of his childhood home without his consent. McConaughey explained that he withheld "anything of substance" during their weekly calls because her love of spreading news had eroded his trust. The actor eventually reconciled with his mother and now encourages her to speak freely, even co-starring with her and his son in an upcoming film.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is reportedly considering fielding stealthy flying-wing aircraft, potentially B-21 Raider variants or new platforms, to serve as "arsenal planes" loaded with "dozens" of air-to-air missiles. This concept aims to supplement or replace Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones in high-intensity conflicts, particularly with China in the Indo-Pacific. These arsenal planes would provide extensive "magazine depth" for crewed fighters, launching long-range missiles at targets designated by other aircraft. The study is in early stages, exploring various design and production options to enhance air superiority.</p>
