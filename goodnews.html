          <p>President Donald Trump joined world leaders in Egypt to sign a Gaza peace deal following Hamas's release of all living hostages. The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" outlines commitments to protect human rights, guarantee security, and resolve disputes through diplomacy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent due to a Jewish holiday, though he and Trump praised each other beforehand. Trump declared a "new dawn in the Middle East," emphasizing the rebuilding of Gaza and urging Iran to work towards a peace deal. The agreement marks a turning point for the region, but the path to lasting peace remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for the 11th time, marking another test flight in the development of the Mars-bound spacecraft. The booster made a controlled entry into the Gulf, and the spacecraft descended into the Indian Ocean, with no recovery planned. This test flight included more maneuvering for the spacecraft, with a series of tests planned during its entry over the Indian Ocean. NASA needs the Starship to land astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade, and SpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free law targeting distracted drivers, with a first offense costing $150. The law was prompted by the death of Randall Siddens, who was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. The Missouri Department of Transportation aims to identify distracted driving hot spots using telematics data gathered anonymously from smartphones and vehicles. This data reveals that distracted driving may be more prevalent than indicated by police crash reports, with authorities hoping to increase educational programs and law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas. The goal is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by distracted driving.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill to increase the pay of incarcerated firefighters from approximately $1 per hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This legislation, Assembly Bill 247, takes effect immediately and allocates $10 million for the wage increase. Prison fire crews are a crucial part of the state’s effort to combat wildfires, performing tasks such as clearing brush and digging containment lines. The issue of low wages for prisoners battling fires has gained traction as a social justice cause in recent years, with this bill marking a significant step towards fair compensation.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. More aid is flowing into Gaza, and Israeli troops have partially pulled back, marking crucial steps in the peace process. World leaders, including Trump, met in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future and the broader Middle East, but the situation remains fragile. Negotiations over postwar governance, disarmament, and Palestinian statehood are expected to be challenging, with potential for renewed conflict if demands are not met.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 749, which establishes a commission to study inequalities in youth sports. The commission will examine whether a new state board or department is needed to improve access to sports regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or location. Critics argue that the bill is intended to support transgender athletes, while supporters focus on its potential racial impact. The legislation directs the state public health officer to convene the commission, which will consist of members appointed by the governor and the legislature.</p>

Despite these challenges, Trump expressed confidence in the ceasefire, signaling that talks on the next steps of the plan have already begun.</p>

          <p>San Cha, an L.A.-based musician and composer, is premiering her experimental opera “Inebria me” at REDCAT. The opera expands on her 2019 ranchera fusion album and tells the story of Dolores, a bride whose jealousy turns deadly, and Esperanza, a genderless spirit. San Cha draws inspiration from telenovelas, infusing the classic narrative structure with a queer twist. She aims to blend queerness with religious aspects, creating a visually arresting and thought-provoking work that explores themes of sin and guilt.</p>

However, the UK government remains opposed to another independence referendum, presenting a challenge for the SNP's goals.</p>
