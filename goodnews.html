          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter is said to address the plight of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and forcibly transferred to Russia during the war. This issue is a significant point of international concern, with Putin facing an indictment from the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in the abductions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy later expressed his gratitude to the First Lady for her efforts on this humanitarian issue.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes reached new record highs this week, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected consumer price index report for July. This data initially boosted expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. However, momentum slowed later in the week after the producer price index showed wholesale inflation rising more than anticipated. Despite the mixed signals, market odds for a rate cut remain high, reflecting continued confidence in the economic outlook (not investment advice).</p>

The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included the Princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Sources suggest the move represents a "fresh start" and an opportunity to create a long-term family home away from some difficult memories. The couple will fund the move privately and continue to prioritize their family's privacy without live-in staff.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be constructed in just one week, offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to addressing the affordable housing crisis. The project provides residents with private, secure spaces to stabilize their lives and rebuild.</p>

          <p>A $177 million settlement has been proposed to compensate millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches in 2024. These breaches exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, for up to 73 million current and former account holders.

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over American Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter showdown since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson ran a swift 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and finishing just ahead of Lyles, who clocked in at 9.90 seconds. The race was seen as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who narrowly lost to Lyles for the Olympic gold by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year prior. Both athletes expressed confidence as they look ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area south of Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search operation was launched after he failed to return, and he was eventually located by a drone. A California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A top academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to create a national strategy to accelerate the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves placing large solar arrays in orbit to collect energy, which is then transmitted to Earth using microwaves or lasers, providing a continuous power source unaffected by weather. The scientist, Ge Changchun, warned that China is lagging behind the United States in this field and needs a more coordinated, top-down approach to close the gap and secure a leading position in the future of energy and space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as an alternative to the exhausting and potentially damaging trend of intensive parenting. A lighthouse parent acts as a steady, reliable guide, offering illumination and safety when needed but otherwise allowing their child to navigate their own journey. This approach contrasts with the common parental instinct to immediately solve a child's problems or prevent any struggle. By standing back, parents can foster more confident and resilient children who are better equipped to handle challenges on their own.</p>

          <p>At the conclusion of the Alaska summit press conference, Vladimir Putin surprised observers by inviting Donald Trump to Moscow in English, a language he rarely uses in official settings. While the Russian president is fluent in German and relies on interpreters for English, he is known to have a strong command of the language, which he occasionally uses for brief remarks. This strategic use of language allows him to connect directly when desired, while the use of translators provides time to formulate responses and feign misunderstanding of inconvenient questions, as he did with reporters earlier in the day.</p>

This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously taken from the Tate brothers for unpaid taxes on revenue from their online businesses.

          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar emphasizes the importance of one key morning ritual to ground herself and prevent anxiety: waking up early, no matter what. By getting up when her alarm goes off, she creates a buffer of personal time before the day's demands begin. She uses this extra hour for rejuvenating activities like reading or walking her dog, rather than adhering to a strict, high-pressure routine. This flexible approach allows her to start the day feeling creative and in control, rather than feeling rushed or like she has already failed at a task.</p>
