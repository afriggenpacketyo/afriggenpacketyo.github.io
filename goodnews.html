          <p>Portugal's recent general election, the third in three years, has not yielded a stable government, resulting in another minority government for the center-right Democratic Alliance. The significant increase in support for the hard-right populist party Chega adds to the uncertainty. The election was triggered by a political storm involving Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro's family law firm. Key issues include corruption scandals, rising immigration, and a housing crisis, with Chega advocating for stricter immigration policies. (npr.org)</p>
