          <p>The New York Yankees prevented a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3, following two impressive wins by the Dodgers. Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor start, allowing a season-high in hits and walks, while the Dodgers made defensive and baserunning errors. Ryan Yarbrough, a former Dodger, pitched effectively against his old team, contributing to the Dodgers' offensive struggles. The Dodgers' inconsistent start to the season continues, inviting more scrutiny after this finale flop.</p>

Universities UK found institutions were reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, leading to course cutbacks and closures.</p>
