        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax law, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," has reinstated three key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, providing a significant financial windfall for large technology firms. The law brings back immediate expensing for R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and a more flexible interest deductibility limit. These changes are expected to unlock billions in free cash flow for companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, supporting their massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. While not changing fundamental earnings, the law accelerates deductions and provides greater policy certainty for long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced "study mode," a new feature within ChatGPT designed to assist students with their learning process rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address concerns about academic cheating by prompting users with guiding questions and encouraging them to work through problems step-by-step. Developed in collaboration with educators and students, study mode is intended to improve critical thinking and academic performance. The feature is being rolled out to all ChatGPT users and will be available in the university-focused ChatGPT Edu platform in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" advice column, James Parker addresses a reader who rarely thinks about the past and wonders if they are missing a fundamental human experience. The reader clarifies they don't avoid memories but tend to worry about the future rather than ruminate on past events. Parker, who describes himself as someone who holds onto old grievances, reassures the reader that their ability to let go of the past is a "superpower." He humorously suggests they use this gift to absolve others who are bogged down by guilt and regret, effectively freeing them from their own pasts.</p>

For Apple, partnering with the experienced JPMorgan would bring stability to the program after a period of regulatory scrutiny under Goldman.

Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, developers see a growing opportunity for investment in the sector.

They also leverage debt, borrowing at rates lower than Bitcoin's expected growth to acquire more of the asset.
