          <p>A new official photograph of Queen Camilla has been released by Buckingham Palace to commemorate her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling at her private home in Wiltshire. Dressed in a turquoise print dress, she appears relaxed and in good spirits. The release follows a busy period of public engagements for the Royal Family, including a state visit and Trooping the Colour. The Queen is expected to celebrate her birthday privately this year, following her public duties.</p>

          <h2>Recycled Electric Vehicle Batteries Are Being Repurposed to Power the AI Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative approach to sustainable energy, used electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to power data centers, helping to meet the massive energy demands of the AI boom. Companies like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are creating systems that use these old batteries to store solar energy, providing a reliable and renewable power source. This strategy addresses the growing concern that data centers could consume a significantly larger share of the U.S. electrical grid. The initiative also offers a second life for EV batteries that are no longer optimal for vehicles but still retain significant storage capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled following a 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast. The quake initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. However, authorities later downgraded the alert to an advisory before canceling it altogether, as the shallow depth of the earthquake meant that large, widespread waves were not expected. While the quake was felt across the region, no major damage or injuries have been reported, bringing a sense of relief to residents.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation aimed at preventing thousands of military veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ended a pandemic-era assistance program without a viable replacement. This new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move the missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their loans current. The measure provides a critical safety net and has been praised by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after search teams followed a series of handwritten notes she left behind. The pair became lost after their vehicle's GPS led them down remote roads where they lost their signal. The mother's quick thinking to leave notes, along with her son's use of a whistle to signal for help, proved instrumental in their discovery. Rescuers were able to locate the stranded pair, who were found safe inside their vehicle, highlighting the importance of preparation and resourcefulness in emergencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from using high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. In a social media post, Trump praised the move as "just better," aligning with his administration's health initiatives. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and said details on new offerings would be shared soon. If implemented, the change would make standard American Coke taste more like the popular cane sugar-sweetened version imported from Mexico.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the UK are planning a class-action lawsuit against major property freeholders, alleging they were charged inflated service fees due to secret insurance commissions. The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurance companies, which were then passed on to leaseholders through higher buildings insurance costs. Lawyers argue these commissions are unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. The companies named in the legal letters have denied any wrongdoing and stated they operate within regulatory frameworks.</p>
