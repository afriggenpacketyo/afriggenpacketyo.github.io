          <p>The Parliament of England and Wales is set to debate the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would allow some terminally ill adults the choice to end their lives, after undergoing significant changes. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and revisions, including the removal of the High Court judge requirement, replacing it with a panel of experts. The government also quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. This debate marks a critical juncture in the ongoing discussion surrounding end-of-life care and individual autonomy, with strong opinions from both sides of the political spectrum, where MPs have been given a free vote on the matter. The bill previously cleared its first hurdle by a vote of 330 to 275 back in November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture most of its products in China has created a significant vulnerability for the United States. The article highlights how Apple has trained millions of Chinese workers, transferring technology and know-how, enabling China to advance its own tech industry. McGee argues that China wouldn't be where it is today without Apple's investment and training, which has inadvertently aided the rise of Chinese tech companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. The review notes that while the book is comprehensive, it sometimes delves into excessive detail, yet it persuasively exposes the intertwined relationship between Apple and China, suggesting the exploitation goes both ways.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its jewelry division, as wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainties. The group's Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, experienced double-digit growth. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China. While Richemont faces headwinds such as rising gold prices and currency fluctuations, analysts believe the company's pricing power could offset some of these challenges.</p>

          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features to address allegations of harming users' mental health, particularly that of children. The company is rolling out the meditation feature, aimed at improving sleep quality, which will be triggered during "sleep hours" and turned on by default for users under 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits concerning the platform's impact on young users, with attorneys general alleging TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids.

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study reveals that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines. The study confirms human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago.</p>

Johansson's legal team has taken action against AI image-generating apps for using her voice and likeness in ads.

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets following President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors diversifying away from the U.S. due to tariff shocks. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the future appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>
