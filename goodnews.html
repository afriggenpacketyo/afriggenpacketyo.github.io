          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration's military leaders are actively considering the acquisition of equity stakes in major defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin. This contemplation follows the government's recent investment in Intel and highlights a significant discussion regarding the financial relationship with companies that largely depend on federal contracts, effectively operating as extensions of the U.S. government. Lutnick emphasized that the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense are thoroughly examining the implications of such a strategy. This potential shift could profoundly reshape the economic landscape and operational independence of the defense industry, marking a notable departure in governmental engagement with private sector entities.</p>

          <p>China is gripped by a widespread "blind box" craze, where consumers buy mystery items without knowing the exact contents until after purchase. Pop Mart, a Beijing-based company, has achieved immense success with its Labubu doll, sold exclusively through this format, encouraging repeat purchases for limited editions. This trend, which gained traction during the pandemic as a budget-friendly pick-me-up for young consumers, has drawn concern from the Chinese government. State media has criticized the "irrational consumption" and potential for "addiction" among minors, advocating for stricter regulations to prevent it from becoming a "commercial trap" exploiting children's psychological vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz has been laughing off the "horrendous" haircut he received from his brother just before the US Open, a mishap that led to him shaving his head. The world No. 2 explained that his brother misunderstood with the clippers, necessitating the drastic fix. While some, including fellow player Frances Tiafoe, have described the new look as terrible, Alcaraz remains amused by the public's reactions, noting that his hair grows so fast it will change in days. This lighthearted incident offers a glimpse into the athlete's personality, showing his ability to find humor even in unexpected personal situations during a major tournament.</p>

He is currently designing community engagement for a global artivism conference in Salvador, focusing on how art can serve as "medicine for change" to reverse trauma and empower marginalized communities. Gouveia envisions a world built on enlightened, collaborative dreams, countering fear and division with the power of music, dance, and collective action.</p>

          <p>Kylin Software, a unit of state-owned China Electronics Corp, has unveiled V11, the latest iteration of its operating system, which incorporates advanced AI capabilities to enhance office productivity. A key feature is its expanded compatibility with a diverse array of Chinese-designed and developed integrated circuits from major domestic chip designers like Hygon Information Technology and Loongson Technology. This development underscores China's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency and the creation of a robust domestic hardware and software ecosystem, particularly in light of ongoing tech tensions with the United States. While significant, Microsoft's Windows continues to hold a dominant market share in China.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Billie Jean King, a lifelong advocate for women's rights and equality in sports, discussed the significant strides made while emphasizing the ongoing work required to level the playing field. King highlighted historical achievements, such as her "Battle of the Sexes" victory and lobbying for equal prize money at the U.S. Open, which made it the first major tournament to do so. She recounted instances where women's advocacy led to tangible changes, like securing financial backing for the WNBA and the creation of the Professional Women's Hockey League. King's ultimate goal remains uniting the men's and women's tennis leagues, seeing aging as an opportunity for continued engagement.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advocate for Rest as the Ultimate Productivity Hack</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts contend that in an era of constant information overload, the most effective productivity hack is rest, as the human brain is not designed for the relentless demands of modern digital life. Kayla Stajkovic, an organizational behavior lecturer, explains that our minds have a limited attentional capacity, which is quickly depleted by continuous screen time, meetings, and multitasking, leading to cognitive overload. This mental exhaustion impairs working memory, decision-making, and job satisfaction. Instead of adopting more complex productivity systems, which can exacerbate the problem, the article advocates for counterintuitive strategies like taking breaks, disengaging from work, and consciously reducing information intake to rejuvenate the mind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace has made an inquiry to Manchester City regarding the availability of defender Manuel Akanji, though no official bid has been submitted yet. Manchester City is reportedly seeking around £15m for the Swiss international, who has not featured in their Premier League games this season. Akanji, 30, joined City in 2022 and was part of their Treble-winning squad, starting the Champions League final. With other clubs, including Turkish champions Galatasaray, also showing interest, and City's manager Pep Guardiola focusing on player departures after significant summer spending, a move for Akanji seems likely as the transfer window approaches its closure.</p>

          <p>Ten years after Angela Merkel's "We can do it" declaration, Germany is assessing the integration of 1.2 million refugees who arrived in 2015-2016, primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. While initial solidarity has shifted to skepticism, data shows positive trends in labor market integration, with employment rates at their highest and unemployment at its lowest for this group. However, significant gender differences in German language acquisition persist. The cost of integration has been substantial, yet the long-term economic benefits are debated. Politically, the mood has changed, with a majority now favoring fewer refugees, and policies have tightened, though some experts believe the integration task has largely succeeded.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Evolutionary biologist Toby Kiers's research reveals that plants and fungi engage in sophisticated, brainless economic interactions, trading resources like phosphorus, nitrogen, and sugars. Challenging the notion of simple sharing, Kiers investigates how these organisms prevent freeloading through "partner choice," sanctioning those that don't provide nutrients. Using quantum-dot nanoparticles and robotic imaging, her team has observed fungi hoarding resources, responding to supply and demand, and saving during plentiful times. This ancient biological market, dating back a billion years, was crucial for plants to colonize land and still significantly impacts global CO2 levels. Kiers suggests that understanding this decentralized decision-making in nature could offer insights for human supply chains and artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Redistricting efforts in Texas and California represent a high-stakes gamble by both Republican and Democratic parties on the future allegiances of Latino voters. Texas Republicans are banking on a continued rightward shift among Latinos to secure new congressional districts, while California Democrats assume Latino loyalty will bolster their candidates in battleground areas. Historically, Latino support for Democrats in California has declined in recent presidential cycles, making the Democratic strategy potentially vulnerable. The article suggests that Latino voters, increasingly diverse and influential, are emerging as America's new swing voters, and their evolving political leanings will determine control of the House of Representatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the rising trend of parents heavily investing in and decorating college dorm rooms, a stark contrast to past generations' more spartan setups. Fuelled by social media, smart marketing, and intensive-parenting culture, families are projected to spend billions on dorm furnishings. While seemingly harmless, this parental over-involvement can hinder young adults' opportunities for self-expression and the development of autonomy, crucial for psychological independence. Experts warn that doing too much for students can inadvertently undermine their confidence and ability to navigate new challenges. The dorm room, ideally a blank canvas for self-discovery, becomes a space where students might miss out on essential life lessons and compromise skills.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, where he lauded his "great relationship" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Lee praised Trump's efforts and sought his help in establishing lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, even suggesting a Trump Tower in North Korea and a golf game between Trump and Kim. Earlier, Trump had criticized South Korea on social media, alleging a "purge" and "vicious raids on churches" by its new government, but adopted a softer tone during the meeting. The leaders also discussed their recent trade deal, with Trump affirming its finality despite South Korean interest in renegotiation.</p>
