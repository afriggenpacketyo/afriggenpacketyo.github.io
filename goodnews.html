        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite government initiatives to revive American manufacturing, companies are struggling to fill nearly half a million open jobs. Factors contributing to this shortfall include a tight labor market, a need for specific skills (including college degrees for many positions), and an aging workforce expecting retirements. The Biden administration's $2 trillion investment aims to construct new factories, further increasing demand for manufacturing workers. Solutions involve higher pay, better apprenticeship programs, and improved public perception of manufacturing jobs.</p>
