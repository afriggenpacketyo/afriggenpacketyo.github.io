          <p>New York Giants offensive lineman James Hudson III had a difficult start to the game against the Dallas Cowboys, accumulating four penalties for 30 yards on the team's opening drive alone. His miscues proved costly, potentially taking points off the board for the offense. One notable penalty for unnecessary roughness occurred when Hudson took an open-handed swing at Cowboys pass-rusher James Houston. Another penalty on Hudson nullified a 35-yard pass, forcing the Giants to settle for a field goal instead of a potential touchdown opportunity in the crucial divisional matchup.</p>

          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, anticipates a "short" selection meeting for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, indicating the team is largely settled. The main point of discussion is expected to be the selection of a second spinner to support the first-choice, Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that the squad will likely consist of 17 players, including up to seven specialist seam bowlers, and will not feature a specialist backup wicketkeeper. He expressed confidence in the team's preparation and readiness for the highly anticipated series, which is set to begin in November.</p>

Running a personal best of 9.77 seconds, the 24-year-old became the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m title since Usain Bolt, who was in the crowd celebrating. Seville's victory represents a significant comeback after narrowly missing a medal in the previous world championship and finishing last in the 2024 Olympic final. His compatriot Kishane Thompson took silver, securing a dominant one-two finish for Jamaica.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his nearly $80 million in career earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Following a strategy to live off endorsement deals while investing his NFL salary, Barkley's investments are said to include AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This approach was partly motivated by a significant injury in 2020, which highlighted the finite nature of his athletic career. Barkley aims to use his earnings to create generational wealth for his family.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, emphasizing a message of party unity. In a speech in Sunderland, she urged members to support her to prevent internal divisions that could benefit political rivals like Reform UK. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. The contest, which also features former Commons leader Lucy Powell, is seen by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has demonstrated a remarkable pattern of scoring decisive late goals to secure victories in the Premier League this season, drawing comparisons to the famous "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past. The team has won all four of its opening matches with winning goals scored in the final minutes, including a 100th-minute winner against Newcastle. This trend has established a psychological advantage, creating an aura of inevitability that they will find a way to win, even when not playing at their best. This resilience and winning mentality signal a formidable challenge for any team hoping to contest their title.</p>

          <p>This poem by Ashley M. Jones, from her new book "Lullaby for the Grieving," reflects on the enduring power of language, faith, and song for African Americans throughout history. It traces a journey from the holds of slave ships, through oppression where reading and writing were forbidden, to the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham. The poem frames historical figures and everyday people as messengers carrying a divine word, using their hands, voices, and spirits to create and persevere. It concludes with a powerful affirmation of collective resilience, describing the community as a "living tongue" and an "unstoppable song."</p>

          <p>Wall Street is closely watching the Federal Reserve this week, with markets widely anticipating a 25-basis-point interest rate cut at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday.
