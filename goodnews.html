          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack on a Lady Gaga concert held on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro.

The alleged mastermind was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager was detained for storing child pornography. The concert, aimed at revitalizing Rio's economy, drew a crowd of over two million people and was secured by 5,000 officers, drones, and facial recognition cameras.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's rocket facility in South Texas, Starbase, is on track to become an official city following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The initiative has drawn support due to the jobs and investment SpaceX brings to the area, but also criticism over concerns about Musk's increased control, including potential beach closures for launches. SpaceX says the city status is needed to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for residents, while critics worry about public access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.</p>
