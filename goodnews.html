The mission will deliver essential supplies to the astronauts currently in orbit. Notably, the cargo includes two sets of advanced, domestically developed spacesuits with an extended lifespan for more spacewalks. Additionally, the delivery will feature specialized core muscle training equipment designed to help astronauts counteract the effects of muscle atrophy in microgravity.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that while college students widely believe finance offers the best career prospects, federal data suggests this perception may be inaccurate. In reality, majors such as art history and philosophy currently have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates than finance or computer science. This counterintuitive trend is partly fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, which has increased employer demand for the creative thinking and soft skills typically developed through a humanities education.
