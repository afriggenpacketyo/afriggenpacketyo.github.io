          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist, has passed away at the age of 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy that profoundly impacted our understanding of the natural world. Her pioneering research in Tanzania, which began in 1960, revolutionized scientific understanding of chimpanzees, demonstrating their tool-use and complex social behaviors previously thought unique to humans. Beyond her groundbreaking scientific contributions, Goodall became a tireless global advocate for animal welfare and environmental protection, inspiring countless individuals and organizations to join the fight against habitat devastation and climate change. Her work significantly shaped evolutionary science and ignited a global movement to safeguard the natural world, with her Jane Goodall Institute continuing to champion these critical causes for future generations.</p>

          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting to unprecedented surges in gold prices, particularly affecting demand for traditional wedding jewellery. Global gold prices have soared by over 48% this year, hitting a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, building on a substantial 26% gain from the previous year. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook observe that despite these dramatic increases, consumers have gradually adjusted to the elevated costs, prioritizing cultural traditions such as buying gold dragon and phoenix bracelets for weddings. This article highlights how market dynamics and deeply ingrained cultural practices interact, influencing consumer spending in a high-value sector.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a parking dispute last month, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. Cruz had been held in police custody for five hours after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his car. His agent maintained that Cruz had merely asked the women to move their vehicle to prevent them from getting wet and that any water splash was unintentional, occurring as they began to record him. The decision by prosecutors marks the resolution of this minor but publicly reported incident involving the actor.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmaking giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix experienced significant surges, with SK Hynix hitting a 25-year high, following their announced partnership with OpenAI. This collaboration is part of OpenAI's "Stargate" initiative, aimed at increasing the supply of advanced memory chips essential for next-generation AI and expanding data center capacity in South Korea. The agreement, forged during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's visit to Seoul, underscores the critical role these firms play in the burgeoning AI value chain. With SK Hynix already a major supplier to Nvidia and Samsung working to certify its chips, this strategic alliance positions both companies at the forefront of AI memory technology.

          <p>Maxwell House coffee has launched a viral marketing campaign, humorously rebranding itself as “Maxwell Apartment Coffee” to acknowledge the escalating unaffordability of housing in the U.S. The 133-year-old brand’s campaign playfully addresses the economic reality where fewer Americans can afford to purchase homes, with the median age of first-time homebuyers now at an all-time high of 38. By offering "the same affordable coffee you love, now with an even more affordable name," the company aims to forge a connection with the growing demographic of coffee-loving renters across the country. This article highlights a clever corporate strategy that leverages social commentary to strengthen brand relevance amidst pressing economic challenges.</p>

The unprecedented increase in wealth further solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest individual, well ahead of other tech magnates.

          <p>Six individuals were arrested on Sunday after attempting to hang a banner on the iconic Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, according to local authorities. The group allegedly trespassed in the landmark's vicinity around noon, aiming to affix a banner, which appeared to feature a green-and-white pill capsule, to one of the prominent "O's." Police detained the individuals without incident, and the investigation has since been transferred to L.A. city park rangers. The specific message or purpose behind the banner attempt remains unclear, but the incident highlights ongoing challenges in protecting the famous landmark from unauthorized access and potential vandalism.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in funding designated to protect New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan stated that the state of New York would "quite likely" be able to prove that the Trump administration improperly cut these funds as a punitive measure for the state's non-cooperation with its large-scale deportation program. The ruling underscores that such grant programs were created to allocate funds based solely on terrorism risk, referencing New York's extensive history of terror attacks since 9/11. This article reports a significant legal challenge and temporary victory against the administration's perceived politicization of critical security funding.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted an inventive, silent protest during a press conference after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting position. Sanders, a former college star playing for his father Deion Sanders, responded to reporters' questions by moving his mouth and gesturing but emitting no actual words, effectively "muting" himself. This unusual and brilliant response is believed to be a reaction to critical remarks made by former NFL coach and current analyst Rex Ryan, who had taken issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities as a backup quarterback.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to closely examine the market's third-quarter winners, suggesting that while many of these top performers could continue to rally through the end of the year, the "biggest gains may, indeed, have already been made." He explained that fund managers often acquire these successful stocks in the fourth quarter to demonstrate strong portfolio performance to clients. Cramer highlighted several key Q3 successes, including AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Teradyne, Intel, and Invesco, attributing their substantial gains to factors such as surging AI demand, significant balance sheet improvements, and strategic corporate partnerships.

          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering guidance on healthier choices for frying and general use. Professor Nita Forouhi of Cambridge University clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils, despite bad press, are beneficial due to low saturated fats and high mono/polyunsaturated fats, making them "absolutely good for us." She also notes that modern margarines are healthy, containing near-zero trans fats. Forouhi advises that while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil or vegetable/sunflower oil is suitable for shallow or deep frying, respectively. The article provides practical, evidence-based advice for consumers.</p>
