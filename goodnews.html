          <p>Enterprise technology firm ServiceNow reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, which caused its shares to climb. The company's subscription revenues saw significant growth, hitting $3.11 billion, prompting an upward revision of its full-year guidance. CEO Bill McDermott credited the robust performance to widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, stating that AI is refactoring business processes across all industries. Despite some uncertainty in its federal business sector, the company remains confident in its outlook for the upcoming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler stated that maintaining the Republican House majority, to which his competitive district is critical, was a key factor in his decision. The announcement clears the field for other potential GOP challengers to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul, most notably Representative Elise Stefanik. The decision was followed by a sharp exchange of words between Lawler and Hochul, highlighting the contentious political climate in the state ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Two federal judges have issued critical rulings in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. A Tennessee judge ordered his release from criminal custody pending trial, while a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining or deporting him upon release, requiring 72 hours' notice for any removal proceedings. This legal intervention follows Abrego Garcia's previous deportation to El Salvador, which the government acknowledged as an "administrative error." His lawyers praised the rulings as a necessary protection of his due process rights against what they term the government's "lawless conduct."</p>

          <p>Elite cyclists competing in the grueling Tour de France are powered by a revolutionary approach to carbohydrate consumption, allowing them to ingest and metabolize thousands of calories each day. Exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar explains that recent advancements in sports nutrition enable athletes to sustain extreme levels of physical exertion over the multi-week race. This focus on high-carbohydrate intake is crucial for performance and recovery during one of the world's most demanding endurance events. The strategy represents a significant shift in how athletes fuel themselves for peak performance in professional cycling.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was closely fought, with India finishing on 264-4 after being put in to bat. The tourists' efforts were hampered by an injury to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, who retired hurt on 37 after being struck on the foot. England's captain Ben Stokes was a key performer, taking two crucial wickets, while recalled spinner Liam Dawson also made an impact. India's Sai Sudharsan scored a valuable 61, but his dismissal late in the day left the match evenly poised heading into day two, with England set to take the second new ball.</p>

          <p>According to former captain Michael Vaughan, veteran spinner Liam Dawson makes England a stronger and more balanced side. Playing in his first Test match in eight years, Dawson made an immediate impact by dismissing a key Indian batsman and providing crucial control with his bowling on the first day of the fourth Test. Despite being consistently overlooked for years, Dawson's all-around package, including his reliable bowling, solid fielding, and strong batting record in domestic cricket, is seen as a valuable asset. Dawson himself expressed that he didn't expect to play for England again and is focused on enjoying the opportunity.</p>

In contrast, the consumer products segment declined by 16%, pressured by tariff impacts and shifting retailer orders.
