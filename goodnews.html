          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City mayoral primary was significantly propelled by the organized, grassroots movement supporting Palestinian rights. The author contends that years of activism shifted public discourse, making Mamdani's vocal pro-Palestinian stance an asset rather than a liability within the Democratic party. The campaign's success is attributed to a coalition of activists and voters who were already mobilized on progressive issues and saw him as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks their concerns.</p>
