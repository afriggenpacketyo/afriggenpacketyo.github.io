        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters have expressed support, viewing the action as aligned with his 'America First' agenda and trusting his judgment to protect American interests while avoiding prolonged conflict. While some voters voiced disappointment, fearing escalation, others see the strikes as preventative and necessary to disarm countries posing future threats. Supporters also defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval, citing the need for swift action to protect American safety. Some Republicans, however, criticize the strikes, accusing Trump of betraying his pledge to avoid 'never-ending wars'.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin in approximately six hours, involving two 12-hour periods. Neither Israeli nor Iranian officials have publicly commented on Trump's announcement, but the agreement is described as a cessation of hostilities following a 12-day period of conflict, which began with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear targets. The announcement comes after Iran fired missiles targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted with U.S. assistance. Trump has struck a de-escalatory tone, congratulating both countries on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices, which require patients to seek permission before receiving medical treatment. The agreement aims to standardize approvals, expedite decisions, reduce procedures subject to prior authorization, and honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers. While officials hailed it as a positive step, concerns remain about insurers' commitment, as similar pledges in the past have not been fully honored. Some states have already legislated prior authorization reforms, mandating faster decisions and greater transparency from insurers.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE custody, spoke about his detention and rejected the Trump administration's claim that he is a threat to U.S. national security. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over three months, preventing him from being present for the birth of his son, which he described as a cruel act. Despite facing potential future detention, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian human rights and condemned antisemitism and racism within the Palestinian movement. His release came after a judge ruled that the government failed to prove that Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he was a flight risk.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning $21 million domestically, signaling challenges for original animated movies. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, possibly due to competition from other family-friendly movies and unfamiliarity with the title. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over time, similar to 'Elemental,' and emphasizes the importance of continuing to create original animated content. While animated sequels and films based on existing intellectual property have consistently performed well, industry insiders recognize the need for fresh stories to maintain the animation business's vitality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own economic interests. The analyst pointed to China's past agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. While about 16% of China's seaborne crude comes from Iran, its actions will be driven by economic self-interest rather than direct military intervention.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to increase its national security spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, meeting a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. The strategy aims to navigate an era of radical uncertainty and strengthen the UK's position in science, education, trade, and technology. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then, and seeks to stress that investment in defence will be felt "directly in the pockets of working people" pointing to new jobs that would be created.</p>
