        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Magic Eden, an NFT marketplace, has partnered with the $TRUMP meme token team to launch an official $TRUMP-branded cryptocurrency wallet, featuring President Donald Trump's name and likeness, supporting the trading of $TRUMP and other digital assets, including Bitcoin. A waitlist for the wallet opened on Tuesday, with a broader launch planned for later this summer, but Eric Trump claimed to have no knowledge of the project. Magic Eden pointed to the TrumpMeme X account's repost of the wallet announcement when asked for clarification on Eric Trump's denial. The project is promoted as "the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans," promising a share in $1 million in $TRUMP rewards for users who sign up and refer friends.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses faced a week of mixed fortunes as they prepare for Euro 2025, with manager Wiegman dealing with Mary Earps' retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal. Despite these challenges, England produced a strong performance against Portugal, showcasing attacking depth, though they later lost to Spain in the Nations League. Former players emphasize the importance of getting key players fit and prepared for the Euros, and Wiegman considers the Spain loss a valuable learning opportunity. The England boss expressed satisfaction with the week overall, highlighting players returning from injuries and competing for positions.</p>

          <p>The UK has been exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order that doubled steel and aluminium tariffs from 25% to 50% for other countries. While the increased import taxes apply to US firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK and US tariff pact signed in May will eventually eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminium, but it has not yet taken effect. A UK government spokesperson stated their commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US judge ruled that the US Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care for transgender inmates, despite an executive order signed by Donald Trump to halt funding for such care. The judge allowed a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action, ordering the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations while the lawsuit plays out. A White House spokesperson said the Trump administration expects to prevail in the legal dispute, while the ACLU hailed the ruling as a critical reminder that trans people have constitutional rights. The judge stated that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment.</p>

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the company behind Oreo, has filed a lawsuit in the US against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks.

The lawsuit includes side-by-side pictures comparing Mondelƒìz' products with Aldi's versions, including Wheat Thins, Nutter Butter, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. While Aldi US has not responded to the BBC's request for comment, Mondelƒìz claims that Aldi has continued making "unacceptable copies" despite being contacted about the issue.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, marking a significant milestone for the bank. The Fed cited the bank's progress in addressing deficiencies as the reason for removing the growth restriction, allowing Wells Fargo to expand its business lines. This removal is expected to enable Wells Fargo to increase deposits, expand lending, and grow its dealmaking division. Wells Fargo shares rose in after-hours trading following the announcement, as investors anticipate new growth opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
