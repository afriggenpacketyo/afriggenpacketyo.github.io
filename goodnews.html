          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more difficult due to rising interest rates and stricter lender underwriting standards. Experts advise that if an application is denied, borrowers should first ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios or low credit scores. Proactive steps to improve approval odds include checking credit reports for errors, reducing existing debt, and ensuring a strong overall financial profile. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans can serve similar purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials rendered the convictions unsafe. Hayes, who spent over five years in jail, described the ordeal as having "destroyed" his family. This ruling vindicates the traders' long-held argument that they were scapegoated to appease public anger over the financial crisis and could open the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division, including popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! This success helped to balance the continued weakness in its traditional toy business, which has been negatively affected by tariffs. The company reported a significant net loss of $855.8 million, which it attributed to a $1 billion goodwill impairment and tariff impacts. Despite the challenges, Hasbro raised its full-year guidance, anticipating revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wide receiver George Pickens, now with the Dallas Cowboys after being traded from the Pittsburgh Steelers, is looking forward to a "fresh start" with his new team. During training camp, he expressed enthusiasm about the new offensive system, stating he was "definitely excited to run better plays," a subtle critique of his former team. Pickens also spoke optimistically about his potential partnership with fellow receiver CeeDee Lamb, comparing their combined styles to the "Mario Bros." His addition is expected to enhance the Cowboys' offense and provide another significant target for the quarterback.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence tool named Aeneas that can analyze and interpret incomplete ancient Roman inscriptions. The system is capable of filling in missing text, determining the date of an inscription, and identifying its geographical origin with remarkable accuracy. While AI has been used before to read damaged scrolls, Aeneas automates the painstaking process of cross-referencing tens of thousands of texts for parallels. Historians working with the AI assistant have found it accelerates their work and reveals connections they had not previously considered, potentially transforming the study of ancient history.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Ben Schneider, the frontman of the band Lord Huron, delved into the themes of his band's new album, "The Cosmic Selector: Vol. 1." Schneider explained that his music often poses more questions than it answers, exploring mysteries of the cosmos, consciousness, and love. He discussed his creative process, which involves writing from the perspective of various characters and embracing strangeness, referring to influential people in his life as "crucial weirdos." Despite the band's success, including a multiplatinum single, Schneider maintains a humble perspective on fame and focuses on the artistic pursuit of exploring life's unanswered questions.</p>

The pilot program is set to launch next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit. While the preference is not a guarantee, the company states it will increase the likelihood of a woman-to-woman match. This initiative follows similar features tested in other countries and comes as ride-hailing companies like Uber continue to address long-standing safety concerns, including incidents of sexual assault and harassment.</p>

The banks believe this initiative will transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by enabling faster, 24/7 transactions and creating a more efficient financial ecosystem for trading and collateral management.

The ruling, prompted by a request from Pacific Island nations threatened by rising sea levels, clarifies that states must cooperate to prevent climate harm and pursue the highest possible ambition in their national climate targets.

The upcoming closure has reignited curiosity, drawing lines of tourists and locals for a final look at the historical figure.

The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and grows to only four inches, was found under a rock in a small forest. Its rediscovery is considered significant for local conservation efforts, as many of the island's endemic species have already gone extinct. The blind, burrowing snake was first identified as a distinct species in 2008 and is now hoped to become a symbol for protecting the island's remaining unique wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>As many households struggle with rising debt from high inflation and interest rates, financial experts are highlighting several effective debt relief strategies. Methods like the debt avalanche, which prioritizes paying off high-interest debt first, can save significant money over time. For those with multiple debts, consolidation through a personal loan or a balance transfer credit card can simplify payments and lower interest costs. Other options include working with a nonprofit credit counselor on a debt management plan or, in more severe cases, pursuing debt settlement or bankruptcy, though these carry greater risks to one's credit.
