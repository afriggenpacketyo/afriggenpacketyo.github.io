          <p>Following the conclusion of the Glastonbury Festival, which was headlined by Olivia Rodrigo, thousands of attendees have begun their journey home, causing significant traffic delays. A major clean-up operation is now underway at the Worthy Farm site, with volunteers clearing discarded items and rubbish ahead of a planned fallow year in 2026. Organizers urged festival-goers to take all their belongings, though many items like tents and camping chairs were left behind. The festival, which faced an amber heat health alert, is set to return in 2027, with organizers planning improvements during the break.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response compared to an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a significant step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot later this year. The company's head of R&D stated that the combo shot aims to simplify vaccination, reduce healthcare system burdens, and improve patient uptake. This development positions Moderna as a potential frontrunner in the race to market a combination respiratory vaccine.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research into dog cognition reveals that a dog's primary sense is smell, fundamentally shaping how they perceive the world in ways humans often overlook. Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that create a rich, transient map of their environment. This olfactory-centric existence also influences their perception of time, as the fading intensity of a person's scent can signify how long they have been gone. Understanding this difference is key to appreciating the unique way dogs experience life, co-existing with humans despite a profound perceptual divide.</p>

Its strategy of maintaining a consistent menu and operating its own restaurants rather than franchising has led to high efficiency and an average unit volume of $6.6 million.

In contrast, many Russian initiatives, such as revitalizing a major sugar mill and a steel plant, have stalled.

While Neuralink has garnered significant public attention, competitors like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron are also making strides, some with less invasive technology that may face an easier path to FDA approval.

A Chinese government-backed foundation has announced a project to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, including creating new animated versions, to reintroduce them to younger global audiences. This no-holds-barred approach contrasts sharply with the U.S., where unions like the DGA and SAG-AFTRA have fought for protections against AI altering creative works or replacing labor. The divergence highlights a key difference in the global competition over AI, with China prioritizing technological advancement in media over labor and IP concerns.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new, restrictive outdoor smoking ban that prohibits lighting up in public parks, at beaches, near swimming pools, and in any public space where children may be present. The law, which aims to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, also forbids smoking within 30 feet of schools, libraries, and bus stops, with violators facing significant fines. While the measure has public support, some critics argue it is excessive for outdoor spaces and is weakened by its exemption of e-cigarettes. The ban is the country's most significant anti-smoking effort since indoor smoking was prohibited in bars and restaurants in 2008.</p>
