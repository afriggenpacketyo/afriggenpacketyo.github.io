          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been dive-bombing residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home by a local falconer. The hawk, responsible for attacks on approximately 50 people, including one hospitalization, was captured last month and has since been trained by Wayne Housden. Housden built an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature him at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August, with hopes of eventually allowing him to fly freely. The hawk's behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial issues, and Housden believes the bird was a captive-bred escapee. The local community is relieved that the hawk is no longer a threat.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani expressed deep sorrow over the death of Bernard "Bernie" Kerik, describing him as his "best friend" and a "true patriot." Kerik, who served as NYPD Commissioner, passed away at 69 after battling an illness. Giuliani highlighted Kerik's leadership during and after the September 11th attacks, noting that Kerik was by his side within 20 minutes of the attack and "never left." Kerik's career was marked by achievements in law enforcement and controversies, including a prison sentence for federal felonies, which were later pardoned by President Trump. The two worked together again to investigate claims of election fraud following the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases. Saltmarshes, often lost to agriculture, are now recognized as essential "sinks" for carbon dioxide. WWF is advocating for their inclusion in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals to incentivize protection and restoration. The report, co-published with an insurance company, also underscores the role of saltmarshes in protecting homes from coastal flooding. The UK has lost approximately 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, emphasizing the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun debating legislation that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames, marking the first such deliberations in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of the opposition-sponsored bills is unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. Revisions to the Civil Code are necessary to enable couples to retain their individual family names after marriage, a practice predominantly affecting women who currently abandon their maiden names. A recent Kyodo News poll indicated that 71 percent of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. These deals often involve a "newco" structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising via a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates. This trend reflects a broader strategy for Chinese biotech firms to license their intellectual property as an alternative to raising funds through share sales. The number and value of these deals have surpassed figures from the same period last year.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The original complaint alleged Binance illegally served U.S. users, inflated trading volumes, and commingled customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach, coinciding with efforts from the Trump administration to foster a more industry-friendly environment. Binance is also taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the World Liberty team. (not investment advice)</p>
