          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Friday as investors awaited a crucial U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Mining stocks led the Stoxx 600 index higher. In corporate news, Danish wind farm developer Orsted saw its shares climb after shareholders approved a significant rights issue, a move made amid ongoing disputes with the Trump administration over offshore wind projects. The market sentiment improved following earlier fears about government debt, with a high probability placed on a Fed rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

This "superbrain architecture" is designed to enhance automated driving and infotainment capabilities, addressing a key area where legacy automakers have trailed behind EV leaders.

          <p>The London City Lionesses have broken the world transfer record in women's football by signing French international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for £1.4 million. This landmark deal surpasses the previous record set just last month and marks the third time the record has been broken this summer. The acquisition is a major statement of intent from the Women's Super League newcomers, who are funded by American owner Michele Kang and have made numerous high-profile signings. Geyoro, a 28-year-old midfielder with over 100 caps for France, joins a rapidly strengthening squad aiming to disrupt the league's established order.</p>

          <p>The world's largest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, is rapidly disintegrating as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey report that the iceberg, once the size of Oahu, is breaking into large chunks after a nearly 40-year journey. A23a calved from Antarctica in 1986 but was grounded on the seafloor for decades before finally breaking free in 2023. Researchers say its demise is part of a normal iceberg life cycle and not directly linked to climate change, providing a valuable opportunity to study its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced an ambitious plan to grow its sports industry to 7 trillion yuan (US$980 billion) by 2030, nearly doubling its current size. This initiative is part of a broader national strategy to expand domestic demand and shift towards a consumption-driven economic model. The directive, issued by the State Council, aims to cultivate internationally influential sports companies and events. As part of the plan, central authorities will increase coordination and support for regions applying to host major international sporting competitions, capitalizing on the growing public enthusiasm for spectator sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The boost was attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament, which spurred spending at clothing, footwear, and online retailers. The data release was delayed due to concerns about statistical quality, and the ONS acknowledged past errors in its calculations. Despite the monthly increase, the broader trend showed a 0.6% decline in sales over the three months to July, with economists warning the positive factors were temporary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A notable generational trend is emerging in U.S. politics, with a significant number of young Democrats under 40 running for Congress, often challenging established members of their own party. In contrast, young Republicans are largely remaining on the sidelines, with organizers pointing to satisfaction with their current leadership's effectiveness in fighting President Trump's agenda. This divergence reflects a broader discontent within the Democratic party, where younger members are calling for new leadership to address recent electoral setbacks. Meanwhile, young conservatives appear content to follow a more traditional path, waiting for senior figures to step down before seeking higher office.</p>

          <p>Germany's top women's football league, the Bundesliga, has expanded to 14 teams for the first time, kicking off its season with a record-breaking attendance of over 50,000 for its opening match. The expansion and increased broadcast coverage on free-to-air television reflect a surge in interest following recent international tournaments. However, questions remain about the league's overall competitiveness, which has been dominated by Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg for the last decade. While showing signs of growth, the Bundesliga still lags behind England's WSL and the US's NWSL in terms of revenue and competitive parity.</p>

          <p>Kenya is reportedly in advanced negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of China to restructure its debt by converting dollar-denominated loans into Chinese yuan. The move is intended to ease pressure on Kenya's foreign currency reserves and could significantly lower the interest rate on loans for major infrastructure projects like the Standard Gauge Railway. According to Kenya's Treasury, switching to yuan could halve the interest rate from over 6% to approximately 3%. This potential debt swap highlights a growing trend of African nations seeking alternative financial arrangements with China to manage their debt burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across the United Kingdom on Sunday evening, causing the full Moon to take on a deep red hue known as a "Blood Moon." The event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. While the eclipse will begin before the Moon rises in the UK, observers will be able to see the second half of the spectacle as the fully eclipsed Moon appears on the horizon around 7:30 PM BST. The reddish color is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon similar to what causes red sunsets.</p>
