          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring in his lungs. With less than a year to live and his lung function rapidly declining, he was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant. After a month in the hospital and a successful surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, Kennedy's lung capacity has been restored to 98%. He is now recovering, enjoying a second chance at life, and plans to train a new therapy dog named 'Encore' to celebrate his journey.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, Los Angeles Angels closer Kenley Jansen emerges as a potential trade candidate, with his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, being a logical fit. Jansen, who once thought he would spend his entire career with the Dodgers, is having a strong season and is a pending free agent on a non-contending Angels team. The Dodgers are in urgent need of right-handed relief pitching, and while Jansen is focused on winning, he has indicated he would be open to a non-closer role on a contending team. A trade could benefit both teams, providing the Dodgers with bullpen depth and the Angels with future assets.</p>

          <p>At a major conference in Shanghai, leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, urged for international collaboration between the U.S. and China to mitigate the existential risks posed by advanced artificial intelligence. Hinton acknowledged the political challenges but emphasized a crucial shared interest: preventing a scenario where AI systems become uncontrollable. He compared the current situation to the Cold War-era need for U.S.-Soviet cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation. The call for collaboration highlights a growing consensus among scientists that global coordination is essential to ensure that AI development remains beneficial for humanity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service played a crucial role in unifying the young nation. The celebration, however, occurs as the institution faces modern challenges, including recent discussions within the Trump administration about potentially privatizing the agency or folding it into the Commerce Department. The newly appointed Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated his opposition to privatization, affirming the agency's independent status.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Charging expenses to a rewards card and immediately paying the balance with savings can help couples earn points or miles for things like a honeymoon. However, experts warn against carrying wedding-related debt, as high interest rates can create financial stress at the start of a marriage. The key is to avoid sacrificing long-term financial well-being for a short-term event and to be aware of potential vendor fees for credit card payments.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal bill, the Captive Primate Safety Act, seeks to make the private ownership and breeding of primates illegal across all 50 states. Animal welfare experts argue that the pet trade fuels a brutal industry where poachers kill adult monkeys to capture their infants, who are then often smuggled and sold. These primates frequently suffer from severe stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage from being raised in unsuitable human environments. The bill, supported by a coalition of zoos and animal welfare groups, aims to slow this trade and protect primates from a life of suffering.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams defensive end Jared Verse recently endured a grueling workout with retired legend Aaron Donald, an experience he described as "psychotic" but deeply inspiring. After some playful social media banter, Verse joined Donald for a punishing circuit training session that left him completely exhausted. Donald emphasized the importance of maintaining strength late in games, a lesson Verse has taken to heart. The reigning NFL defensive rookie of the year said the workout showed him the level of dedication required to be an all-time great, and he is now striving to reach that standard in his own career.</p>

Piastri remained close behind but was unable to mount a successful overtake. The result gives Verstappen a winning start under new team principal Laurent Mekies and sets up an intriguing strategic dilemma for McLaren ahead of Sunday's main grand prix.</p>

          <p>Sam's Club in China, known for its curated selection of premium, imported goods, has faced backlash from its middle-class members after stocking a low-priced, domestically made chocolate pie. The product, commonly found in local convenience stores, is seen by many members as falling short of the quality and global sensibility they expect from the retailer. For loyal customers, the introduction of the pie has triggered concerns that the Walmart-owned brand may be lowering its standards for supplier quality, potentially eroding the trust it has built with its aspirational consumer base.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The high-stakes meeting aims to prevent a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU imports from taking effect on August 1. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could include a 15% baseline tariff, similar to the recent U.S.-Japan agreement. A deal would provide stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, though it would still represent a significant shift from previous trade norms. (not investment advice)</p>
