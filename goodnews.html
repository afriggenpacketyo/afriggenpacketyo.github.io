        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions caused by tariffs imposed by President Trump. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by the punitive levies. While Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick resolution, emphasizing that even a reduction in tariff rates would still leave import costs significantly higher than before. The Trump administration is seeking concessions from China, while China insists it engaged in talks at the request of the United States.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers. Published in Science Robotics, the breakthrough allows drones to rapidly adjust speed and direction, potentially outperforming humans in intense flight missions. The algorithm draws inspiration from nature, where aerial acrobatics are essential for species like sparrowhawks and bats to hunt or avoid obstacles. Gao Fei, an associate professor at Zhejiang University, emphasized that transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards' is key to redefining drone flight.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state finances. This statement comes as opposition parties rally behind a consumption tax cut ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. While Ishiba acknowledged the need to support those in need, he emphasized the importance of thorough discussions to explore alternative solutions. Regarding tariff negotiations with the United States, Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to seeking a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports.</p>

Trump praised the "friendly, but constructive" talks and expressed a desire for China to open up to American business. The negotiations aim to de-escalate the trade war sparked by Trump's tariff rollout, which has resulted in both countries imposing tariffs well above 100% on each other's goods. While neither side has released specific details, the talks are viewed as a positive step towards resolving disagreements.</p>

Gallego, who won his Senate race in a Republican-leaning state, emphasized the need to build alliances with people who may not agree on every issue.

Yunnan's involvement in regional agricultural cooperation dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. With China's growing demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could support the country's food security. The province's proximity to Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam makes it a key player in this strategy.</p>

          <h2>Unusual Atmospheric River Event Expected to Bring Heavy Rainfall to Southeast U.S.</h2>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is bracing for an unusual atmospheric river event that is expected to bring widespread rainfall and potential flooding. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain across Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with isolated areas possibly receiving up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically impact the Western U.S., this event is caused by a cutoff low, diverting the jet stream eastward. The precipitation could alleviate drought conditions in some areas but also poses a flood risk.</p>
