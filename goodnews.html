Saltwater creates maintenance issues, while in Cambodia's Cardamom Mountains, the environment constantly tries to reclaim the land. They also contend with living far from their families, but they have found strength in working together as a couple in remote locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for its structure, where existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself, a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. In Circle's offering, 60% of shares will come from investors, versus 57% in Facebook's case. This unusual move likely reflects venture capital firms' eagerness for liquidity after a prolonged period of meager returns, with Silicon Valley investors keen to distribute funds back to their own investors. Circle, profitable with substantial cash reserves, aims to raise additional capital through the IPO.</p>

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton's sensational performance, including 32 points, 15 assists, and 12 rebounds, propelled the Indiana Pacers to a 130-121 victory over the New York Knicks, giving them a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Haliburton's triple-double, achieved without a turnover, marked his second career postseason triple-double, bringing the Pacers within one win of their second NBA finals appearance. Pascal Siakam added 30 points, and Obi Toppin's late three-pointer sealed the game, as the Pacers capitalized on a strong offensive showing. The Knicks, led by Jalen Brunson's 31 points, couldn't overcome Indiana's aggressive play.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud. The Chrisleys, known for their series "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks and the Internal Revenue Service. Todd Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while Julie Chrisley received a seven-year sentence. Trump's decision aligns with his pattern of granting clemency to individuals he believes have been unfairly targeted by the justice system.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly found a way to mitigate critical vibration issues in Hyperloop technology, potentially salvaging the futuristic high-speed ground travel concept. A study from China's Journal of Railway Science and Engineering indicates that even minor track imperfections can cause severe turbulence in vacuum-tube maglev systems. However, the researchers claim to have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more comfortable. The findings could revitalize interest in Hyperloop technology and address challenges faced by projects like Elon Musk's Hyperloop.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's attacks on Harvard University have unexpectedly fostered a sense of unity on a campus previously divided over issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and free speech. The administration's decision to bar Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in funding has prompted many to set aside their differences. Students and faculty members have rallied in support of the university, viewing the administration's actions as an existential threat to academic freedom.

          <p>A judge has struck down an executive order by President Trump targeting the law firm WilmerHale, marking another legal defeat for the administration's efforts to crack down on elite law firms. Judge Richard J. Leon ruled that the order was unconstitutional, supporting the firm's decision to fight back against the administration's pressure. The order, aimed at firms associated with Trump's political opponents, was deemed a punitive measure that infringed on fundamental rights. The ruling underscores the importance of an independent judiciary and bar in upholding the American justice system.</p>
