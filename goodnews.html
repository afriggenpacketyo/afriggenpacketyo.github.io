          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Maj. Gen. David Zini to head Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, following a public clash with the previous director, Ronen Bar. The appointment faces legal challenges, as Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara questions the timing and process, citing potential conflicts of interest related to an ongoing investigation into Netanyahu's aides. Opposition leader Yair Lapid has called on General Zini to decline the appointment until the high court weighs in. Netanyahu cited a loss of confidence in Bar following the October 7 attacks. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from dismantling the Department of Education. The ruling prevents the administration from firing half of the DOE's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration.

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while simultaneously securing the future of a strategically important U.S. military base. The deal allows the U.K. to continue leasing Diego Garcia, the largest island, for at least 99 years, maintaining the military facility in British and American hands. The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands, involving questions over Britain's colonial legacy. The move has garnered mixed reactions, with some Chagossians supporting the deal and others criticizing it for not securing their right to return to their homeland. </p>
