          <p>President Trump is advancing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, signing an executive order to that effect. Experts, however, doubt the plan's feasibility, citing potential legal challenges from drugmakers and the need for congressional approval. The order directs federal agencies to combat "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" in foreign countries, and seeks to allow U.S. patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the "most favored nation" prices. Experts question whether other countries will voluntarily increase their prices or if drug companies will voluntarily lower theirs. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the evolving meaning of "the closet" in queer culture, sparked by Paul Reubens' posthumous revelation about concealing his homosexuality for career reasons. The article traces the historical context of the closet from a place of shame and secrecy to a more complex space of negotiation and strategic concealment. It reflects on the pressures faced by gay artists and entertainers to remain closeted and the social impact of coming out in different eras. The article ultimately considers the resurgence of interest in closeted narratives, as well as the risks of silence in a world where LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly under threat.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli American national, following pressure from President Trump, in a deal that largely circumvented the Israeli government. Alexander's release is seen as an attempt by Hamas to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. Unlike most other hostages, Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The release highlights the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between the two sides, as Hamas still holds hostages and wants negotiations to end the war, while Israel wants to continue fighting.</p>

          <p>Due to rising home prices and mortgage rates, renting is now considered a better alternative to buying, but rents are also surging. Zillow estimates that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental, up from $60,000 in 2020. In cities like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, renters need to earn $100,000 or more to live comfortably. Experts say the inadequate housing supply is a major factor, and Congress needs to take action to expand affordable housing programs.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks closed significantly higher after the U.S. and China announced an agreement to slash tariffs for 90 days, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 1,160 points. The U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China committed to reduce tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. Experts noted that the previous set of tariffs threatened a surge in prices and a possible U.S. recession. The agreement marks the latest rollback of far-reaching tariffs initiated by President Trump, and economists estimate the reduction in U.S. levies on China will bring average U.S. tariffs down from 24% to 14%.</p>

The governor has created a template for a local ordinance that municipalities can adopt to outlaw encampments and clear existing ones. The move coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds that local officials can use to implement the ban. While the model ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it outlaws homeless encampments on public property, making them a crime by definition.</p>

          <p>Ticketmaster has announced that it will begin displaying the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping, aligning with the Biden administration's ban on "junk fees." The company will also provide shoppers with their place in the online queue and real-time updates on ticket availability and price ranges. Ticketmaster says it plans to step up its fight against ticket bots, blocking an average of 200 million bot attempts every day. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently suing Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan, brokered by the US, has held for a second day, halting the most serious fighting between the two countries since 1971. Children returned to school, airports reopened across border areas, and families mourned their dead. The fighting began after India struck multiple targets in Pakistan, claiming it was in response to a militant attack in India-administered Kashmir. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out discussions on the water treaty with Pakistan, saying any talks would focus only on Kashmir and terrorism.</p>
