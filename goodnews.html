          <p>Four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone significant transformation, though not without challenges. The club has modernized its training facilities, won a major domestic trophy, and qualified for the Champions League, driven by manager Eddie Howe. However, growth has been tempered by Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing unlimited spending and forcing a more gradual build compared to previous takeovers like Manchester City's. The article also touches on the ongoing "sportswashing" criticism from human rights groups, who argue the investment is meant to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights record.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a new public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers to reshape its image and connect with younger audiences. The Chinese embassy in Kenya is funding trips for popular content creators to visit and showcase China's culture, scenery, and history, moving away from traditional state-led media campaigns. This "soft power" initiative aims to present a more accessible and positive view of the country, bypassing typical news coverage. Experts view this as a significant and potentially more effective evolution in China's efforts to strengthen its people-to-people ties across the continent.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, music icon Lionel Richie reveals that he was seriously considering becoming an Episcopal priest before his career in music began. As a shy young man, he was training for the clergy until a pivotal moment performing with his band, The Commodores. Richie recalls that a woman in the audience shouted "Sing it, baby!," which gave him the validation he needed to pursue music instead. He credits this fan's encouragement and his time with the band for helping him overcome his stage fright and discover his path as a singer and songwriter.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is launching a "Modernization Agenda" to integrate artificial intelligence across public services, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and enhance efficiency. The plans include using AI to expedite visa processing and create online platforms for businesses, reflecting a broader push to establish Germany as a leader in key technologies. However, some experts express concern that the government is rushing to adopt generative AI without sufficient scientific guidance or consideration for data privacy, highlighted by a recent deal between German software giant SAP and US-based OpenAI.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the protests in the city were not severe enough to justify federalizing the troops, stating the president's justification was "untethered to the facts." The decision, which blocks the deployment for at least 14 days, was celebrated by Oregon officials as a defense of state sovereignty and a rebuke of federal overreach. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>At a labor forum in San Diego, six Democratic candidates vying to be California's next governor identified housing affordability, cost of living, and healthcare as the state's most pressing issues. While largely in agreement on policy, candidates sought to differentiate themselves through their personal backgrounds and political experience. Former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized his extensive government service, while former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon highlighted his perspective as a millennial. The event provided a platform for the candidates to appeal to the influential AFSCME union ahead of the 2026 election.</p>
