          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, has stated the company's long-term strategy is to predominantly use its own custom-designed chips for its artificial intelligence data centers. This move aims to reduce reliance on external suppliers like Nvidia and AMD, which currently dominate the market for AI-powering semiconductors. By developing its own silicon, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator, Microsoft seeks to optimize the entire data center system, from processing power to cooling, for better price performance and efficiency. This reflects a broader trend among major tech companies to control their hardware supply chains.</p>

          <p>A two-day strike by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) at the Dangote refinery has been called off following government-mediated talks. The union had initiated the strike after accusing the company of firing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with foreign labor, a claim Dangote officials denied. According to Nigeria's Labor Ministry, an agreement was reached where the company will reassign the disengaged staff to other roles within the Dangote Group without loss of pay. The resolution averts a prolonged disruption at Africa's largest oil refinery.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that PPE Medpro, a company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband, must pay £122 million in damages for breaching a government contract during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care sued the company, arguing that millions of medical gowns supplied for the NHS did not meet contractual standards for sterility. The judge found that Medpro failed to prove the gowns had undergone a validated sterilization process. The ruling comes after Baroness Mone admitted she stood to benefit from the contract profits.</p>

          <p>Internet and telecommunication services are gradually returning to Afghanistan after a 48-hour nationwide shutdown ordered by the Taliban government. The blackout drew widespread international condemnation, as it disrupted businesses, emergency services, and further isolated the population, particularly women and girls who rely on the internet for education and contact with the outside world. While the Taliban has not provided an official reason for the shutdown, a provincial spokesperson previously mentioned blocking internet access "for the prevention of vices." The restoration of services is a relief for citizens and humanitarian organizations operating in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a net worth that places an individual in the top 1% by their 50s, which requires over $13 million, demands disciplined financial strategies starting from a young age. Financial experts advise that early and consistent investment in assets like real estate and stocks is crucial to leverage the power of compound interest over time. Another key principle is to live below one's means, even as income grows, to avoid "lifestyle inflation." By saving and investing a significant portion of income, such as 20-50%, individuals can build substantial wealth regardless of their starting salary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly payments on schedule during the government shutdown, as the program is funded through a permanent appropriation. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which could lead to disruptions in other services. With nearly 90% of its workforce deemed essential, the agency will continue processing payments, but activities like issuing replacement Medicare cards, benefit verifications, and processing overpayments will be halted. A prolonged shutdown could also potentially delay the release of inflation data needed to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, with strong performance in its electric vehicle and large SUV segments. Sales of all-electric models, like the Mustang Mach-E, surged by 30.2% to a new quarterly record, while sales of electrified vehicles including hybrids grew by 20%. The industry-wide increase in EV sales is partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of federal EV incentives at the end of September. The strong quarter for Ford indicates robust consumer demand for larger vehicles and a growing interest in the electric market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For seniors enrolling in Medicare, the six-month Medigap open enrollment period is a critical window that should not be missed, according to healthcare experts. This one-time period begins the month a person turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare Part B, and it guarantees them the right to buy any Medigap supplemental insurance plan sold in their state, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. Missing this window can result in being denied coverage or charged significantly higher premiums later on. Medigap policies are vital for many as they cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and coinsurance that Original Medicare does not.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a major initiative to reformulate its private-label food products, committing to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives, by 2027. The change will impact approximately 1,000 products across its store brands like Great Value and is a response to growing consumer demand for simpler and more familiar ingredients. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and increased federal scrutiny on the health effects of artificial food additives. The company stated that 90% of its private brand products are already free from synthetic dyes.</p>
