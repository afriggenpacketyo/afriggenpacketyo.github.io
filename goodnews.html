        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With one year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-host cities in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada face numerous logistical challenges, including transportation, security, and visa issues. The tournament, set to be the largest ever with 48 teams playing in 16 cities, anticipates over 6 million attendees and a $40 billion economic impact. Uncertainties surrounding visa processing, particularly for fans from countries facing travel restrictions, and recent civil unrest in Southern California pose potential threats to the event's success. While organizers express optimism, the FIFA's control over revenue and the financial burdens placed on host cities raise concerns about profitability for the host nations, especially given Chicago's withdrawal due to financial concerns. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>This Kyodo News digest summarizes several key events, including Japan's condemnation of Israel's attack on Iran, citing concerns about escalating tensions, and Japan's hope for special treatment in trade negotiations with the U.S. amid potential auto tariff hikes. Additionally, the digest covers China's response to Japan's defense activities in the Pacific, Japan's instruction for airlines to inspect Boeing 787s after an Air India crash, and the extension of Japan's SDF dispatch for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The digest also notes the election of a new Mongolian PM and New Zealand PM Luxon's upcoming visit to China. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, China is encouraging domestic sales by Chinese exporters through the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs). Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, guaranteeing payment to the seller and enhancing credit security, which is a major concern for Chinese firms. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, typically have a payment period of one year and can be used for both physical goods and services. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by facilitating a shift towards the domestic market. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Japan is seeking preferential treatment in ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States, as U.S. President Donald Trump hints at further increases in import levies on automobiles. Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, expressed hope that Japan would receive special consideration once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump's potential tariff hike on auto imports aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing, but it could negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to make progress in the talks before a possible meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's export restrictions. Experts suggest that India could emerge as a significant alternative to China for countries like the U.S., but this would require increased public and private investment in the sector. The recent shortage of rare earth elements has affected manufacturers across various countries, prompting Indian officials to explore ways to leverage India Rare Earths to boost production. India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has called China's export pause a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>An expert from the World Gold Council asserts that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, emphasizes that long-term demand for gold remains strong due to concerns over US dollar assets, geopolitical tensions, and the economic impact of tariffs. Reade argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He also notes that these digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold. The optimism score is 75.</p>
