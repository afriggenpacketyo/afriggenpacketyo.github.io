          <h2>European Automaker Stocks Rise on Hopes of Tariff Reductions Following U.S.-Japan Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>Shares in major European car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Porsche, experienced significant gains following a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan. The deal, which reduces U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has fueled investor optimism that the European Union might secure a similar tariff breakthrough. Analysts note that Japan's deal was achieved without export caps, a potentially positive sign for EU negotiations. However, some caution that Europe may need to match Japan's substantial investment commitments in the U.S. to achieve a comparable outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their UK convictions for manipulating key interest rates quashed by the court. The men were previously jailed for their roles in rigging the Libor and Euribor rates, which influence the cost of mortgages and commercial loans, during the financial crisis. They were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US for the scandal. While their convictions in the United States had already been overturned after they served their sentences, this latest ruling clears their names in the United Kingdom as well.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced that the island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs regime by the end of the year, transforming it into a major free-trade port. This initiative is a key component of Beijing's "dual circulation" strategy, aimed at stimulating domestic demand. The new system will allow approximately 6,600 types of goods to enter Hainan tariff-free, a significant expansion from the current policy. This move is expected to attract tourism and business while potentially acting as a strategic buffer amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a major trade agreement with Japan, the Trump administration is now focusing its attention on securing a similar deal with the European Union. With a looming August 1 deadline for 30% tariffs on EU imports, pressure is mounting on both sides to reach a resolution. The U.S.-Japan deal, which lowered auto tariffs to 15% without imposing export caps, has generated optimism among analysts that a favorable outcome for the EU is possible. Experts suggest the details of the Japan agreement could serve as a template for the upcoming negotiations with Brussels.</p>

          <p>George Finch, a 19-year-old from the Reform UK party, has become the youngest council leader in the United Kingdom, taking charge of the £2 billion budget of Warwickshire County Council. Finch, who still lives at home and cannot drive, has dismissed criticism about his lack of experience as "ageist." He abandoned plans to become a history teacher, citing what he calls "socialist wokeism" in universities, and was inspired by figures like Lee Anderson. As leader, he has already used his influence to engage with local education leaders on the importance of British culture and aims to attract more young people to his party.</p>

          <p>A new study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey provides strong evidence of a society centered around women. DNA analysis of remains buried under houses revealed that individuals were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This finding, published in the journal Science, confirms long-held archaeological suspicions based on female figurines found at the site. Researchers also found more grave goods with female bodies, further suggesting women held an elevated status, though it does not definitively prove the society was a matriarchy.</p>

          <p>The 2025-26 English Premiership rugby season, now rebranded as the 'Prem,' will kick off with a Thursday night fixture for the first time in its history. The opening match will see the Sale Sharks face Gloucester on September 25th at Salford Stadium. This scheduling change is part of an effort to give the league a more informal feel and attract younger fans. The opening weekend will avoid a Saturday match to prevent a clash with the Women's Rugby World Cup final. The season will consist of 18 rounds, culminating in the Prem final at Twickenham on June 21, 2026.</p>

          <p>Amidst years of frequent and high-profile protests in the United States, from the Women's March to racial justice uprisings, questions are emerging about their overall effectiveness in achieving lasting social change. An NPR segment discusses this topic with Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, author of "A Protest History of the United States," and Lex McMenamin, an editor at Teen Vogue. The conversation delves into historical examples of resistance to understand which forms of protest have succeeded in the past. It also examines what constitutes a "win" for modern protest movements and what lessons can be applied from historical struggles to contemporary activism.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at 0.8% in June, remaining at its lowest point in over four years and coming in below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, was also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft inflation figures are seen as providing the Monetary Authority of Singapore with the flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy. Such a move would aim to support the country's export-dependent economy, which faces uncertainty from a subdued global growth outlook and the potential impact of international trade tariffs.

Retail analysts suggest the business benefits from high-profit margins and the "treatonomics" trend, where consumers buy small, affordable luxuries.
