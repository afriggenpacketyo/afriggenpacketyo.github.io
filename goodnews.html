          <p>Interpol has reported the arrest of 20 individuals across 12 countries in Europe and the Americas following a coordinated operation targeting child sexual abuse material. The operation, initiated by Spanish police, focused on online messaging groups circulating child sexual exploitation images. Among those arrested were a health care worker accused of paying minors for explicit images and a teacher accused of possessing and sharing such material. This international effort underscores the ongoing commitment to combating child sexual abuse and holding perpetrators accountable for their crimes.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited significantly softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth as reasons for the move. While the decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, signaling a potential slowdown. The RBI has shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further rate cuts and will carefully assess incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>The government has announced a ban on bonuses for senior executives at six water companies that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards. The ban applies to firms that are not financially resilient or have been convicted of a criminal offense. This measure is a response to public outrage over sewage spills and rising bills, while water company executives have received substantial rewards. The regulator, Ofwat, can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action against companies violating the ban, which is backdated to April 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global markets are bracing for another potential 'China shock' as overcapacity in the country's manufacturing sector leads to a flood of cheap exports. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., excess production is rippling through global markets, raising concerns in Asia about local industries being squeezed. However, economists suggest that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures for inflation-worn economies, potentially offering central banks some relief. This situation presents both challenges and opportunities for economies worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, with plans to move it to a dry dock for repairs. The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during its launch, causing the stern to slide prematurely into the water. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the speed of the refloating process, which involved the use of aerostatic balloons.</p>

The judge cited that Harvard had demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit. Harvard had filed a legal challenge, calling it illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. This action is the latest attempt by the administration to prevent Harvard from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship.</p>
