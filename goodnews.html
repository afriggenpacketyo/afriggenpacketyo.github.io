          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's foreign policy is fostering closer cooperation with Japan, marked by his unprecedented choice of Japan for his first foreign visit since 1965. Analysts interpret this as a strategic alignment, particularly within the context of US-Japan-Korea collaboration, aimed at addressing the "China challenge." Zhan Debin of Shanghai University of International Business and Economics suggests Beijing should adopt a pragmatic view of Seoul's new government, given the focus on shared international challenges and interests. This diplomatic shift underscores evolving regional dynamics and the pursuit of unique insights into East Asian security.</p>

          <p>Anastasiia, a 17-year-old living in Kyiv, offers a poignant glimpse into life in Ukraine's capital, where the war is an ever-present reality but does not exclusively define existence. Despite daily air raid sirens and the visible scars of conflict, she finds normalcy in school, parks, and book cafes, cherishing her city's rich history and vibrant culture. Anastasiia's story highlights the resilience of young Ukrainians, as she plans to study applied chemistry and remains committed to staying in Kyiv to help rebuild her country, even as many peers consider moving abroad.

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign urging mobile users to wear headphones or use hands-free kits on public transport, aiming to curb the "disruptive behaviour" of playing music and making calls on loudspeakers. TfL research indicates that 70% of passengers find such noise a nuisance, with some experiencing it as stressful, particularly those with heightened sensitivity, such as individuals with autism. The campaign, which starts on the Elizabeth line and will expand to other services from autumn, seeks to foster a more considerate and stress-free environment for all commuters. This initiative comes as 4G and 5G mobile coverage continues to expand across large sections of the Tube network.</p>

Personal revelations include her knowing she loved Harry by their third date, when they were camping in Botswana, and his being the first to say "I love you." The series, which notably omits any mention of the Royal Family or on-camera appearances by Harry and the children, also reveals that she misses Magic Radio from the UK.</p>

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, signaling a strong determination to meet its climate targets. New guidelines from top policymakers also call for setting absolute limits on emissions, a tougher standard compared to the current system that caps based on carbon intensity. This expansion, which will initially include the steel, aluminum, and cement industries this year, is expected to significantly spur demand in the often-sluggish carbon market. Analysts believe this move could lead to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for China, the world's largest carbon polluter.</p>

          <h2>Ryder Cup Captain Keegan Bradley Faces Dilemma Over Playing Role</h2>

          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley faces a significant dilemma over whether to play in next month's tournament, a decision he describes as "the biggest of my life." While he is currently ranked 11th in the world and eighth among Americans, the extensive duties of captaincy typically preclude a playing role, with no Ryder Cup featuring a playing captain since 1963. Bradley's recent strong performance, including rounds of 64 and 63, complicates his choice. The article explores arguments for and against his participation, noting potential criticism for self-indulgence if he plays and the team loses, versus not contributing on the course if he sits out. Europe's team, by contrast, is in a much more settled state.</p>

          <p>Hugo Ortega, a former engineer, quit his well-paying job and relationship to backpack the world, eventually discovering a lucrative career in the yachting industry. With no prior boating experience, he transitioned from deckhand to superyacht captain, a role that can now earn him up to $20,000 a month including tips, with top captains making $30,000 monthly. Ortega, who also appeared on Bravo's "Below Deck," emphasizes that while the job requires a willingness to learn and a customer-service personality, it offers significant financial benefits and travel opportunities, allowing him to save most of his income. He now mentors aspiring "yachties" through his "Superyacht Sunday School" program, helping over 90% of students find jobs.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for Tuesday night, after two previous attempts were scrubbed due to an oxygen leak and an electrically charged cloud. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is crucial for accelerating launch cadence and testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, which are essential for NASA's planned moon landing by 2027 and eventual Mars missions. Elon Musk acknowledged thousands of engineering challenges remain, especially perfecting orbital refueling, while some NASA veterans express doubts about the 2027 moon landing timeline given the mission's complexity.</p>

These medications, initially for diabetes and obesity, are showing potential in treating various other conditions, sparking a new era of drug innovation. Goldman Sachs estimates GLP-1s could boost U.S. gross domestic product by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings, assuming 30 million users. Their widespread adoption is also shifting consumer spending patterns, particularly reducing grocery spending on processed foods, and potentially impacting industries from alcohol to travel, though concerns about socioeconomic divisions due to cost remain.

Zambada, 75, admitted the Sinaloa cartel, which he co-led with Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, trafficked at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine and bribed Mexican police and military commanders to operate freely. His arrest last year, at the end of the Biden administration, sparked deadly cartel infighting in Sinaloa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the plea as a "landmark victory," ensuring Zambada will spend the rest of his life in a federal prison.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue its path over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next couple of days, posing no threat to land. The storm began weakening Monday night, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, located about 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda. Forecasters predict Fernand will likely become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating on Wednesday. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 but also did not make landfall. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had forecast an above-normal hurricane season this year, predicting between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>
