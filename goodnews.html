          <h2>Cleveland Fed President Expresses Hesitation on Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 13:42:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack expressed significant hesitation about lowering interest rates, emphasizing that persistent inflation remains a critical threat. In a CNBC interview, she diverged from market enthusiasm, which was sparked by Chair Jerome Powell's earlier suggestion of potential policy easing. Hammack stressed the necessity of maintaining a "modestly restrictive" policy stance to guide inflation back to the Fed's target, which has been exceeded for four years. She indicated her belief that the "neutral" interest rate, which neither stimulates nor constrains economic activity, is higher than what many other Fed officials perceive. This cautious stance aims to prevent any resurgence of inflationary pressures, despite futures traders pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a September cut.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 13:31:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada announced it is dropping many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, a move signaling a significant improvement in trade relations between the two nations. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed that while Canada's 25% tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place for now, the broader removal of counter-tariffs on a long list of goods will take effect September 1. This decision follows a "productive and wide-ranging" phone call between Carney and President Donald Trump, with both leaders agreeing to reconvene soon. The White House welcomed the move as "long overdue," and the action is seen as a step towards resolving trade disputes ahead of a scheduled review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement later this year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 13:18:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are grappling with rising costs due to President Donald Trump's increased tariffs, but are employing creative strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some price adjustments have occurred, companies are largely absorbing impacts or pushing costs back to vendors, and diversifying sourcing to minimize the hit. Consumer spending has remained resilient overall, though lower-income shoppers are proving more sensitive to price changes. Retailers expect tariff-related cost increases to continue through the second half of the fiscal year, but the overall tone is measured, with many expressing optimism that strong brand loyalty and new revenue streams, such as advertising businesses and third-party marketplaces, will help mitigate the financial pressures.</p>

Altman posits that AI will create new industries, enhance learning capabilities, and enable young entrepreneurs to achieve work that previously required decades of experience or large teams. While acknowledging potential job cuts, some experts predict millions of new roles will emerge, democratizing access to skills. However, a recent MIT report indicates that 95% of attempts to implement generative AI in the workplace have failed to boost revenue in the short term, suggesting significant challenges in effectively integrating AI into existing workflows.</p>

          <p>Gold is experiencing unprecedented investor interest, particularly in gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as a hedge against market uncertainty and volatility. Tailwinds from tariffs and inflation have propelled the precious metal to record highs, with global gold ETFs seeing substantial inflows, on track for their second-strongest year on record. Experts note that despite these inflows, investors are still less hedged with gold relative to the equity market compared to a decade ago, suggesting significant room for further allocation into gold ETFs. This article highlights gold ETFs as an accessible way for investors to diversify portfolios and protect against continued concerns around inflation and market fluctuations (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Novelist Lauren Groff embarked on a unique pilgrimage to Kyoto, seeking a deeper connection with Lady Murasaki, the enigmatic author of "The Tale of Genji," often credited as the world's first novel. Despite navigating the challenges of "overtourism" in Japan's former imperial capital, Groff found profound spiritual experiences not just in historical sites, but in unexpected sensory moments, such as eating an egg sandwich or taking a hot bath. Her journey, which reflects animist-leaning themes present in her own fiction, ultimately revealed a deeper understanding of Murasaki's often-puzzling writing structure and the "shifting, inconstant phenomenon" of the self through experiential connection rather than purely intellectual pursuit. This article explores a writer's unique approach to historical and spiritual discovery.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a significant surge, nearing its record high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments hinting at potential interest rate cuts. Traders, caught off-guard by Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole, rapidly repositioned their portfolios, leading to substantial short liquidations in ETH, which further propelled its price. This renewed momentum, driven by a perceived alignment between the administration and the Fed on easing policy, also boosted shares of ether-focused companies. Despite a recent streak of outflows, ether exchange-traded funds saw a considerable influx of $287.6 million on Thursday, indicating renewed investor confidence and a potential shift in the crypto market's trajectory (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's definitively dovish speech at Jackson Hole has significantly increased market confidence in impending interest rate cuts, leading to a broad stock market rally. Powell indicated that while upside risks to inflation exist, the impact of the Trump administration's elevated tariffs is likely a one-time hit, and expressed growing concern over a precarious jobs market. Consequently, the odds of a September rate cut jumped to 91%, with an increased likelihood of a third cut this year.

          <p>Archaeologists have successfully recovered numerous 2,000-year-old statues, Roman coins, and other artifacts from a sunken city off Egypt's coast in Abu Qir Bay, near Alexandria. Egyptian authorities believe the site may be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a significant center during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire, which was submerged over time by a series of earthquakes and rising sea levels. The remarkable finds include limestone buildings that may have served as places of worship, residential spaces, and commercial structures, alongside reservoirs and rock-carved ponds. Notable statues of royal figures and sphinxes, including one with the cartouche of Ramses II, were also retrieved, revealing rich historical remains from a lost civilization.</p>

          <p>The 2025 summer box office exceeded last year's performance, projected to reach at least $3.75 billion, a 2% increase, thanks to successful films like Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" and "Superman." This marked a rebound despite the lingering effects of prior writers' and actors' strikes, which impacted production schedules. However, industry analysts and cinema CEOs, while expressing optimism about the long-term resurgence of the industry, are warning of a significant cooldown in ticket sales through August, September, and October. A major box office rebound is not expected until late November with highly anticipated releases such as Universal's "Wicked: For Good" and "Zootopia 2," followed by "Avatar: Fire and Ash" to cap off the year.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the critical role of green spaces in combating record heat waves, particularly in marginalized communities disproportionately affected by rising temperatures. Decades of discriminatory housing policies like redlining have left low-income and communities of color with fewer trees and green infrastructure, making them hotter and more vulnerable. Environmental justice advocates are actively working to address this inequality by promoting urban forestry and establishing community gardens, which not only lower temperatures and filter air but also foster community well-being and provide essential cooling points. Data-driven initiatives, such as redesigning bus stops with more shade, are also helping cities mitigate heat exposure for public transportation users, aiming for more inclusive climate planning.</p>
