          <p>Recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have turned into a testing ground for competing military technologies, notably Chinese hardware versus Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's military arsenal, bolstered by defense cooperation with China, features advanced air and missile systems, drones, and multirole fighters. This contrasts with India‚Äôs diversified mix of Russian, Western, and domestically adapted platforms. The significant price differential between Chinese and Western military systems may reshape global defense procurement, even if Chinese technology demonstrates slightly less capability at a much lower cost.</p>

A potential youth mobility scheme allowing young people to move abroad for up to two years is being considered, although it faces mixed responses from opposition parties. Announcements around trade and security are expected to include British access to an EU defense fund, potentially boosting UK defense companies. The negotiations aim to reduce red tape on food exports and imports, and speed up processing times at European airports for British travelers.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of 'aggressive' prostate cancer, this article explains the disease's prognosis, signs, symptoms and treatment options. Prostate cancer cases have been on the rise in recent years, increasing 3% annually since 2014, and Biden is one of the more than 300,000 men to be diagnosed this year. Common treatment options include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiopharmaceutical treatments. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years should have the option to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening to monitor for prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms and the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade illness, but is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, marking another chapter in the health challenges faced by the Biden family.</p>
