          <p>An opinion article argues that Beijing's decennial parades hold significant meaning beyond mere spectacle for Hong Kong and Macau, reflecting national destiny and institutional resilience. It suggests these events are a declaration of deep national cohesion among the Chinese people, helping individuals transcend personal anxieties and connect with the nation's path. The article emphasizes moving beyond a Western-centric view to understand the parade's importance within the unique historical and current realities of Hong Kong and Macau. This collective display is seen as a powerful symbol of unity in a complex and fragmented world.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly altered his position on the war in Ukraine, now asserting that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This statement, made on Truth Social after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions of territorial concessions. Trump cited Russia's economic troubles as a factor, calling it a "paper tiger." Zelensky hailed this as a "big shift" and a positive signal, indicating an improved understanding with the US president regarding security guarantees.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service successfully disrupted a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which investigators say posed a significant threat to New York City's telecom systems and the UN General Assembly meetings. The operation seized 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. Early analysis indicates the network was used for communication among foreign governments, organized crime, drug cartels, and human trafficking rings. No arrests have been made yet, but the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have been instrumental in shaping its economic trajectory over more than seven decades, transforming its limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory." This article provides a historical overview of these 14 plans since 1953, illustrating how they have guided macroeconomic policymaking despite the country moving away from a command economy. Beijing is now focused on becoming a global innovation hub, with the upcoming 15th plan expected to continue this strategic shift up the value chain. These foundational documents offer a comprehensive survey of China's complex economic history.</p>

          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu has publicly revealed her past struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew." The 76-year-old, now nearly 12 years sober, describes the liberation of sharing her secret and the journey to recovery that began in 2013 after confiding in her family. She recounts her ability to hide her drinking, even while performing on "Strictly Come Dancing," classifying herself as a "highly functioning alcoholic." Lulu attributes her issues partly to a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father and hopes her story can help others break similar patterns.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Tyrique George, who almost left Chelsea in the summer, has impressed by seizing a first-team opportunity, notably with a starring role in a Carabao Cup comeback victory. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George scored and assisted the winning goal against Lincoln City, demonstrating his value to the team. This performance provides a welcome option for manager Enzo Maresca, who faces a shortage of fit strikers. The article highlights George's dedication and unique development path, contrasting with Chelsea's usual academy graduate trajectory, as he aims for continued first-team success.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police believe they have identified the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," the state's oldest unidentified person case, nearly 80 years after her dismembered body parts were found in 1946. The remains of the petite white woman, aged 30-50, were discovered under a headstone in a cemetery, having gone missing from law enforcement custody decades ago. Advanced forensic testing is now underway to confirm the identity. The article notes the case's grisly nature and the hope that this discovery will finally restore the victim's name to history.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off after scoring the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match against Southampton, receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration. Manager Arne Slot criticized the act as "stupid," especially given Ekitike had already been booked. The sending-off means Ekitike will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game, which is far from ideal for the team. While Ekitike apologized on social media, the incident serves as a learning experience for the young player who has otherwise had an excellent start to his Liverpool career.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate excessively loud commercials on streaming services, with a bill awaiting the governor's signature. The legislation, inspired by a new parent's frustration over disruptive ads, would prohibit platforms like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volume, streaming services were exempt. The industry initially opposed the bill, citing control issues, but changed its stance after an amendment removed the right for private parties to sue, relying instead on regulatory enforcement.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is expected to be on alleviating the financial challenges faced by local governments. The article highlights recent examples of a clampdown on undeclared overseas income, with wealthy individuals forced to pay significant back taxes, signaling Beijing's intensified efforts to boost revenue. These measures are part of a broader strategy to secure cash for local authorities, which have historically relied on lax enforcement of tax laws. The upcoming plan is anticipated to outline high-level policy priorities for sustainable development and fiscal stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are employing a "punchy" and aggressive strategy, heavily focusing on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as a "call to action" for their activists and donors. This approach aims to distinguish themselves from Labour and the Conservatives, hoping the prospect of a Farage premiership will energize their base. The party is also using Farage to highlight perceived disparities in media coverage. Despite Reform UK clarifying its stance on gun laws, the Lib Dems continue to challenge past remarks, reflecting a determination not to be overshadowed in an increasingly competitive political landscape.</p>
