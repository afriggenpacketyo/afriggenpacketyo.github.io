          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade deal, narrowly avoiding a deadline that could have imposed much steeper tariffs. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% that had been previously threatened. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments into the United States. The announcement was made by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who both hailed it as a significant achievement.</p>

He acknowledged the decline in public confidence in higher education and emphasized OSU's efforts to ensure affordability and workforce development.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 14:11:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have secured their two-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle, Rashawn Slater, with a landmark contract extension. The deal is a four-year, $114-million agreement, making him the highest-paid offensive lineman in the history of the NFL, with a reported $92 million guaranteed. As a key protector for quarterback Justin Herbert, Slater played a crucial role last season in the team setting a franchise record for the fewest offensive turnovers. Coach Jim Harbaugh has praised Slater's efforts, including him in his exclusive "Elite Nine" club of top players on the team, signaling strong organizational support for the new contract.</p>

          <p>Denise Huskins, a California woman whose 2015 kidnapping and sexual assault was initially dismissed by Vallejo police as a hoax, is now collaborating with law enforcement agencies to improve their investigative techniques. Her story, featured in the Netflix docuseries "American Nightmare," has led to invitations to speak to officers about science-based interviewing and treating victims with respect. After being publicly shamed, Huskins and her now-husband Aaron Quinn were vindicated when the perpetrator was caught and linked to the crime. Huskins says the work is helping her regain hope and turn a traumatic experience into a positive force for change.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow for the safe distribution of humanitarian aid. The pause will last for 10 hours each day in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, creating secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address the escalating hunger crisis. The move follows months of restricted aid access and growing international criticism over the humanitarian catastrophe, including images of emaciated children. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach all civilians in need.</p>
