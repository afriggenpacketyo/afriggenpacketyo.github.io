In a single game against the Milwaukee Brewers, he pitched a two-hit, 10-strikeout gem over six scoreless innings, while simultaneously hitting three monstrous home runs, including one that cleared Dodger Stadium. This dual-threat prowess, unprecedented in baseball history for its combined pitching and hitting excellence, has been hailed as one of the greatest individual athletic achievements ever.

          <p>Under manager Ruben Amorim, Manchester United achieved a crucial 2-1 victory over rivals Liverpool at Anfield, marking their first win there in nine years and their first successive Premier League victories since Amorim took charge. This result offers a potential turning point after a challenging 11 months, with goals from Bryan Mbeumo and a late winner from Harry Maguire showcasing the team's resilience. Despite the euphoria among fans and the manager's acknowledgment of "some luck," both Amorim and the players caution against complacency. They emphasize the critical need to build on this performance to overcome past inconsistencies and sustain positive momentum in the league.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting hundreds of Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals across California and Hawaii has concluded, with union officials citing "new momentum" to return to the bargaining table. The United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) sought a 25% wage increase over four years and increased staffing levels to enhance patient safety. Kaiser, conversely, asserts its employees already earn 16% more than industry peers and had offered a 21.5% wage hike. The union highlighted new Joint Commission standards recognizing adequate staffing as a patient safety mandate, while Kaiser maintains wages are the primary point of contention.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate center-left politician, has won the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections, signaling a significant potential policy shift in the long-stalled UN talks on reunifying Cyprus. Erhurman defeated the hardline incumbent Ersin Tatar by advocating for a federal solution, a stance long supported by the United Nations, in contrast to Tatar's two-state policy. His victory, securing 62.8% of the vote, was promptly congratulated by both Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Cypriot leader Nikos Christodoulides, both of whom expressed commitment to resuming peace talks. This outcome offers renewed hope for diplomatic progress in resolving the island's nearly 50-year division.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in one of the layers of the windshield. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is actively investigating the incident, and the multilayer windshield has been sent to its laboratory for examination. The design of the windshield ensures continued function even if one layer is damaged, which contributed to the safe outcome. All 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely, and passengers were subsequently transferred to their final destination on another aircraft.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter ingeniously utilized her "Saturday Night Live" appearance to cleverly address critics of her provocative pop persona. In a QVC sketch, she played a designer whose neck pillow inadvertently resembled female genitalia, coyly projecting innocence while the hosts panicked. Her opening monologue and a "girlboss" seminar sketch further allowed her to dismiss accusations of subservience and question why her sexuality draws such intense scrutiny. Carpenter's performance served as a self-aware, humorous, and effective response to the ongoing discourse surrounding her evolution from a former Disney star to a "raunchy pop queen."</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved significant progress in reducing smoking prevalence, cutting rates by over 50% between 2000 and 2020 through robust policies on taxation, packaging, and advertising bans. However, despite this public health success, the absolute number of smokers has unfortunately risen due to substantial population growth. The region now confronts the emerging challenge of rapidly increasing e-cigarette use, particularly among adolescents. While some nations have banned vaping outright, others, like Malaysia, face political resistance to stricter regulation, and Indonesia remains an outlier with high smoking rates and strong industry influence hindering further progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume student loan forgiveness under two key income-driven repayment (IDR) plans: the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plans. This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, reopens a vital path to debt cancellation for over 2.5 million eligible borrowers. Previously, the administration had paused forgiveness for these plans, citing broad interpretations of court orders related to the SAVE plan. The new agreement also clarifies that federal taxes will not be owed on eligible forgiveness received in 2025, providing significant financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>
