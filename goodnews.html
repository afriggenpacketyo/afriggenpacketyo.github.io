          <p>President Trump stated that Iran gave the U.S. "early notice" before launching missile strikes on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, minimizing the impact of the attack. He described Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak," suggesting a de-escalation of tensions. Trump also announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, though neither country has confirmed it. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack was anticipated and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing for it over the weekend.</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive, Rusty Braziel, stated that he doubts Iran will close off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. Braziel argues that Iran has too much to lose by closing the strait, as it exports 1.7 million barrels a day through it. He also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped following the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Braziel warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters expressed support, viewing the actions as consistent with protecting American interests. While some high-profile supporters accused Trump of betraying the MAGA movement, most voters interviewed believed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. These voters trusted Trump's leadership and his access to national security intelligence, with many also rejecting the argument that the military action required Congressional approval. The voters' support for Trump's decision stems from a belief that he will prioritize American interests and prevent prolonged regional conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's high-risk strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities may yield positive results if Iran refrains from further retaliation. Following Iran's missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no American casualties or damage, Trump expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. The situation mirrors the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, where limited retaliation led to de-escalation. If the current ceasefire holds, Trump's gamble may lead to renewed negotiations with Iran.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices. The agreement aims to standardize the approval process, deliver decisions faster, reduce the number of procedures subject to prior authorization, and honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers. This voluntary measure follows a similar pledge made in 2018 that was not fully implemented. Skepticism remains about whether insurers will abide by the agreement, with some calling for regulations to ensure compliance.</p>

          <h2>Trump De-escalates After Iran's 'Very Weak' Retaliation, Urges Peace</h2>

          <p>President Trump responded to Iran's missile attack on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by calling it "very weak" and urging both Iran and Israel to pursue peace. Despite previously warning Iran against retaliation, Trump struck a de-escalatory tone in his social media posts. While reserving the right to respond, the U.S. has no active plans for further retaliation at this time. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the attack, which allowed for no lives to be lost.</p>
