        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that a societal decline in politeness, particularly in online interactions, is negatively affecting individual happiness and mental health. The author defines politeness as a key component of the 'agreeableness' personality trait and cites research showing that being courteous to others can increase one's own happiness and reduce anger. The essay suggests that individuals can counteract this trend by making courtesy a habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity, thereby improving their own well-being and exercising personal freedom.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable has developed headphones integrated with a brain-computer interface that uses EEG sensors to measure the wearer's focus levels in real time. The technology analyzes brainwave frequencies to determine if a user is attentive or distracted, and an accompanying app can suggest taking a break. Beyond productivity, the company aims to use this non-invasive technology for broader brain health applications, such as detecting early signs of depression or Alzheimer's disease, by collecting data from an everyday wearable device.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut its key interest rate to 4% from 4.25%, marking the lowest level in over two years and the fifth reduction since last August. The decision was contentious, requiring two votes among policymakers who are balancing concerns over persistent inflation against a struggling economy and a softening jobs market. While the cut will provide relief to some mortgage holders, it may lead to lower returns for savers, and the narrow vote suggests future rate reductions are uncertain.</p>

Financial aid administrators and advocates are hopeful that the earlier, longer testing window will allow the department to resolve technical issues, leading to a smoother application process for students and families seeking federal aid.</p>

          <p>Global semiconductor giants like TSMC, Samsung, and Nvidia are emphasizing their multi-billion dollar investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities in the wake of President Trump's proposal for a 100% tariff on imported chips. The proposed tariff includes an exemption for companies that are building or have committed to building plants in the United States. This policy detail has led to a rise in the stock prices of chipmakers with a significant and growing American operational footprint, as investors anticipate they will avoid the heavy duties.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has declared that the Trump administration's abrupt cancellation of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) was "unlawful." The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by humanities groups after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated their congressionally appropriated funds. The judge stated that the groups were likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unconstitutional, as the power to control federal spending belongs exclusively to Congress, not the President.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest star to our sun that resembles it. This potential gas giant is located in the star's habitable zone, meaning temperatures could be suitable for life to exist on any moons it might possess, drawing comparisons to the fictional moon Pandora from the movie "Avatar." While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, the discovery in our closest stellar neighbor is a significant and exciting development.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative overview of key financial tools for seniors, examining how annuities, reverse mortgages, and Social Security can be used to generate retirement income. It frames Social Security as a foundational income source, while annuities offer a guaranteed lifetime payment stream akin to a personal pension. Reverse mortgages are presented as an option for house-rich, cash-poor seniors to access home equity without selling. The piece concludes that a blended approach is often the most effective strategy.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, achieved an average weight loss of nearly 12% in a late-stage trial. While the results pave the way for a new needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market, they were slightly below some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's stock to decline. The data also showed that about a quarter of patients on the highest dose discontinued treatment for various reasons, including gastrointestinal side effects, tempering some of the enthusiasm.</p>

England has struggled in Australia, having not won a Test match there since their victorious 2010-11 tour, a trend McGrath expects to continue despite admiring England's aggressive style of play under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>
