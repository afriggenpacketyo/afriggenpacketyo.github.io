This approach involves accepting emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents prioritize self-awareness and inner healing, creating an environment where children feel secure expressing their authentic selves. Practicing this involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair after conflicts. </p>
