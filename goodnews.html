          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting the latter sovereignty over the Chagos Islands while allowing the UK and US to continue operating a strategically important military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years. In exchange, Mauritius will receive a multi-billion pound payment, with the UK government yet to disclose the exact cost to taxpayers. The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, and Mauritius argues it was illegally forced to give away the islands for independence in 1968. The Labour government argues that the deal guarantees the future of the military base, which is essential to the UK's security and its relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he is seriously considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public. These government-sponsored enterprises play a critical role in America's housing finance system by buying mortgages from lenders and bundling them into mortgage-backed securities. Trump stated that these companies are performing well and generating significant cash, making it an opportune time to explore this transition. He plans to consult with his economic advisors before making a final decision on the matter.</p>

          <p>The leaders of the United States Institute for Peace regained control of their offices after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover by DOGE (a cost-cutting team run by Elon Musk) as "unlawful" and "null and void". The ruling followed a lawsuit by USIP's leaders, who were forcibly removed from the organization's building in March. The judge's order effectively reversed the president's dismissal of the board of directors, with USIP resuming its mission to provide analysis, education, and resources for peace around the world.</p>

          <p>US researchers propose a novel strategy of treating mosquitoes with malaria drugs to prevent them from spreading the disease. The approach involves coating bed nets with a drug cocktail that, when absorbed through the mosquitoes' legs, clears their infection. The Harvard University team found a pair of drugs that successfully rids the insects of malaria. Current efforts focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, but mosquitoes have become resistant, making this new method potentially more effective.</p>

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the UK's NHS to offer additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates. A Cambridge University-led study found that alternative scanning methods could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in this group, which is at higher risk. Traditional mammograms are less effective for dense breasts due to the similar appearance of cancers and dense tissue on x-rays. The study suggests that enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans could identify thousands of extra cancers each year, potentially saving hundreds of lives.</p>
