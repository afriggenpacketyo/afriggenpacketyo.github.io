          <p>The Justice Secretary announced new measures to alleviate overcrowding in England and Wales prisons by limiting the time some offenders spend in jail after breaching their licenses. This shake-up will release offenders after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up around 1,400 prison places and giving ministers time to overhaul the system. While a ¬£4.7bn investment will fund more prisons, the Justice Secretary warned that this would not solve the crisis alone. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, excluding those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>House Republicans advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, after overnight debate in the House Ways and Means Committee. A key point of contention remains the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), with some lawmakers pushing for a higher limit than the proposed $30,000 for those with incomes under $400,000. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to fund the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The full House vote is expected soon, but the legislation faces potential changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Four men were recently found guilty in Kenya of attempting to smuggle thousands of ants, highlighting a growing issue of biopiracy and illegal wildlife trade. The incident underscores how the illegal wildlife trade is expanding beyond large mammals to include smaller, ecologically significant species. Smuggling ants is considered biopiracy, infringing on the Nagoya Protocol, which aims to fairly share the benefits of genetic resources. The article also warns about the potential for zoonotic diseases arising from the unhygienic transport of wild animals, posing a risk to human health.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The ACLU argued that Suri's detention was based on his pro-Palestinian speech, protected under the First Amendment, and his wife's connections to the Gaza foreign ministry and a deceased Hamas leader. The judge agreed that Suri is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, ordering his release on bail while he continues to participate in separate removal proceedings.

          <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies have created uncertainty for American consumers, prompting concerns about higher prices and potential shortages. A recent U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would cut tariffs on American goods to 10%. A trade agreement with the United Kingdom will also cut tariffs on cars and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. To mitigate the impact, experts recommend looking for sales, checking product origins, purchasing domestic products, and prioritizing essential items.</p>
