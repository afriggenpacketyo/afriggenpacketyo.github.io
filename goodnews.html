          <p>Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a significant tool for India's cultural diplomacy and global influence, often referred to as its "soft power." Promoted heavily by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the United Nations declared June 21st as the International Day of Yoga, cementing its status as a symbol of Indian national identity. While the practice fosters people-to-people connections and projects a non-threatening image of India, its global expansion has also faced criticism for over-commercialization and cultural appropriation in the West. The article explores how this cultural export has become a multi-billion dollar global industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, showed that prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased slightly to 2.9% year-over-year, its highest level since February. The report also indicated robust consumer spending, which grew by 0.5%, suggesting economic resilience despite ongoing price pressures. These figures present a mixed picture for the Federal Reserve as it weighs a potential interest rate cut later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that would likely facilitate defender Marc Guehi's anticipated transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million deal for the England international, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly stated his desire to keep Guehi, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is actively pursuing replacements to strengthen its defense.</p>

He reached the 12,388-foot summit on August 5, surpassing the previous record he set himself at the age of 96. Akuzawa undertook the challenging ascent over three days, having overcome significant health issues earlier in the year, including heart failure. His remarkable achievement was the result of a dedicated training regimen that included daily walks and weekly climbs on a smaller mountain, demonstrating incredible resilience and determination.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares climbed 10% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by strong performance in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, the significant profit increase was also aided by gains from equity investments. The results highlight Alibaba's successful strategy of balancing investment in competitive areas like AI and e-commerce while maintaining growth. (not investment advice)</p>
