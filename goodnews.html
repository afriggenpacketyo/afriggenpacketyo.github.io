          <h2>Researchers Explore Why Red Wine is More Likely to Cause Headaches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 07:01:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine consumption is more likely to result in headaches compared to white wine or sparkling wine. One theory suggests that quercetin, a flavanol found in higher concentrations in red wines, may interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that can cause headaches. Growing methods and wine-making processes can affect quercetin levels. Experts also note that alcohol, histamines, and tannins may contribute to red wine headaches and also that headaches may curb overall alcohol intake, which is better for our health and well-being.</p>

He acknowledges that he is now a better communicator and teammate, having matured and gained a greater sense of self. Itoje emphasizes that his experiences both domestically and internationally have provided him with valuable insights that he can rely on in his leadership role. At 21 or 22, you are a little bit brash and a bit naive, but now there's a whole load of experiences that I can count on and rely on.</p>

          <p>Li Auto CEO acknowledges DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and his fight against laziness. Li credited Liang‚Äôs open-source approach to AI development, which serves DeepSeek well and provides a guidepost for Li Auto‚Äôs ambitions of expanding into AI and producing humanoid robots. Liang‚Äôs efforts in leading DeepSeek‚Äôs ascent as a true innovator in AI , overshadowing larger technology companies and a bevy of start-ups in the fast-developing industry. DeepSeek generated worldwide attention in late December 2024 and January by consecutively releasing two advanced open-source AI models, V3 and R1 , which were built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major tech companies typically require for developing large language models (LLMs).</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement on tariffs for specific goods traded between the two countries, though it is not a full trade deal. The deal reduces or eliminates tariffs on some UK exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have been scrapped, though quotas will be imposed. The agreement is the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Surgeon General, advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction as a key factor in chronic disease. Metabolic dysfunction occurs when the body cannot properly process food, leading to symptoms and health risks. Means warns about the impact of ultraprocessed foods, chemicals, and pesticides on metabolic health, with many Americans suffering from the condition. Experts emphasize the importance of lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, to maintain metabolic health, while also addressing challenges related to education and access to healthy resources.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires, new forms of construction are taking root. The region needs to rebuild more than 16,000 buildings, leading to what was once considered ‚Äúalternative‚Äù or ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù becoming standard. Some of the key techniques that could play a role in rebuilding L.A. are 3D-printed construction, container-based construction, panelized construction, and modular construction. The shift is driven by the need for faster, cheaper, and more reliable building methods in the face of bureaucratic hurdles, limited labor, and high materials costs.</p>
