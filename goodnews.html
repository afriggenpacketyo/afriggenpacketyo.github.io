          <h2>Meteor Fragments Believed to Have Landed in Scottish Highlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 02:15:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland after it was seen streaking across the sky. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely broke up about 12 miles above the ground, scattering potential debris over a vast area near Ben Nevis. Dozens of residents reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with one witness describing their house shaking from the impact. Hillwalkers are being asked to look for the meteorite pieces, though finding them in the mountainous terrain will be challenging.</p>

          <p>In a campaign-style rally in Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the narrow passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major tax-and-spending package, calling it a perfect birthday present for America. He used the event, officially the launch of the nation's 250th-anniversary celebration, to mock opponents and repeat false claims about the previous election. Trump also previewed ambitious plans for the 2026 "America 250" events, including a national state fair, a "Patriot Games" for athletes, and a UFC championship fight to be held on the White House lawn for 25,000 spectators.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu is set to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon, a significant step up in competition. After a strong performance to defeat a former champion, Raducanu acknowledges the need to improve her game and add more "weapons" to compete with the sport's top elite. Sabalenka is the overwhelming favorite for the title, known for her powerful serve and aggressive baseline game that has led her to the semi-finals in her last two Wimbledon appearances. Raducanu hopes that playing on home turf will help her rise to the occasion.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he "understands what anchors" US President Donald Trump, citing a personal connection built on shared family values. In a BBC interview, Starmer claimed this good relationship was instrumental in securing a vital trade deal that removed some UK industries from sweeping US tariffs. He revealed that Trump had called to console him after the death of his brother, forging a point of connection despite their different political backgrounds. Starmer argued that building such personal rapports with world leaders is crucial for advancing the UK's national interests.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered his strongest performance of the season, leading the team to a 6-2 victory and a series sweep against the Chicago White Sox. The right-hander pitched into the eighth inning for the first time in his career, taking a perfect game into the sixth and striking out nine batters. May's consistency has been a crucial stabilizing force for a Dodgers pitching staff that has been decimated by injuries this season. His dominant outing, supported by key offensive contributions, provides a significant boost for the team as they continue their winning streak.</p>

          <p>The medical device company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the advanced technology. The device functions differently from traditional hearing aids by bypassing damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals. An external processor with a noise-canceling microphone captures sound, offering a solution for users with severe to profound hearing loss. The launch was facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong, highlighting a rapid entry into the significant Chinese healthcare market.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has renewed its commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and intense, low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated that it will comprehensively address "disorderly low-price competition" and guide companies toward phasing out outdated production capacity. This directive, echoing recent comments from President Xi Jinping, aims to promote healthy and sustainable development in the sector. The meeting with industry leaders acknowledged the difficulties they face while urging them to consolidate China's dominant position in the global solar market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. The visit, organized with the state's Democratic Party, will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties. While Newsom's advisors insist the trip is aimed at helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting issues in rural communities, the choice of location is politically significant. Newsom has made several similar overtures to Southern voters in recent years, including a high-profile debate with Florida's governor.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a significant breakthrough in organ cultivation by growing a human-like heart structure within a pig embryo. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, involved reprogramming human stem cells to improve their survival before implanting them into pig embryos. The resulting chimeric heart structure was able to develop and beat on its own for 21 days. This advancement follows the team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs and marks a critical step forward in the field of generating human organs for transplantation.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken an individual into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The person traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out of the mine-strewn area by a military team. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the individual is unarmed and will be investigated by relevant authorities to determine their identity and motives. The military noted that no unusual movements were detected from the North Korean side during the incident, which comes amid recently heightened border tensions.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released from an ICE detention center after being held for more than four months. Sakeik was detained in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having lived in the U.S. since she was a child and complying with check-in requirements. During her confinement, the government twice attempted to deport her, even after a judge had barred her removal. Sakeik, who was born in Saudi Arabia to a family from Gaza, described harrowing conditions in detention and the fear of being criminalized for being stateless.</p>
