          <p>A Chapel Hill fire chief's dog, Colton, inadvertently started a fire at his owner's home after finding and chewing on a lithium-ion battery. The fire department released a video of the incident, explaining that the dog's chewing broke the battery's protective features, causing it to ignite. Fortunately, the dog was unharmed aside from minor smoke exposure, and the fire damage was contained to a rug, prompting the department to issue a public reminder about the safe storage of such batteries.</p>

          <p>The article explores whether it is more advantageous to purchase annuities during periods of high or low interest rates, a relevant question as the Federal Reserve begins to cut its benchmark rate. It explains that higher interest rates generally result in more generous payouts for fixed annuities, as insurance companies can earn more on the invested premiums. However, it also cautions against trying to perfectly time the market, suggesting that the best time to buy is when rates are reasonably attractive and the security of a guaranteed income stream fits an individual's retirement strategy.
