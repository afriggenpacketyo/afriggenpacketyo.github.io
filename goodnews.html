        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the 4,000 National Guard members from their controversial protest-related deployment in Los Angeles to assist with California's wildfire response. The request comes as the state prepares for an anticipated early and active fire season. This potential shift follows legal challenges from Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued the initial deployment by the Trump administration was illegal and had depleted the state's crucial firefighting resources ahead of peak season.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure firm Cloudflare has announced it will begin blocking AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move that could reshape how AI models are trained. This new policy will require website owners to explicitly grant permission for their content to be used, aiming to restore control and potential revenue to creators. The change addresses growing concerns that AI companies are harvesting vast quantities of text and images without consent or compensation, thereby depriving publishers of traffic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece posits that the victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral primary provides a potential blueprint for the national Democratic party. The author contends that Mamdani's success stemmed from a practical platform focused on affordability, a principled stance on foreign policy, and the effective mobilization of a young, diverse, and working-class voter base. His campaign's ability to triumph over a rival with a massive financial advantage suggests that grassroots organizing can be a powerful force in modern politics.</p>

          <p>In an effort to bolster foreign investor confidence amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and Europe, China has unveiled new tax incentives. The policy allows foreign companies to deduct 10% of their onshore tax liability for profits that are reinvested back into their Chinese operations. This move is part of a wider government strategy to signal that China remains an open and attractive market for international business and to encourage long-term capital commitment within the country.

          <p>Ornithologists from UCLA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County have launched "Project Phoenix," a citizen science initiative to investigate how birds are affected by wildfire smoke. The project is recruiting volunteers across the West Coast to spend ten minutes each week observing and recording bird activity in their local areas. By collecting this data, researchers hope to understand how smoke and soot impact bird behavior, migration, and health, ultimately informing conservation efforts in an era of worsening fire seasons.</p>

This initiative is vital for research at the McDonald Observatory, beneficial for nocturnal wildlife, and a significant driver of the local tourism economy.</p>

          <p>Consumer price inflation across the euro zone rose slightly to 2.0% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's (ECB) official target. This figure, up from 1.9% in May, aligns with economists' forecasts and reflects a mixed inflation landscape across the bloc's major economies. The data strengthens the view that the ECB will likely hold its key interest rate steady at its upcoming July meeting, having seemingly completed its cycle of interventions to bring inflation down from its peak.

Currently, very few medical residency programs offer dedicated training on the topic, leaving many doctors ill-equipped to treat common symptoms.

          <p>Voting patterns in the 2024 election shifted from the 2020 pandemic peak, with fewer Americans using mail-in ballots, according to a new federal report. Mail voting constituted 30.3% of turnout, down from 43% in 2020 but still above pre-pandemic levels. In-person voting saw a resurgence, particularly early in-person voting, which has become more popular and was offered in some form by every state for the first time. This data suggests voters are adapting their habits and utilizing a variety of convenient methods to cast their ballots.</p>
