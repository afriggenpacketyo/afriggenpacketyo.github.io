          <p>Golfer Scottie Scheffler's choice of an orange outfit during a practice round at Quail Hollow Golf Club drew attention, as it resembled the jumpsuit he wore in his arrest mugshot from the previous year's PGA Championship. Scheffler, who was arrested on his way to the tournament last year but had all charges dropped, downplayed the outfit's significance, suggesting it might simply be a nod to the University of Texas Longhorns. The article provides context on the incident, noting it occurred after a fatal accident outside the Louisville course and that Scheffler faced charges including assaulting a police officer.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Saudi Arabia, President Trump criticized Western intervention and nation-building, declaring that the United States would no longer lecture other countries on how to live, a statement that garnered applause from his audience. This stance reflects a shift from previous American policy in the Middle East, resonating with long-held grievances about U.S. involvement in the region. However, reactions were mixed, with some expressing skepticism and concern about the potential impact on human rights and regional stability. Trump also expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
