          <p>The annual Chicago Marathon is taking place with an undercurrent of tension due to increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the city as part of a federal push called "Operation Midway Blitz." While organizers and Mayor Brandon Johnson have encouraged participation as a form of resistance to what they term federal overreach, the recent raids have created fear, particularly in Latino neighborhoods like Pilsen, which is on the marathon route. Community groups are present as a precaution, and some undocumented runners have been hesitant to join group events, though local businesses remain hopeful for a successful day.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league coach, Shaun Wane, is facing several selection challenges ahead of announcing his squad for the upcoming Ashes Test series against Australia. Key decisions are needed in the halves, with strong Grand Final performances from players like Mikey Lewis creating competition for established choices. There is also a dilemma at hooker and a wealth of options in the three-quarters, requiring tough calls on which in-form players to include. The selection process is crucial as England aims to secure its first series victory over the Kangaroos since 1970, with pressure to balance experience with new talent.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Use AI to Uncover Hidden Protein Similarities in Convergent Evolution</h2>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate the genetic basis of convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but this new approach examines complex 3D structural features of proteins that evolved separately but serve a similar function, such as echolocation in bats and dolphins. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights an underappreciated sequence basis for how functional traits can converge, offering new insights into evolutionary processes.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip, with a target of around 600 trucks per day. The United Nations has vast quantities of food and medicine ready for delivery pending Israeli approval. As Palestinians begin returning to their neighborhoods, many are finding their homes reduced to rubble after two years of devastating war. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with U.S. President Trump expected to visit the region to oversee the implementation of the peace plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of top-tier footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches to supplement their club training and gain a competitive advantage. These external coaches provide highly personalized, one-on-one sessions that focus on fine-tuning specific skills and scenarios that may not be addressed in a group setting. While players see it as a way to build confidence and work on weaknesses, the practice raises concerns for clubs about player fatigue and potential injuries. Most private coaches emphasize the importance of open communication and collaboration with the player's club to ensure the training is complementary and safe.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most ambitious infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, dubbed a "project of the century" due to its immense engineering challenges and cost. The line will traverse treacherous terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost zones, at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. With an estimated investment that could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), it is set to be one of China's most expensive rail projects ever. The railway is strategically important for Beijing, aiming to boost economic development, integration, and security in these two vast autonomous regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has started the gradual implementation of its long-delayed digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES). The system will track when non-EU citizens, including those from the UK, enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area, eventually replacing manual passport stamping. Travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial image, on their first use, which will be valid for three years. While the system aims to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns remain about potential delays and queues at key transit points like Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial rollout phase.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has committed to creating a formal plan for an independent Wales, though its leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, clarified this would not happen within the first term of a Plaid-led government. At the party's conference, members endorsed a proposal to establish a "standing commission" to engage the public on the country's constitutional future and prepare a white paper detailing a path to independence. This represents a strategic shift from the party's previous pledge to hold a referendum within five years, now focusing on a longer-term national conversation about enhancing devolution and eventual sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team head coach, Steve Clarke, has stated that qualifying for the next World Cup would "put right" the team's painful 2022 playoff defeat to Ukraine. Scotland is currently well-positioned in its qualifying group, level on points with leader Denmark, and is favored to win its upcoming match against Belarus. Clarke, who has successfully guided the team to the last two European Championships, is determined to end the nation's 28-year absence from the men's World Cup finals.

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the right for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has sparked a national debate. While some media outlets controversially framed it as "extra holidays," the regulation merely affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to provisions for Catholic and Protestant holidays in various German states. The episode reflects Germany's broader conversation about integration, equality, and cultural identity, showcasing how the country's patchwork of state-regulated public holidays is adapting to its evolving religious demographics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic mechanism that allows a single, non-reproductive plant cell to regenerate into a completely new plant. Published in the journal Cell, their research identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a specialized plant cell back to an embryonic state, a process known as somatic embryogenesis. This fundamental biological insight was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The discovery could have significant implications for agriculture, plant breeding, and biotechnology by providing a deeper understanding of plant regeneration.</p>
