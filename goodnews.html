          <p>A group of House Republicans is requesting that Fiscal Year 2026 spending bills include language prohibiting federal funding for 'transgender' experiments on animals. The letter, addressed to subcommittee leaders, points to NIH grants funding experiments that involve invasive surgeries and hormone therapies to create 'transfeminine' and 'transmasculine' lab animals. These animals are then subjected to disturbing procedures, including being wounded, shocked, and injected with drugs. Republicans argue that taxpayer dollars should not fund these experiments, citing concerns about animal cruelty and wasteful spending, with the White Coat Waste Project supporting the initiative.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, marking his first military commencement address since returning to office, amid a crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding student clubs focused on race and gender and removing books on diversity from academy libraries. Former teachers have criticized these measures, arguing that they stifle intellectual engagement. The address followed Vice President Vance's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, emphasizing a shift away from 'forever wars' and open-ended conflicts, with Trump's address potentially reinforcing his administration's stance on military education and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the significant decrease in violent crime rates across the United States after a pandemic-era spike, highlighting that murder rates are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Early data for 2025 suggests a continued decline, potentially reaching the lowest murder rate in US history. Factors contributing to this drop include the waning of pandemic-related stressors, the reinstatement of social services, and government initiatives aimed at curbing violence. Despite these positive trends, public perception lags behind, with many Americans still believing that crime is on the rise, underscoring the influence of 'bad news bias'.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a significant milestone in underwater communication. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system that can map signal clusters in noisy environments. This advancement could pave the way for the real-life use of long-range undersea messaging, with profound civilian and military applications. The system's ability to function without prior knowledge of seabed topography is particularly advantageous for naval applications.</p>

          <p>This article highlights Fiverr International and Roku as two growth stocks that Wall Street may be underestimating. Despite strong revenue growth and free cash flow, Fiverr has a lukewarm analyst rating and high short interest. Similarly, Roku, a media-streaming technology expert, is also considered undervalued despite its growth potential. The author argues that both stocks present compelling investment opportunities, citing their proven growth and attractive valuation ratios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifa president Gianni Infantino suggested that Cristiano Ronaldo could potentially participate in the 2025 Club World Cup, despite his club, Al-Nassr, not qualifying. Infantino mentioned ongoing discussions with clubs interested in hiring Ronaldo for the tournament. The expanded 32-team Club World Cup will be played in the summer, and Fifa has introduced an additional transfer window to facilitate deals for players like Ronaldo. This opens the possibility for Ronaldo, whose contract with Al-Nassr expires in June, to join a team participating in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Despite criticisms that the movement to defund the police failed, cities like Austin and Seattle are seeing progress in implementing alternatives to traditional law enforcement. Following the murder of George Floyd, these cities have invested in social services, mental health crisis response units, and participatory budgeting. While initial promises to cut police funding were often reversed, the lasting impact includes increased investment in housing, healthcare, and community-led initiatives. These changes reflect a shift towards reimagining public safety and addressing the root causes of crime.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK employees work from home more than most global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week remotely. Hybrid working is now the dominant model in advanced economies, especially in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to commuting costs and length. Despite some companies enforcing return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized. The study also indicates that younger workers prefer office work for networking, while parents favor hybrid models.</p>

          <p>A 2-month-old black bear cub, rescued from the Los Padres National Forest, is being raised at the San Diego Humane Society‚Äôs Ramona Wildlife Center by humans dressed in bear costumes. This unusual approach aims to prevent the cub from imprinting on humans, increasing its chances of being successfully returned to the wild. The cub, found underweight and weak, requires four enrichment and feeding sessions daily. The wildlife center hopes to rehabilitate the bear for up to a year and eventually release it back into its natural habitat.</p>
