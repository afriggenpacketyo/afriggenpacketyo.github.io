        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors President Mark Reuss has spearheaded a decade-long initiative to revitalize Cadillac, aiming to restore its status as the leading American luxury car brand. The strategy involves focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade, with an emphasis on unique Cadillac designs and technology rather than shared GM components. Despite challenges including sales declines in China and initial EV production setbacks, Cadillac has largely adhered to its plan, prioritizing brand value and consistency. The brand is relaunching the Celestiq, a bespoke, hand-built vehicle, as part of this effort. </p>

Alipay noted that transactions and total spending by inbound travelers using 13 e-wallets in its network doubled compared to the previous year, attributing this growth to China's updated tax refund and visa-free policies. Similarly, WeChat Pay reported a nearly threefold increase in transactions from foreign users in mainland China during the first three days of the holiday, with transaction volumes from Hong Kong WeChat Pay users doubling year-on-year.

          <p>As the Trump administration considers policies to boost the birth rate, analysts are suggesting that these policies should embrace the diverse family structures that exist in the U.S. today. Rather than focusing solely on promoting marriage, the administration could lower barriers for all people hoping to start families, including single parents and those using assisted reproductive technologies. A focus on supporting existing families, such as extended family support and paid leave policies, would benefit children regardless of household structure. The article suggests a broad approach to supporting families that accounts for varying household arrangements. </p>
