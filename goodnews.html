          <p>An adolescent loggerhead sea turtle named Dilly Dally was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after undergoing rehabilitation at a Florida turtle hospital. Dilly Dally had its front flipper amputated due to predator wounds sustained in January. The veterinary crew at Loggerhead Marinelife Center assisted in the turtle's recovery, and a crowd of beachgoers cheered as Dilly Dally made its way back to the water. A satellite tracking device was attached to the turtle's shell, allowing the center and the public to monitor its journey and gather data on the migration patterns of three-flippered turtles, aiding in future patient care and species conservation.</p>

          <p>A private lunar lander from Japan, developed by ispace, is attempting a moon landing in the unexplored far north, carrying a mini rover. Named Resilience, this mission follows a previous crash landing by the company two years prior. The lander carries a rover named Tenacious, equipped with a camera and shovel to collect lunar dirt for NASA. The mission aims to contribute to establishing lunar infrastructure for a permanent human presence, and follows successful landings by Firefly Aerospace and Intuitive Machines, the latter of which crashed on landing.</p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced its plans to move its primary listing location to the U.S., a move that is considered a blow to the London stock exchange. Wise will transition to a dual listing, with its main listing hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This decision would allow Wise's shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the LSE, with shares of Wise trading higher following the announcement. The company cited its full-year earnings statement as the basis for the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the popular narrative that China's rise gutted American manufacturing, the negative effects of trade with China have been exaggerated. A comprehensive review suggests that populist narratives blaming this trade for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. The steady decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China‚Äôs WTO entry, mainly due to technological advances and shifting consumer demand. The real shock America faces in 2025 is not from Chinese imports, but from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem, with the path forward harnessing trade's real benefits rather than chasing economic illusions.

          <p>Despite efforts to keep Altadena local, developers are buying up burned lots following the Eaton fire, outpacing sales in the Palisades market. Roughly 145 lots have sold, with about 100 currently listed and more in escrow, raising concerns about gentrification and the loss of Altadena's unique charm. While some vilify developers, others argue they are necessary for rebuilding the community, which faces bureaucratic challenges. The influx of developers has caused concern among locals that the new builds won‚Äôt match the charm and quirks of Altadena, where century-old Craftsmans mingle with Colonial Revivals and English Tudors.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering policy changes to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes after the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. A bill, AB 226, would make the FAIR Plan eligible for loans and bonds from the state-backed California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank to avoid financial collapse after a disaster. Other bills being considered would protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline the claims process, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. Most of the legislation aims to prevent and prepare for future fires, easing the permit process for rebuilding and extending provisions set by the governor during the state of emergency.</p>

          <p>As Elon Musk shifts his focus back to Tesla after a stint in Washington, the company faces several challenges, including rebuilding its reputation, delivering on autonomous driving technology, keeping up with competition, and completing a charging network. Musk's association with the Trump administration alienated customers, and the company's brand sustained damage. To remain viable, Tesla will have to reassess aspects of its business model, such as launching an affordable model and navigating the potential loss of a federal electric vehicle credit. The future of the company depends on whether he can follow through on autonomous driving technology, with the industry needing significant progress on the network of charging stations.</p>

          <p>A writer explores the world of personalized perfume styling by hiring Anna Dorn, a perfume stylist who offers scent fittings over text message. The process involves describing desired scents using evocative phrases and adjectives, rather than simply listing notes, leading to a selection of niche fragrances. This journey highlights the growing interest in scent as a nuanced form of self-expression, akin to storytelling and world-building. Rather than finding a signature scent, the experience becomes about developing the confidence to articulate the right scent for the right occasion, celebrating the multitudes we contain.</p>
