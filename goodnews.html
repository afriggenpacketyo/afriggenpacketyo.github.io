          <h2>UK Energy Bills to Decrease Slightly in July Due to Falling Wholesale Gas Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 02:41:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to an annual bill decrease of ¬£129 for a typical household, bringing the average bill down to ¬£1,720. The decrease reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, but charities warn that many people are still struggling with energy costs and debt. While this offers some relief, prices remain higher than previous years, and customer debt to suppliers remains a significant concern. </p>

          <h2>Japan's Childless Elderly Turning Wealth Into Goodwill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 23:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In aging Japan, an increasing number of elderly individuals without children are opting for bequest donations to hospitals and nonprofits. This trend is driven by the rise in childless couples with no heirs, leading to a surge in money nestling in the national treasury. Organizations are now bridging the gap between donors and recipients through wills and trusts. This allows seniors to contribute to causes they care about, providing them with relief and a sense of purpose. </p>
