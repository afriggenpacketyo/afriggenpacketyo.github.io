          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has clarified that his department is legally obligated to honor judicial warrants issued by federal judges for the transfer of inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He distinguished these mandatory warrants, which are based on criminal charges, from civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor in accordance with state and local sanctuary policies. Luna made these remarks to address community fears, emphasizing that the department does not participate in ICE's street-level immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with "REAL Cane Sugar" in its signature soda, a move he championed as an improvement. This article analyzes the announcement, noting that while many consumers prefer the taste of cane sugar-sweetened Coke, health experts assert there is virtually no metabolic difference between the two sweeteners. The move is framed as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, despite its limited actual health benefits.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures and that the 3.4-ounce liquid limit might be the next policy to change. This follows the recent and immediate termination of the rule requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screening. Noem envisions a future of streamlined airport security, enabled by multilayered screening processes and advanced technology.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, as female members of Congress from both parties teamed up to play against members of the media. The event, co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own cancer diagnosis, serves as a major fundraiser for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Since its inception, the game has raised nearly $5 million, demonstrating a shared commitment to a cause that transcends political divisions.</p>

          <p>A uniquely ancient ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Scientists will carefully melt the cylinder, which was drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the ancient dust, ash, and air bubbles trapped inside. This material holds vital information about Earth's climate during a period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. Researchers hope the data will revolutionize our understanding of past climate shifts and improve future climate change models.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slight decline in the rate of rice price increases, although overall inflation has now exceeded the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data comes amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs, keeping pressure on the central bank regarding future monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

As a result, some consumers may be denied BNPL credit, and users will gain rights such as the ability to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common circulatory condition, following a comprehensive medical exam. The disclosure came after photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swelling in his legs prompted public speculation about his health. According to a note from the White House physician, the condition is benign, common in people over 70, and is not indicative of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The physician affirmed that the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>This article provides a medical explanation of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the circulatory condition President Trump was recently diagnosed with. CVI occurs when damaged valves in leg veins have difficulty returning blood to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, varicose veins, and skin discoloration. According to medical experts, the condition is common, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, and is typically managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes to improve circulation.</p>
