          <h2>Body Fat Percentage a More Accurate Predictor of Mortality Risk Than BMI, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body fat percentage is a much more accurate indicator of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that over a 15-year period, individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die than those with healthy levels. The study criticizes BMI for its inability to distinguish between muscle and fat, rendering it an unreliable health metric for many individuals, such as bodybuilders. The findings suggest that more accessible methods for measuring body fat, like bioelectrical impedance analysis, should become a standard part of health screenings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent use of an expletive during a press conference about the Iran-Israel conflict, marking a rare instance of a U.S. president swearing deliberately on camera. The author suggests that while unconventional, the moment came across as authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many observers. The piece argues that in an era of polished and often distrusted political speech, occasional and judicious use of such language can make politicians appear more human and relatable. It contrasts this with the heavily scripted nature of most political communication, which can create a disconnect with the public.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN Refugee Agency, Filippo Grandi, has voiced concern over the new German government's decision to temporarily suspend its participation in the UN's refugee resettlement program. Germany had previously pledged to accept 13,000 vulnerable refugees in 2024 and 2025 through the program, which helps individuals who cannot remain safely in their initial host countries. The article also notes that former Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a farewell speech at the Social Democratic Party congress. In his address, Scholz defended his government's policies and warned against underestimating Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine.</p>

He described the intensity of learning to drive Formula 1 cars at speeds up to 180 mph on iconic tracks, a process supported by F1 champion Sir Lewis Hamilton, who is a producer on the film. Idris, known for his breakout role in "Snowfall," views this major Hollywood film as a new chapter in his career. He also lightheartedly recounted the challenge of trying to "look cute" while acting under the extreme physical forces of high-speed driving.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder marked his return to the ring with a seventh-round technical knockout victory against Tyrrell Herndon. This was Wilder's first win since 2022, following a difficult period that included three losses in his last four fights. The low-key comeback bout saw a more measured Wilder, who utilized his jab and set up his punches rather than relying solely on his famous right-hand power. While the win puts him back on a positive track, Wilder acknowledged he is on a new beginning and aims to become a more complete fighter before targeting the division's elite again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a significant advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its existing digital payment infrastructure. The research note suggests that platforms like WeChat and Alipay already function much like stablecoins, offering digital money pegged 1:1 to the fiat currency. These systems are supported by a mature regulatory framework that requires customer funds to be fully backed by central bank money. This existing ecosystem could provide a strong foundation for China to lead in the broader field of platform-based digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

This minimally invasive technique avoids the need for open-skull surgery, such as the method used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, thereby reducing risk and recovery time. In the trial, a stent electrode was inserted into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein in a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke. The breakthrough procedure reportedly helped the patient regain some limb movement, representing a significant advance in neurotechnology.</p>
