          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 16th home run for the Los Angeles Dodgers in a 6-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. Ohtani's solo shot in the eighth inning narrowed the gap, but the Angels had already established an early lead with a two-run homer by Yoan Moncada. Seiya Suzuki had a strong performance for the Chicago Cubs, driving in two runs in their 13-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. Suzuki expressed gratitude towards his teammates for creating scoring opportunities and welcomed Kenta Maeda to the Cubs after he signed a minor league contract.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups in the Americas can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic codes that changed in people from different geographical regions and various Indigenous groups. This allowed them to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years and understand the origins of South American communities.</p>

          <p>Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St Lucia sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, signaling China's flexible approach to courting Taipei's remaining allies. Analysts suggest this participation doesn't necessarily indicate a shift in allegiance, but rather a pragmatic diplomacy trend. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had notified them in advance and that relations remained stable. This event underscores Beijing's ongoing efforts to assert its position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for its presidential election, with voters heading to the polls to choose between left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki. The outcome will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can advance its reform plans, which have been obstructed by the current president. Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, aims to restore the rule of law and liberalize social policies, while Nawrocki, supported by the opposition, advocates for conservative values and skepticism towards the EU. The election's result will significantly impact Poland's political direction.</p>

The storm, fueled by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, caused drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony.

Trump secured economic investments and praised the wealth of his hosts, while also holding campaign-style rallies at U.S. military facilities. The visit underscored the transactional nature of U.S. relations with the Gulf states, where human rights concerns were largely overlooked.</p>

          <p>As the United States reduces its investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its influence through strategic investments in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. Emirati investments in Africa have surged, dwarfing amounts pledged by other countries. This expansion is part of a plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the UAE is considered a reliable ally by Washington, its economic partnership with China and involvement in conflicts raise concerns about its long-term impact on the continent.</p>

Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, details the children's initial hostility, poor manners, and fear, as well as the abuse they endured within the cult, including physical punishment and denial of parental relationships. Over time, the children began to heal, forming bonds with caregivers and rediscovering their childlike selves.
