          <p>Two winning tickets have been sold for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest prize in the game's history. The winning numbers were drawn Saturday, ending a three-month period without a jackpot winner. The Texas ticket was sold at a convenience store in Fredericksburg, while the Missouri winner's location has not yet been announced. Winners can choose between a lump sum payment of approximately $826.4 million before taxes or an annuity paid out over 30 years.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to release over 300 of its nationals who were detained during a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle plant in Georgia. The raid, which targeted suspected undocumented workers, was part of a broader investigation into unlawful employment practices. South Korea, a key U.S. ally, had expressed significant concern over the detentions and plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home once administrative procedures are complete.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles women's rugby team has been eliminated from the World Cup despite a dominant 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England was sufficient to secure them a quarter-final spot based on point differential, ending the American campaign. Despite the disappointment, the team's performance highlighted the emergence of promising young talent, such as 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa. This new generation of players provides a strong sense of optimism for the team's prospects in the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical actions new parents can take for their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for cognitive development, emotional regulation, and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, involving both parents in settling routines, and ensuring the baby is well-fed. He stresses that while routines are helpful, flexibility is key to reducing parental stress and responding to a baby's individual needs.</p>

          <p>A 1,600-year-old care facility for the elderly has been discovered by archaeologists in the ruins of the ancient Christian city of Hippos, near the Sea of Galilee. Researchers from the University of Haifa identified the building's purpose from a mosaic at its entrance inscribed with the Greek message, "Peace be with the elders." This discovery provides rare physical evidence of social institutions dedicated to the care and dignity of seniors during the Byzantine era, suggesting that such concern is not just a modern concept.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Solar Power Aligns with Conservative Prepper Ideology</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that right-wing preppers, who prioritize self-sufficiency in anticipation of societal collapse, should logically embrace solar energy. While traditionally associated with fossil fuels, the article argues that solar panels paired with batteries offer a more resilient and individualistic power source than a complex and fragile fuel supply chain. Solar energy provides long-term, decentralized power with minimal maintenance, making it an ideal technology for anyone, regardless of political affiliation, seeking to be independent from established systems during an emergency.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick achieved his first victory as head coach of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed reports about his relationship with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC practices. Belichick stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure from the NFL team where he won six Super Bowls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns over climate policy, China's strategy to ramp up coal power capacity is being viewed as a necessary measure to support its massive expansion of renewable energy. The article suggests that coal plants are acting as a "shock absorber" for the energy grid. This backup power provides stability and prevents blackouts during periods of high demand or when hydropower output is low, giving grid operators the confidence to continue connecting record amounts of new solar and wind power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Plumas Bancorp's ownership structure reveals that retail investors are the largest shareholder group, controlling 50% of the company. Institutional investors hold a significant 39% stake, while insiders own shares worth approximately $23 million. This distribution suggests that the general public has considerable influence over the NASDAQ-listed company's management and governance decisions. The report notes that while institutional ownership implies analyst confidence, the large public holding gives smaller investors a powerful collective voice in corporate policy.

          <p>The second-hand marketplace Vinted, now valued at over a billion dollars, originated from a common problem: having too many clothes. In 2008, co-founder Milda Mitkutė needed to downsize before moving to a smaller apartment and, with friend Justas Janauskas, created a simple website to sell her unwanted items. The concept quickly gained popularity through word-of-mouth, expanding from Lithuania to Germany and evolving into the global platform it is today. The company overcame early financial struggles to become a major player in the sustainable fashion movement.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Powerball data highlights how state taxes significantly impact the take-home amount for jackpot winners. Following the recent $1.8 billion jackpot, a winner in a state with no lottery tax, such as Texas or Florida, would receive substantially more than a winner in a high-tax state like New York. The report details the tax implications, noting that federal taxes take an initial 24% withholding with more due later, while state taxes can range from zero to over 10%, creating a wide disparity in the final payout.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell, 21, has expressed that he feels he should have played more during his first home summer in international cricket. After a promising debut Test series last winter, Bethell found his opportunities limited, missing a Test for the Indian Premier League and subsequently losing his place in the starting lineup. The all-rounder acknowledged that spending time on the sidelines was a learning experience and that he should have sought more playing time in domestic cricket to stay in form.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, known as the "silent killer," affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. For those with higher readings, medications are recommended, with new drug classes targeting the hormone aldosterone showing promise for patients who don't respond well to existing treatments.</p>
