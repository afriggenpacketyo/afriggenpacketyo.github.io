          <p>According to the New York Times, Britain is on track to become the first nation to finalize a trade agreement with the United States following the imposition of tariffs. While the White House and British Embassy have not commented, a UK Department for Business and Trade spokesperson stated that discussions are underway with the U.S., emphasizing the importance of the alliance and aiming for a resolution that benefits both UK businesses and consumers. It remains unclear whether the agreement will be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, especially given conflicting statements from U.S. officials regarding the necessity of formal trade deals. This development follows previous indications of a potential agreement and the U.K.'s avoidance of higher reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, though specifics remain unclear. This would be the first deal since the administration imposed tariffs last month. The announcement follows weeks of talks, with the UK seeking tariff relief on steel, aluminum, and cars in exchange for a lower digital services tax. The UK is also prioritizing an agreement with the EU, potentially aligning standards with Europe and potentially ruling out reducing food production standards to accommodate US agricultural products.</p>

          <p>The article explores the current crisis of global capitalism, noting its historical context and the challenges of finding a new economic paradigm. It highlights concerns about inequality, climate change, and the power of big tech, with both left and right-leaning thinkers criticizing the current system. The article discusses potential solutions such as degrowth, green growth, and a new form of managed capitalism, while also acknowledging the difficulties in implementing these changes and the political forces that resist them. The author writes, in containing capitalism within a new set of rules and social norms, postwar Keynesian social democracy seemingly refuted Polanyi‚Äôs argument, which he made during the 1930s, that socialism or fascism was the logical end point of the system.</p>

A study estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the lunar soil within the top 10 meters, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. The findings could aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon, opening a new pathway to investigate water abundances.</p>
