          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper commented that while the Federal Reserve has room for a few more interest rate cuts, excessive easing could push the economy into a "danger territory." He expressed concern that further rate reductions, especially while inflation is not fully controlled, might reignite price pressures by boosting demand faster than supply and potentially create asset bubbles. Despite finding current market valuations high, Tepper stated he remains constructive due to the Fed's current easing stance, acknowledging the difficulty of betting against the central bank.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the U.S. government from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan children, sharply criticizing the Trump administration's justification for the action. Judge Timothy Kelly ruled that the administration's argument for reuniting the children with their families in Guatemala "crumbled like a house of cards" upon review. The decision came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the deportations, which advocates argued were being carried out without due process for minors who may have pending immigration cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in South America, scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and ants, perfectly preserved in 112-million-year-old amber. Found in a sandstone quarry in Ecuador, these specimens provide a rare window into life during the Cretaceous period, a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. The discovery helps fill a major gap in the fossil record, as most similar amber deposits have been found in the Northern Hemisphere, and will aid in understanding ancient biodiversity.</p>

          <h2>Applying Spinoza's Philosophy to Overcome Modern-Day Criticism and 'Cancel Culture'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how the wisdom of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza can be applied to manage the emotional turmoil caused by modern public criticism and online shaming. Spinoza advocated for using reason to understand and regulate emotions, a practice now known as metacognition, which involves observing one's feelings from a distance. By doing so, individuals can avoid being controlled by primal reactions like anger and fear, allowing them to respond to censure with equanimity and maintain their inner peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, described the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut as a "prudent call," signaling the administration's approval of the move. While some within the administration, including President Trump, had advocated for a more aggressive cut, Hassett's conciliatory tone marks a significant departure from the White House's previous harsh public criticism of the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell. The comments suggest a de-escalation of political pressure on the Fed's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants reported mixed quarterly results, narrowly missing Wall Street's earnings expectations but raising its full-year sales forecast. The company's performance was driven by strong same-store sales growth at its casual-dining brands, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, which successfully attracted customers with value offerings. This strength helped to offset continued weakness in its fine-dining segment, indicating a shift in consumer spending habits toward more budget-conscious options.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025 has provided tangible relief to the housing market, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a borrower with a $500,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment that is approximately $300 cheaper than it was at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs enhances affordability for new buyers and creates significant savings opportunities for existing homeowners considering a refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

In a study involving running rats, scientists recorded brain activity showing that certain cells fire in a regular, repeating pattern that correlates with the distance covered. Further experiments with human volunteers suggest the same navigational mechanism exists in our brains, and it can be disrupted when visual landmarks or environmental shapes are altered, impairing our ability to judge distance.</p>
