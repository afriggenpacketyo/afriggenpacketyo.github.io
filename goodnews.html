          <h2>National Park Service Debunks Viral Claims of Mass Wildlife Exodus from Yellowstone</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Park Service has refuted false rumors circulating on social media that suggest wildlife is fleeing Yellowstone National Park in large numbers. Officials state that viral videos showing herds of animals leaving are likely satirical or AI-generated, as there is no evidence of unusual migration patterns. Experts explain that some seasonal migration is normal, particularly in winter, but the current volcanic alert level is normal and there are no environmental triggers for a mass departure. The misinformation raises concerns about undermining public understanding of natural ecosystems and park operations.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the measures due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. After receiving guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security and gas prices, Slovakia has agreed to approve the package. The new sanctions, which require unanimous consent from all 27 member states, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including its crucial Nordstream pipelines.</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, medical experts are providing context on the condition. CVI is a common circulatory issue, especially in older adults, where veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing swelling. The article explains that while the condition is often benign, diagnosis involves ruling out more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods such as compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which aid circulation.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song 'Heterocomía' was a cathartic project, despite the high cost and low potential for profit. To create the track's introduction, she brokered an expensive deal with Disney to sample the theme from the 1970 film 'The Aristocats.' The song, which fans speculate is about a past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia, contrasts a fairy-tale opening with lyrics about deception and revenge. Belinda stated that while she may never see royalties from the song, the personal satisfaction of creating it was worth the expense.</p>
