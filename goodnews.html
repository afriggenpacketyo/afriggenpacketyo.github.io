          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders to discuss a path toward ending the conflict with Russia, with a key outcome being Trump's statement that European countries, coordinated with the U.S., would provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy hailed this as a major step, anticipating a massive purchase of American weapons financed by Europe. While details remain scant, the guarantees aim to deter future Russian aggression, though obstacles like Russia's unchanged maximalist demands and the lack of a ceasefire persist. The overall mood was cautiously optimistic, but many uncertainties surrounding implementation and troop deployments remain.</p>

OpenAI's decision to pilot this plan in India first reflects its strategy to learn from user feedback before a wider global rollout.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has announced a last-minute decision to postpone its documentary "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," which chronicles the rock star's final three years and his death at age 76. This delay was made to honor the wishes of the Osbourne family, who are navigating a difficult period following his recent passing. Originally planned as a 10-part series, the project was condensed into a single film as Ozzy's health deteriorated. The documentary, described as a "moving and inspirational account," was scheduled to air shortly after his funeral, and the BBC is now awaiting a more suitable time for its broadcast. This deferral underscores a commitment to family privacy during a time of public grief.</p>

          <p>The US director of national intelligence has stated that the UK has withdrawn its controversial demand for Apple to provide a "back door" to global users' encrypted data. This demand, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act, had prompted Apple to withdraw its Advanced Data Protection from the UK market and initiate legal challenges, citing its commitment to user privacy. While Apple has not yet received formal communication, privacy campaigners are cautiously optimistic about this development. They warn that the power to demand such access still exists within the Act, posing a future risk to civil liberties and national security if not permanently addressed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing taking a 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This deal could involve converting some of Intel's $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants into equity, reflecting Washington's priority to revive the struggling chipmaker and bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. While the plan's broad traction and certainty remain unclear, it aligns with the administration's interest in fostering national champions in strategic industries. This potential intervention comes as Intel faces challenges in the AI boom and manufacturing, despite a recent $2 billion investment from SoftBank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, a city with nearly 690,000 residents, has achieved a remarkable milestone by recording zero traffic fatalities in the past year, marking its most recent road death in July 2024. This success aligns with the European Union's ambitious "Vision Zero" program, aiming for no road fatalities by 2050. The city's comprehensive Traffic Safety Development Programme attributes this achievement to measures such as reducing speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of its streets and around schools. Additionally, the strategy involves increasing public transport use, leveraging crash data to identify dangerous areas, and implementing 60 fixed speed cameras, making Helsinki a leading example for urban traffic safety.</p>

          <p>Canada's Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, is projected to win a crucial by-election in the rural Battle River-Crowfoot riding in Alberta, securing his return to a Parliament seat. This victory follows his loss of the Ottawa-area seat in the last general election, where his party was defeated by Mark Carney's Liberals. Poilievre, who secured 80.1% of the vote, faced a record 214 candidates, including many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. His projected win allows the 46-year-old to re-enter the House of Commons for the upcoming autumn sitting, a significant step ahead of a mandatory leadership review by Conservative party members in January.</p>

The vast 672-tonne timber structure, once voted Sweden's most beautiful pre-1950 building, is being moved intact on giant rolling platforms at a speed of 500 meters per hour. This move is the most symbolic part of a decades-long project to shift much of the Arctic town of Kiruna, financed by mine operator LKAB. The relocation, while celebrated as an engineering marvel, also highlights the challenges faced by the indigenous Sami community due to mining expansion.</p>
