          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes and 3 to 5 potentially major hurricanes. The article provides the list of names for the 2025 season, including Andrea, Barry, and Chantal, which are part of a rotating six-year cycle managed by the World Meteorological Organization. The practice of naming storms helps with communication and preparation efforts, and names of particularly devastating storms are retired. The list was last used in 2019 and will be used again in 2031, offering a system for tracking and discussing storms effectively. </p>

          <p>Syrians are increasingly calling for peace with Israel, reflecting a notable shift in the country's political landscape as direct talks between Syria and Israel take place. Facilitated by the U.S., these discussions mark a departure from decades of hostility, influenced by a change in U.S. policy following President Trump's meeting with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Syrians express a desire to move beyond the Palestinian cause, focusing on their own country's interests and economic development. The article suggests that this shift in public opinion is driven by a rejection of pro-Palestinian militancy and a hope for improved economic conditions through peace with Israel. </p>
