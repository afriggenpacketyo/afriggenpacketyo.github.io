          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has entered into a major partnership with OpenAI, which could see the AI firm acquire up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker. As part of the deal, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, a move that sent AMD's stock price up by over 25% in premarket trading. The agreement, valued in the billions, positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI, helping to diversify the AI company's supply chain. The deal highlights the increasingly interconnected corporate economy surrounding AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese brewing giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at all six of its breweries in the country following a disruptive cyberattack. The attack affected the company's ordering and delivery systems, forcing a production halt and causing stock shortages at major retailers. While the breweries are not yet at full capacity, production of the popular Asahi Super Dry beer has resumed, along with some food and soft drink manufacturing. The incident underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks on major corporate operations, affecting supply chains and product availability.</p>

          <p>Turkey, particularly Istanbul, has become a leading international destination for hair transplant procedures, attracting around one million medical tourists in 2022 for this surgery alone. The industry's boom is driven by significantly lower costs compared to the U.S. and Europe, with clinics offering all-inclusive packages that bundle travel and accommodation. While the affordability and social media promotion have normalized the procedure, concerns have been raised about "black market clinics" and unlicensed practitioners, which pose risks of botched results and health complications. The Turkish Health Ministry has acknowledged these issues and pledged stricter oversight.</p>

This growth rate represents a slowdown compared to the 8.7% increase seen in the previous year and is below the 10-year average, reflecting consumer caution amid economic uncertainty. The report anticipates that shoppers will be actively seeking discounts, with mobile devices expected to drive over half of all online sales.

          <p>Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, reported that its vaccination programs saved a record 1.7 million lives in 2024, an increase of 400,000 from the previous year. The efforts resulted in 72 million children being vaccinated, with significant gains in routine immunization coverage against diseases like polio, measles, and pneumonia, even in conflict-affected nations. A major milestone was the rollout of the first routine malaria vaccinations in 17 African countries, a crucial step against a disease that kills hundreds of thousands annually. This progress underscores the profound impact of vaccines on global public health.</p>

          <p>At the party's annual conference, the UK's Conservative party announced a plan to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to young people in their first job to help them save for a home deposit. The "First Job Bonus" proposal would redirect the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions into a savings account. The party also pledged to abolish business rates for many high street shops. These policies would reportedly be funded by a £47 billion annual savings drive, involving cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, in his final season, is drawing parallels to the end of fellow Hall of Famer Greg Maddux's career. Seventeen years ago, a rookie Kershaw and a veteran Maddux were both in the Dodgers' postseason bullpen. Now, as Kershaw concludes his own celebrated career, he has also been moved to a relief role for the playoffs, despite still being an effective pitcher. Team management noted that Kershaw embraced the move, prioritizing the team's chances to win over a starting role, a testament to his professionalism as he nears retirement.</p>

          <p>The animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" has become a surprise cultural phenomenon and Netflix's most-watched movie of all time, with its soundtrack dominating the Billboard charts. The movie follows a K-pop girl group who secretly fight demons with their music, a premise that was initially passed on by its production studio, Sony. Analysts attribute its success to its authentic celebration of K-pop culture, treating it as a global norm rather than an exotic subculture. The film's massive appeal demonstrates the global power and reach of Korean cultural exports.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed a major overhaul of the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and the number of failed sales. Under the new plans, sellers would be legally required to provide key property information upfront, and the introduction of binding contracts could prevent last-minute withdrawals. The government estimates these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten the transaction time by four weeks. The proposals draw inspiration from the Scottish system, which is considered faster and more transparent.</p>
