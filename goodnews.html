          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June but Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:09:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, aligning with market expectations and down from a 29-month high. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has surpassed the Bank of Japan's 2% target, indicating persistent price pressures despite some relief from easing rice costs. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, risks from a depreciating yen and potential U.S. tariffs could complicate the economic outlook. These factors, combined with upcoming elections and slowing GDP growth, create uncertainty for future monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically underfunded their own defense, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview, Merz stated that Europe has heard the message from Washington and is now committed to increasing its defense spending and capabilities. This shift in stance is driven by the threat posed by Russia's war in Ukraine and a desire for greater strategic independence. Merz emphasized a strengthening triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to bolster European security, foreign policy, and economic growth in this new geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:13:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Online gaming giant Roblox is introducing new safety features, including an AI-driven age estimation tool, to better protect its teenage users. The system will require users to submit a selfie video, which artificial intelligence will analyze to estimate their age, aiming to create more age-appropriate experiences and interactions. This development follows public scrutiny over safety on the platform, notably after an incident where a man was accused of kidnapping a child he met through the game. The new measures represent a significant step by the company to address concerns and bolster its safety protocols for younger players.</p>

          <p>During the first round of The Open Championship, professional golfer Jon Rahm audibly expressed his frustration with a spectator after a poor tee shot on the 10th hole. Rahm claimed that someone in the gallery whistled during his backswing, causing a distraction at a critical moment on a difficult hole. Visibly upset, he turned and scolded the crowd, saying the timing was very poor. He later downplayed the incident to the media, acknowledging that his reaction was partly a way to release tension and that his own bad swing was also a factor in the outcome of the shot.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Take-Off and Landing Capability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was recently tested in a mountainous region, showcasing its reconnaissance and situational awareness capabilities. Developed by a state-owned aerospace firm, the drone's design offers significant tactical flexibility, as it does not require a runway for deployment or retrieval. Its intelligent control system also demonstrated autonomous functions like route planning and threat avoidance, key for potential swarm operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he has secured an agreement with Coca-Cola to begin producing its sodas with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. The move is being framed as a victory for both taste and health, aligning with a focus from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has targeted corn syrup. However, public health experts note that from a metabolic standpoint, cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nearly identical and both contribute to health issues. The change appears to be more of a political and marketing maneuver than a significant step toward improving public health.</p>

          <p>Female members of Congress from both parties joined together to play against a team of journalists in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game. The event sets aside partisan divisions to support the Young Survival Coalition, a charity that assists young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million for the cause over the years. Participants and attendees, including survivors who traveled for the game, celebrated the event as a powerful moment of unity for a deeply personal and important cause.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be over 1.5 million years old has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey, where scientists will melt it to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold crucial information about a previously unknown period of the planet's history. Researchers hope the data can help them understand a mysterious shift in Earth's glacial cycles and provide insights into how our climate system responds to high concentrations of greenhouse gases. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of long-term climate change.</p>

          <p>Starting next July, shoppers in the United Kingdom using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services will be subject to stricter affordability checks under new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority. The rules are designed to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt by ensuring they can afford the repayments before credit is approved. This means some shoppers may be denied this form of credit. The move, which brings BNPL services more in line with other forms of lending, will also grant consumers rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, following speculation over photographs showing swollen legs and bruised hands. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the diagnosis came after a comprehensive exam and described the condition as benign. The bruising was attributed to frequent handshaking combined with taking aspirin. A letter from the White House physician confirmed the diagnosis, noting the condition is common in people over 70 and reiterated that the president remains in "excellent health" with no signs of more serious illness.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit sought to hold them personally liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs stemming from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. Shareholders alleged that officials, including Zuckerberg, breached their duties by failing to prevent the misuse of user data and violating a 2012 consent decree with the FTC. The terms of the settlement, announced in a Delaware court before Zuckerberg was expected to testify, were not immediately disclosed.</p>
