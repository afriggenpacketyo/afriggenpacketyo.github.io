          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his strong support for President Trump. Despite facing hostility from fellow Greenlanders, who largely oppose Trump's interest in acquiring the island, Boassen advocates for closer ties between Greenland and the United States, pushing for a security alliance and independence from Denmark. His transformation began with social media posts, leading to connections with Trump advisors and a role in promoting U.S.-Greenland relations. While his efforts are met with skepticism by some, Boassen believes he is contributing to a significant moment in Greenland's history.</p>

The owners, Neil and Krystal King, also face high tariffs on their rubber ducks, which are primarily made in China.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March. A federal judge ordered her release during a hearing where Ozturk and her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated. The Trump administration claimed her student visa was revoked due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas, a claim disputed by Ozturk's supporters.

The oral medication targets the HER2 protein and blocks the activity of the protein‚Äôs tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signalling cell growth.

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amid intense competition and slower consumption. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales overall, but a 4% increase in transactions offset a decline in average spending, indicating efforts to maintain market share. Luckin Coffee is also expanding in smaller cities, which are seeing significant growth in the number of coffee shops. This trend suggests that both companies are adapting to the changing dynamics of China's coffee market by targeting new consumer bases.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Cash-Loving Culture Slows Adoption of App-Based Salary Payments</h2>

          <p>Despite the introduction of app-based digital salary payments in Japan two years ago, the system has struggled to gain widespread acceptance due to the country's strong preference for cash. Only a small percentage of workers currently receive their salaries via mobile payment apps, despite awareness of the option. Experts believe that increased benefits and broader availability, especially for part-time workers, are needed to boost adoption. However, the percentage of cashless payments in Japan is steadily increasing, indicating a gradual shift away from traditional cash transactions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Consumers Embrace Local Brands as a Statement of National Pride</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising trade tensions and global fragmentation, Chinese consumers are increasingly choosing domestic brands as a statement of resilience and national pride. Consumption has evolved beyond practical needs to become an emotional and cultural act, reflecting identity and aspiration. Market data indicates a surge in preference for local brands, especially among younger generations, who view them as markers of cultural identity and creative ambition. This trend underscores China's shift toward a domestically driven consumption economy.</p>

          <h2>Atmospheric River Expected to Bring Heavy Rainfall to Southeast U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 21:23:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An unusual atmospheric river event is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, with some areas expected to receive 4 to 6 inches of rain, and isolated spots potentially reaching 12 inches. The event, originating from a jet stream over the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to impact Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. While atmospheric rivers typically affect the Western U.S., this event is due to a 'cutoff low' diverting the jet stream eastward. The rainfall could alleviate drought conditions in some areas but also poses a risk of flooding.</p>
