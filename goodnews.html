          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen killed in the 1944 crash of the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait" are being laid to rest thanks to a remarkable investigation by family members and a Navy recovery mission. The B-24 bomber, carrying 11 men, was shot down off the coast of New Guinea. A relative of one of the crew members, Scott Althaus, initiated a search that led to the discovery of the wreckage and subsequent recovery of remains, dog tags, and personal items. The airmen are being buried with military honors in their respective hometowns, bringing closure to families who never stopped believing they would return home.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Ottawa for a visit intended to emphasize Canada's sovereignty amid trade tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that the Royal Visit is a reminder of the bond between Canada and the Crown, forged over generations and grounded in common values. The King and Queen met with elected officials and local community members, with the King scheduled to deliver the Speech of the Throne to Parliament, marking the first time a monarch has done so in Canada since 1977. The visit comes amid a trade war with the United States and repeated suggestions from the U.S. President that Canada would be better off as a U.S. state.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working on adjustments for closer Tanner Scott after recent struggles, particularly with leaving pitches in the middle of the strike zone. Despite having good overall stats, Scott has blown several saves due to mistakes that hitters are capitalizing on. The Dodgers coaching staff is encouraging Scott to aim for more "misses" and not be afraid to walk more batters to regain command. With several other high-leverage relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the Dodgers bullpen stability.</p>

          <p>Alexis Roderick, wife of Billy Joel, shared a message of gratitude and optimism following the singer's recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, which affects vision, hearing, and balance, led to the cancellation of Joel's upcoming concerts. Roderick thanked fans for their outpouring of love and support, emphasizing Joel's role as a beloved father and husband. NPH, a condition involving cerebrospinal fluid buildup, is most likely to occur in people over age 65, and treatment typically involves surgery to implant a shunt to drain excess fluid.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard, becoming the first person to accomplish this feat. Pugh undertook the swim to raise awareness about the plight of sharks, aiming to change public perceptions and encourage protections for these animals often maligned by films like "Jaws." He described the swim as one of the toughest of his career due to the cold water, strong winds, and constant awareness of sharks in the water. Pugh hopes his effort will highlight the unsustainable rate at which sharks are being killed and inspire action to protect them.</p>

The project involves students being scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted before entering replica jail cells, complete with stainless-steel toilets, to create a realistic experience. The goal is to initiate tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, and violence, providing students with information to make informed choices. Organizers emphasize that the initiative is not a scare tactic but rather a way to raise awareness about legal responsibilities, given that children as young as 10 can be arrested in the U.K.</p>
