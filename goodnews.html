          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in for a second term as President of Ecuador, vowing to tackle corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime, while also focusing on economic reforms and job creation. Noboa, who first assumed the presidency in November 2023, aims to work with the private sector to foster investment and address high unemployment levels, which contribute to the country's security issues. Despite facing criticism from the opposition, Noboa's National Democratic Action party holds a majority in Congress, crucial for advancing his agenda, including a crime-fighting bill with significant economic implications.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has previously been imprisoned and banned from film-making in his home country, spoke out against the restrictions of the regime after winning the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Panahi picked up the prestigious Palme d'Or for It Was Just an Accident, described by BBC Culture as "a furious but funny revenge thriller that takes aim at oppressive regimes". He was cheered as he urged fellow Iranians to "set aside" differences and problems. "What's most important now is our country and the freedom of our country," he said.</p>
