          <p>Former Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb has agreed to a one-year deal with the Houston Texans, potentially worth up to $5 million. The agreement, contingent on a successful physical, includes a base salary of $2.5 million. Chubb, who suffered a significant knee injury in 2023, aims to revitalize his career with the Texans, joining forces with running back Joe Mixon in Houston's offense. He had previously garnered four consecutive Pro Bowl selections from 2019 to 2022, but his production declined after returning from the injury in the 2024 season.
