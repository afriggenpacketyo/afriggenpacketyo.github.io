This upgrade is part of China's broader effort to digitally transform its coal industry and construct intelligent mines, as outlined in a 2020 government initiative.

The ruling represents a setback for the administration's plans to remake the federal government, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported progress in tariff talks with U.S. officials, aiming for a potential deal as early as next month. After meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Akazawa stated that another round of negotiations is planned before the G7 summit in mid-June. Akazawa emphasized Japan's demand for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports. The discussions involve proposals to increase Japanese investment in the U.S. and cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity. (not investment advice)</p>
