          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock saw a notable jump after former President Donald Trump commented on the company's controversial logo rebranding. Trump suggested the company revert to its old logo, acknowledging customer feedback as a "great opportunity" for free publicity. His remarks, shared on Truth Social, followed his son's earlier criticism and contributed to a more than 5% gain in the company's shares within minutes. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet, featuring a reimagined logo.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has reached a settlement in a class action copyright infringement lawsuit, where authors accused the company of using their copyrighted works to train its AI models without permission. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the case involved allegations of pirating millions of books from online libraries. A previous court ruling partially favored Anthropic, deeming the use "exceedingly transformative" and "fair use," though acknowledging potential piracy. This settlement averts a trial that could have resulted in billions in damages for the Amazon-backed company.</p>

          <p>Identity software maker Okta surpassed Wall Street's fiscal projections, leading to a 7% rise in its shares during extended trading. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed the strong performance to unexpectedly favorable economic conditions, revising earlier cautious macroeconomic guidance. The company reported a 13% year-over-year revenue growth and a significant increase in net income. Okta anticipates further growth from the increasing demand for managing AI agent identities and expanding its integrated software offerings. The company's updated fiscal 2026 forecast no longer reflects economic caution, signaling confidence in its market position and future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman will not face a parliamentary standards investigation over "cash for questions" allegations, after referring himself to the commissioner in June. Claims suggested a company he advised helped him draft parliamentary questions, potentially conflicting with previous advice against lobbying the government. Freeman expressed delight with the decision, calling the claims "unfounded" and stating that the rules permit advocating for sectors of public interest, provided declarations are made. The inquiry concluded there were insufficient grounds for a formal investigation into the former science minister.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against all 15 judges of the Maryland U.S. District Court. The administration had challenged a standing order that prevented federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants contesting their detentions. Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the administration lacked the legal right to sue and that the judges were absolutely immune, criticizing the administration's "confrontational path." The decision upholds judicial independence and suggests that grievances against court orders should be pursued through appeals, not direct lawsuits against the judiciary.</p>
