          <h2>Missouri Judge Reinstates Block on Numerous State Abortion Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 05:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A state judge in Missouri has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, including a near-total ban, a 72-hour waiting period, and various facility requirements. The ruling from a Jackson County judge argues that the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters last year. Planned Parenthood announced it will resume providing procedural abortions in the state, while the Missouri Attorney General's office has stated its intention to appeal the decision. The ruling marks the latest development in a prolonged legal battle over abortion access in Missouri.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut, the dominant champion of competitive eating, is set to return to the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after a one-year suspension. Chestnut, nicknamed "Jaws," was barred from the 2024 event due to a contract dispute involving his promotion of a rival plant-based hot dog brand. His return is highly anticipated by fans and organizers, with the 16-time winner aiming to reclaim his title. The event has become a major spectacle, drawing large crowds and a significant television audience, solidifying its place as a unique American holiday tradition.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic tour in Europe, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that the export of rare earths should not become a source of conflict between China and the European Union. Speaking in Berlin, Wang emphasized that China's export controls on dual-use goods are a sovereign right and align with international norms aimed at maintaining global peace. He assured that the normal needs of European companies for these critical materials will be met, provided they comply with regulations and procedures. Wang suggested that any attempts to hype the issue are driven by hidden agendas.</p>

          <p>A growing number of U.S. cities are replacing traditional Fourth of July fireworks with choreographed drone shows, citing safety and environmental concerns. Cities like Salt Lake City have adopted the high-tech displays to reduce wildfire risks in drought conditions and to offer a quieter, more inclusive celebration for those with PTSD and for pets. While drone shows, which involve hundreds of synchronized, illuminated drones creating images in the sky, are gaining popularity, they are not without risks, and some communities are reverting to fireworks after public pushback. The industry is experiencing rapid growth, with demand currently outstripping the supply of available drone fleets.</p>

Palmeiras's manager sees it as a prime opportunity for Estevao to showcase his potential, while Chelsea's manager is focused solely on winning the game against the Brazilian side.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is a significant beneficiary of President Trump's massive tax and spending package, potentially receiving a 30% funding increase to nearly $40 billion in 2026. A substantial portion of these funds, around $25 billion, is earmarked for an initial investment in the "Golden Dome" multi-layered missile defense system. This financial boost provides a beacon of hope for defense and space contractors, offering a long-term, large-scale project amid budget cuts at NASA. The funding aligns with the administration's goal of achieving "space superiority," particularly in response to China's growing military space capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a Chinese state media editorial calling for tighter regulation of "blind box" toys for children, analysts believe Pop Mart International, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain a hot consumer brand. The company's stock, which saw a brief dip, has largely recovered, as its primary demographic consists of young adults, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapid international expansion, with overseas sales growing significantly, provides a cushion against potential domestic regulatory impacts. The brand's success is attributed to the "affordable exclusivity" and excitement that the mystery box model provides to collectors.</p>
