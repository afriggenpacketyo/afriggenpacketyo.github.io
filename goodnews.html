          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 09:31:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is modifying planned welfare reforms, including disability benefit cuts, in response to potential rebellions from Labour MPs. The changes aim to soften the impact of cuts worth 춲5 billion annually by 2030. Individuals losing Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will receive it for a 13-week transitional period instead of four, and carer's allowance will continue during this time. Recipients with the most severe conditions will not be reassessed and will receive extra income support, while a scheme allowing disabled individuals to try employment without risking benefits will be introduced. The welfare package as a whole could push an extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, into relative poverty, according to the government's impact assessment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling elections in the U.S. The order sought to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. A group of Democratic state attorneys general challenged the order as unconstitutional, arguing that it usurped the states' constitutional power and sought to amend election law by fiat. The White House defended the order as promoting free, fair, and honest elections, calling proof of citizenship a commonsense requirement.</p>

          <p>England has recalled left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone for their five-match T20 series against India. Ecclestone, who had been taking a break from domestic cricket to prioritize her wellbeing and recover from a quad injury, is expected to return for the first game against India on June 28. She missed England's T20 and ODI series wins over West Indies due to a knee injury sustained at the Women's Premier League in India. This series will be Ecclestone's first time representing England since January's Ashes defeat in Australia.</p>

          <p>Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright reports that the company has reduced its hiring time by 75% using an AI hiring platform called Ava Cado. Ava Cado, developed by Paradox, assists with chatting with candidates, answering questions about Chipotle, collecting basic information, scheduling interviews, and sending offers. This efficiency is expected to help Chipotle open over 300 new locations this year. Boatwright emphasizes that the AI is intended to enhance the team member experience by removing waste, not to replace human interaction.</p>
