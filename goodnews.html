          <h2>Wayne Rooney Criticizes Tom Brady's "Unfair" Comments on Coaching Work Ethic</h2>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney expressed strong disappointment over Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments regarding his work ethic as Birmingham City's head coach. Rooney, who was sacked after 83 days, argued that Brady, a minority owner, misunderstood the nuances of football management, which differ significantly from the NFL's shorter season, emphasizing the necessity of player rest. He defended his tenure by highlighting the club's pre-existing organizational challenges and the subsequent struggles faced by other managers. Despite the public criticism, Rooney maintains respect for Brady's athletic achievements and acknowledges Birmingham's current positive trajectory, attributing it to necessary player changes and substantial investment.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion. This transaction marks the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, with Chisholm acquiring at least 51% ownership and full control anticipated by 2028, potentially valuing the franchise at $7.3 billion. The new ownership group includes existing shareholder Rob Hale and Bruce Beal Jr., succeeding Wyc Grousbeck's group, which purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million and guided them to two NBA championships. This sale reflects the increasing valuation of major sports franchises. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal dispute, ruling that Pinkfong's globally popular "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize US composer Jonathan Wright's work. The court upheld lower court verdicts, determining that Wright's 2011 recording of the children's folk song "had not reached a level of substantial alteration" from the public domain original to qualify for separate copyright protection. Pinkfong's 2016 version became a massive viral sensation, accumulating billions of views on YouTube and inspiring numerous adaptations. Wright initiated the lawsuit after Pinkfong threatened legal action against a political party for using their song, prompting him to re-evaluate his own copyright claims on the tune.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of BTec qualifications in the UK, practical courses equivalent to GCSEs (Level 2) or A-levels (Level 3), which are assessed through a mix of exams, coursework, and projects. BTecs serve as significant pathways for students entering university, with one in four opting for this route, or directly into employment, covering popular subjects like health and social care. Graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, their future was recently debated due to government plans to streamline post-16 education. However, the Labour government has since decided to retain funding for 157 "key courses," ensuring the continued availability of these vocational routes alongside T-levels.</p>

          <p>Voltify, a startup co-founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, is striving to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. rail industry within a decade by transitioning from diesel to rechargeable batteries. Their "VoltCars," essentially sodium-ion batteries on wheels, are designed to integrate with existing freight locomotives, potentially yielding $94 billion in savings over two decades. Despite initial industry skepticism concerning charging time and reliability, Voltify has developed an algorithm to predict energy demands and is constructing solar-powered microgrids. The company is actively engaged in discussions with major railroad firms and plans pilot projects for early 2026, contributing to the growing trend of battery-powered rail solutions.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 01:01:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent TravelPerk survey indicates a growing trend of "bleisure" travel, with 55% of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing loved ones on work trips. This phenomenon is driven by a desire to reclaim family time, particularly for parents, and to achieve substantial cost savings by combining business expenses with personal leisure. Although widely accepted, many employees prefer not to openly disclose these arrangements due to professionalism concerns. However, some companies are encouraging this practice, provided business objectives are met and expenses are clearly delineated. This blended travel market is projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

          <p>Anchorage, Alaska, is experiencing a blend of anticipation and apprehension as it prepares to host the Trump-Putin summit. Residents, who identify strongly with their independent Alaskan identity, are wary of the meeting's potential outcomes, particularly given the state's historical ties to Russia. While some appreciate the city's heightened profile, others express pessimism, fearing negative repercussions from the discussions. The satirical plea, "Please don't sell us back," underscores local anxieties about the summit's implications. Despite cultural connections, Alaskans generally view Putin with distrust and are somewhat disappointed that the meeting will occur on a military base, away from public engagement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans consuming alcohol has dropped to a record low of 54%, largely driven by increased public awareness of its health risks, even in moderation. Experts link this decline to a growing understanding that any alcohol intake can heighten risks of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Young adults, aged 18-34, exhibit lower drinking rates and a stronger belief in alcohol's harm. Societal shifts, including the rising popularity of sobriety movements, non-alcoholic beverages, fewer in-person social gatherings, and the cost of alcohol, also contribute to this significant change in drinking habits.</p>

While specific details are forthcoming, initial reports indicate funding for two data centers, climate change resilience initiatives, and security enhancements. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles underscored the "shared destiny" and mutual commitment between the two nations. This agreement builds upon similar security pacts Australia has recently forged with other Pacific island countries.</p>
