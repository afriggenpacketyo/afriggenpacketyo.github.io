          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, he created websites to document miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His path to sainthood was fast-tracked after the Vatican attributed two miracles to him, a move seen as an effort to inspire faith in younger generations. Pilgrims are visiting sites associated with his life, including his baptismal church in London, ahead of the ceremony.</p>

          <p>After nearly four decades, Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, prompting questions about the magazine's future relevance in a fast-paced digital world. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with popular culture, famously putting celebrities like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits the challenge of keeping the iconic print publication influential amidst competition from social media and changing cultural tastes. The transition marks a pivotal moment for both Vogue and the broader fashion industry.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) starting October 12, which will change how non-EU citizens, including those from the UK, cross into the 29-country Schengen Area. The system will replace manual passport stamping with a digital process that includes scanning passports and collecting biometric data like fingerprints and facial photos. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, there are concerns that the initial registration process could cause significant delays at major border crossings like Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson led Somerset to a dramatic quarter-final victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast cricket tournament, securing their place at finals day. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four to win the match with just one ball to spare. He finished with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls, capping a remarkable comeback after Somerset's chances had looked slim. The Bears had set a strong target of 190-6, but Dickson's stunning late-game performance ultimately denied them a semi-final spot.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, defeated Australia 47-7 to secure their 30th consecutive victory and a place in the tournament's quarter-finals. Despite the comfortable 40-point margin, the performance was not flawless, as Australia's intensity unsettled England in the first half. England's powerful driving maul, usually a reliable weapon, was initially inconsistent before finding its rhythm. The team will now face Scotland in the knockout stage, with tougher opponents like France or New Zealand potentially looming in later rounds.</p>

          <p>The recent regular-season game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is part of the NFL's broader strategy for sustained global growth. The league aims to move beyond one-off events and build year-round fan engagement in international markets, with games also planned for Europe and Australia. The sell-out crowd of nearly 50,000 in Brazil demonstrates strong interest, which the NFL hopes to cultivate through media deals and team-led events. The long-term goal is to establish American football as a major global sport property.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix with the fastest lap in Formula 1 history, surpassing a 2020 record set by Lewis Hamilton. His average speed of 164.466mph was achieved due to a combination of the current cars' low-drag design and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track at Monza. The previous record was held by cars from a different regulatory era, generally considered to be faster overall. Verstappen expressed optimism about his chances in the race, despite the McLaren car's typical strength over longer distances.</p>

Officials are urging the public to "keep their cool," emphasizing that it is only a test to help ensure public safety in a real emergency.</p>
