          <p>Rice prices in Japan have surged, more than doubling in May and marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar rises in previous months. This spike occurs as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations. The Bank of Japan held rates steady at 0.5% but indicated potential future rate hikes if underlying inflation approaches their 2% target. However, the bank also forecasts a potential slowdown in inflation due to a decelerating economy, while geopolitical tensions could impact energy prices (not investment advice).</p>
