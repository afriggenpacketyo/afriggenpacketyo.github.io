          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, was released after nearly five months in ICE custody. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon, despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having a pending green card application. Her attorneys condemned ICE's actions, which included alleged attempts to deport her in violation of a court order, framing her case as an example of harsh and unjust immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Vietnam have reached a new trade agreement that sets a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, averting a potential 46% levy under President Trump's previously announced plan. In return, the deal reportedly gives the U.S. tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets and imposes a 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam to curb circumvention by China. The agreement provides some stability for companies manufacturing in Vietnam, though the new tariff still represents a significant cost. (not investment advice)</p>

He cited the new U.S.-Vietnam trade deal as a positive factor for apparel and furniture companies with manufacturing in the region. Additionally, Cramer suggested that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is beneficial for U.S.-based consumer packaged goods companies, as it makes their exports more competitive on the global stage.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's proclamation that aimed to ban most migrants from seeking asylum at the southern border. The judge ruled that the president overstepped his authority by attempting to bypass the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides a legal process for asylum applications. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration policies, though it has been temporarily stayed for two weeks to allow the government time to appeal.</p>
