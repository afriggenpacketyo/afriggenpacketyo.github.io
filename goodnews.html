          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits, titled "John's Version," after regaining the rights to his song catalog. For decades, Fogerty had lost control over his own music following the band's breakup, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his classic songs for a period. Encouraged by his wife Julie and supported by his sons who play in his band, the project represents a personal and professional victory. The article explores his journey of reclaiming his musical legacy and the family effort behind the new recordings.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a student reflects on their decision to reject an admission offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author explains that the choice was driven by a conviction that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from promoting intellectual rigor to enforcing ideological conformity. While acknowledging the loss of prestige and networking opportunities, the writer argues that their chosen path offers a deeper formation of character and soul. The article contends that the Bible college provides a more authentic intellectual challenge by focusing on eternal questions and fostering an environment where faith can be genuinely explored.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," investigates the complexities of chronic pain, which affects millions of Americans. The article highlights the story of a heavy metal musician who suffered from a rare and excruciating condition for decades until a revolutionary treatment involving deep brain stimulation provided relief. Research now suggests that the brain is often the source of chronic pain, memorizing and replaying pain signals even after an initial injury has healed. This new understanding is paving the way for innovative therapies that can predict and interrupt pain signals before they are consciously felt.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, celebrated for his distinctive figurative art over a seven-decade career, is now focusing on promoting the work of other artists. At 98, Katz has gifted a collection of over 100 paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine for an exhibition titled "Painting Energy." The collection features pieces by both emerging and established artists whose work Katz admires for its vitality and impact. This act of philanthropy is rooted in his desire to support artists who face the same struggles he did early in his career, emphasizing his belief in giving back to the artistic community.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Foster Connection and Cooperation with Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building genuine, long-term cooperation with children relies on making them feel emotionally safe and connected. Instead of focusing on immediate obedience, parents can use specific phrases that validate a child's feelings and calm their nervous system. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" can defuse shame and prevent power struggles by turning parents into allies rather than adversaries. The article argues that when children feel heard and respected, their natural inclination is to listen and cooperate with their parents.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the British defence industry, which was chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of rebuilding her life after her husband died suddenly when she was 26. Initially believing she would never remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, whom she eventually married. Morin explains that her relationship with Hasty not only provided companionship but also encouraged her to dream bigger and reinvent herself. His support was instrumental in her transition from a traditional therapy practice to a successful career as a full-time author and speaker, and their decision to live on a sailboat in the Florida Keys, a life she had never previously imagined.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White shares his experience playing Bruce Springsteen in the film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." White describes the daunting task of portraying the iconic musician, particularly during a time when Springsteen was battling depression and feeling fraudulent as a person despite his professional success. The actor drew parallels between Springsteen's internal struggles and his own Emmy-winning role as chef Carmy in "The Bear," noting both characters carry significant emotional baggage. With Springsteen's direct involvement and approval, the film offers an intimate look at a pivotal, vulnerable moment in the rock legend's life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines for specific high-risk populations, including adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain underlying medical conditions. While officials state that anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower approval may limit access for some who were previously eligible. Conditions that qualify include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy. The new framework could create confusion and access issues, particularly as some pharmacies in certain states may not administer vaccines that are not broadly recommended by the CDC's advisory committee.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, commemorates the 140th anniversary of three Hawaiian princes introducing surfing to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, teenage royals David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were attending a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of what was then a royal Hawaiian sport captivated locals and planted the seeds for surfing culture in America. The exhibition aims to shed light on these little-known origins of a now globally popular sport.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the moral and psychological dilemma of feeling happy while being aware of widespread global suffering. The author references ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is natural to feel the pain of others. However, these same traditions also advocate for experiencing "sympathetic joy," or the happiness of others. The article argues against falling into either saccharine positivity or cynical despair, proposing instead that we allow ourselves to feel the full spectrum of emotions. Acknowledging both the world's horrors and its delights is presented as a form of resistance and self-care.</p>
