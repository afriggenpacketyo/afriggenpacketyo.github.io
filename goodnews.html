          <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced that Southeast Asian nations aim to present a united front when discussing U.S. tariffs with President Donald Trump. ASEAN seeks a unified approach to address economic challenges stemming from U.S. tariffs and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar, aiming to preserve regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Anwar emphasized the importance of an open, inclusive, and rules-based international order, which he believes is threatened by arbitrary actions. The region relies heavily on exports to the U.S. and has been negatively impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs, which vary from 10% to 49% across ASEAN member states. Optimism regarding potential future cooperation is expressed with China and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which could potentially help insulate ASEAN's economy.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to lower soaring prices, aiming for a retail price of approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move follows criticism of the government's prior ineffectiveness in controlling rice prices amid rising inflation and household budget pressures. The government intends to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency to address public concerns and plans for online sales to broaden distribution are also under consideration. (not investment advice)</p>
