          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception. There are concerns that these medicines may harm unborn babies and reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, due to side effects such as vomiting and slowed stomach emptying. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking these GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward, recommending alternative methods like coils or implants for those on oral contraceptives. The warning comes amid growing concerns that many women are using these drugs unsafely without proper medical advice.</p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first home-grown 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, signaling a significant milestone for the country's aviation ambitions. The move comes shortly after the U.S. announced new export restrictions targeting China, including technologies related to jet engines. While the AES100 differs from jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts view its development as a major step forward for the country's aviation sector. The engine was produced by the state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC).</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas before European explorers arrived, challenging the long-held belief that it was solely introduced by settlers. Researchers discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria responsible for leprosy, was present in the Americas 1,000 years before European contact. The findings indicate that this bacterium had already spread throughout North and South America. The study, which involved analyzing DNA samples from ancient human remains, changes the understanding of the disease's history in the region.</p>

          <p>With forecasts predicting an above-normal hurricane season, experts advise homeowners to review their insurance policies. It's crucial to ensure adequate coverage limits to rebuild a home, understand deductibles, and assess the need for flood insurance. Experts recommend checking policy limits against current construction costs and being aware of wind deductibles, which can be substantial. Given that standard homeowners' policies typically don't cover floods, a separate flood insurance policy is highly recommended, regardless of location.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Trump to address trade disputes and the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Support for Ukraine and NATO spending will also be key discussion points, with Merz seeking to reassure the U.S. of Germany's commitment to defense spending and European security. The meeting is critical given the tensions between the U.S. and the EU during Trump's previous terms.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that about 98 percent of Indianapolis is sinking at a rate of about 2 millimeters a year, likely due to the aftermath of the last ice age. The weight of the glacier compressed the bedrock, and now the earth is trying to recalibrate as the compressed areas rise and uplifted regions sink. While the uniform sinking poses a low risk for infrastructure damage, it could alter drainage patterns and increase flood risk over time, requiring adaptive stormwater management policies.</p>

          <p>The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced that the country's inflation rate for April was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to a car tax data calculation error. The ONS initially reported an annual rate of 3.5%, but revised data shows the consumer price index rose by 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The error stemmed from incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport.
