        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia is investing $1.1 billion to develop and deploy a fleet of large, autonomous underwater attack drones known as "Ghost Sharks." The stealthy, long-range vehicles are being built by Anduril Australia, with the first delivery to the navy expected by next January. Defense Minister Richard Marles stated the program will significantly enhance Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing the future nuclear-powered submarines acquired through the AUKUS partnership. The drones are designed for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, reflecting Australia's strategy to counter potential strategic threats in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 2%, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely stemming from U.S. tariff policies. Despite euro zone inflation hovering near the bank's 2% target, officials remain cautious about the potential impact of trade disputes on growth, investment, and consumption. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while recent trade agreements have reduced some risks, the overall outlook remains unsettled. The central bank emphasized a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, offering little guidance on future rate cuts and signaling an end to the recent easing cycle for now.

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for savings accounts, highlighting the significant difference between traditional accounts and high-yield options. As of September 2025, the national average savings rate is a low 0.39%, while top high-yield savings accounts offer rates between 4.15% and 4.35%. The report advises consumers to consider online banks, which often provide higher rates due to lower overhead costs and typically have low or no minimum balance requirements. To maximize earnings and build a robust emergency fund, consumers are encouraged to compare different high-yield accounts to find the best combination of high rates and low fees.

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps. This policy change comes after the U.S. cut humanitarian aid, which was the primary source of food for the camps, leading to fears of a life-threatening situation and rising malnutrition. The move is seen as a pragmatic solution to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and is also expected to help fill labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a potential regional benchmark for a rights-based approach to refugee solutions.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the average mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates as of September 10, 2025, amidst a challenging housing market. Current national averages show a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.58% and a 15-year loan at 5.76%, with refinance rates slightly higher. The report advises prospective borrowers on how to secure better rates, emphasizing the importance of a strong credit score, typically in the mid-to-high 700s. It also suggests that borrowers shop around with different lenders and consider shorter loan terms to obtain more favorable interest rates and lower long-term costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that family offices, the investment firms for ultra-wealthy families, are shifting their portfolio strategies by increasing allocations to public stocks and reducing exposure to private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity investments fell from 26% to 21% over the past two years. This move towards more liquid assets comes despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation. The survey also indicates that public equities and ETFs are the preferred vehicles for investing in the artificial intelligence boom, reflecting a broader trend of opportunistic investing in public markets.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans and credit cards. As of September 10, 2025, the average rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.37%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. The article explains the difference between the two products: fixed-rate, lump-sum home equity loans versus variable-rate, revolving HELOCs. It advises homeowners to shop around for the best terms, as rates can vary, and to be mindful that their home serves as collateral for the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liu Jun, a prominent mathematician from Harvard University, has clarified that his decision to leave the U.S. and return to China was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest or professional dissatisfaction. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu stated his choice "has nothing to do with Trump." He explained that his move was primarily motivated by a desire to be with family and his lifelong connection to the Tsinghua University campus in Beijing, where he was born. His departure had previously fueled speculation about a potential brain drain from the U.S. amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry expressed his disbelief regarding allegations that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer circumvented the NBA's salary cap. The league is investigating a report that a company in which Ballmer invested made a $28 million sponsorship deal with Clippers star Kawhi Leonard in 2021 as an indirect payment. Lasry, who has known Ballmer for a long time, described him as honorable and stated he doesn't believe there was an attempt to skirt the rules. He characterized the situation as likely being "a lot of smoke" without substance, emphasizing that NBA owners are well aware of the severe consequences for such violations.</p>
