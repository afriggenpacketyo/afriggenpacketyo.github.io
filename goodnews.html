          <p>United Launch Alliance delayed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine, with only 30 minutes remaining in the countdown. ULA CEO Tory Bruno announced the scrub on Bluesky, stating the issue with a GN2 purge line couldn't be resolved within the count, necessitating a temporary halt. The launch from Florida's Space Coast was initially scheduled for the previous Friday but was rescheduled to Monday due to inclement weather. A new launch date will be announced later after the issue is sorted out. Optimism is tempered by the technical setback, but the project's overall goals remain intact.</p>

          <p>AMD shares rose by 10% after Piper Sandler analysts increased their price target, anticipating a "snapback" for the chipmaker's GPUs in the fourth quarter.

The unveiling of AMD's next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack, has generated enthusiasm.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 could yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, influenced by factors like gender, interest rates, and annuity structure. Women typically receive lower payments due to longer life expectancy, while higher interest rates lead to more attractive payouts. Annuity types, such as single life or joint life, and optional features like cost-of-living adjustments also affect monthly income. While annuities provide guaranteed income and financial security, they lack liquidity and potential for higher investment returns (not investment advice).</p>
