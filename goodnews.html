          <p>Indiana Fever guard Kelsey Mitchell revealed she suffered from rhabdomyolysis, a serious medical condition, during a WNBA playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces. Mitchell described experiencing a terrifying "sense of numbness" where she briefly lost movement in her lower body, causing her to panic on the court. She was assisted by staff and taken to a hospital for what was initially reported as severe cramping. Mitchell has been a key player for the Fever, especially with other stars sidelined by injuries throughout the season.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat who has won two elections in a state that consistently votes for Donald Trump, is being discussed as a potential presidential candidate. In an interview with NPR, Beshear outlined his belief that Democrats can regain support in rural and red-state areas by focusing on common ground issues and showing respect to all voters. He cited his veto of a bill restricting care for transgender youth as an example of doing the right thing despite political risks. Beshear argues that with the right approach, the Democratic party can expand its electoral map.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a severe housing crisis, Boston City Councilor Henry Santana is advocating for changes to the city's "outdated" zoning laws to facilitate the construction of more triple-decker homes. These three-family buildings were historically a key source of affordable housing for working families but are now difficult to build due to restrictions on building height. Santana's proposal aims to simplify the process, which currently requires expensive and lengthy zoning variances. Housing advocates support the idea, noting that increasing the housing supply is a critical strategy for improving affordability across the region.</p>

          <h2>Culinary Debate Explores the Persistence of Subpar Pasta Shapes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural article delves into the debate over why certain pasta shapes, such as farfalle (bow ties) and penne, continue to be popular despite their functional flaws. Culinary experts argue that good pasta shapes excel at cooking evenly and holding sauce, qualities where shapes like farfalle, with its dense central knot, often fail. The persistence of these "bad" shapes is attributed to nostalgia and their common use in potluck dishes like pasta salad. While some chefs passionately dislike certain shapes, others argue that even a maligned pasta can find its purpose in the right dish, suggesting a matter of perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco's chief executive, Ken Murphy, has publicly warned the UK government against levying additional taxes on the retail industry in the upcoming budget. He stated that retailers have already absorbed substantial new operating costs this year, including higher National Insurance contributions and new recycling levies, declaring "enough is enough." His comments were made as the supermarket giant simultaneously upgraded its own annual profit forecast, attributing the positive outlook to increased sales volume despite price cuts. The Unite union criticized the company for profiting from the cost of living crisis while asking for tax relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed the lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had sued the band for child sexual exploitation, but the judge ruled that the image does not constitute sexually explicit conduct. In the ruling, the judge noted that the context of the photo does not suggest lascivious content and likened it to a family photo of a child bathing. This was Elden's second attempt to sue after a previous case was dismissed for being filed after the statute of limitations had expired.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has transferred a portion of Hacienda Napoles, the infamous former estate of drug lord Pablo Escobar, to women affected by the country's long-running armed conflict. President Gustavo Petro announced that 297 acres of the lavish property, known for its exotic animals including a large hippo population, will be given to local women farmers. After Escobar's death in 1993, the estate was converted into a theme park, but this move is part of a broader land reform program. The transfer aims to address land ownership inequality, a key driver of Colombia's decades-long conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, has declared a race a "heat hazard" ahead of this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix. This designation was triggered by predictions of temperatures exceeding 31°C combined with high humidity. Under the new rule, teams are now required to fit their cars with a driver cooling vest system to mitigate the risk of heat-related health issues. While using the vests is not mandatory for drivers, the system must be installed to ensure no weight advantage is gained by those who opt out of wearing one.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently released state report cards from the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce show significant disparities in the performance of Franklin County's 64 charter schools. Two schools, Franklin Learning Academy and Focus Learning Academy of Central Columbus, achieved the highest possible five-star rating, while three others received the lowest one-star rating. The ratings are based on six categories, including achievement, progress, and graduation rates. Education analysts noted that urban charter schools often perform well on the "progress" metric, which measures student growth over time, and urged parents to use the report cards as a tool.</p>

          <p>Officials and residents in Portland, Oregon, are pushing back against President Trump's characterization of the city as "war-ravaged" and his plan to deploy the National Guard. Governor Tina Kotek and other local leaders have flooded social media with images of peaceful farmers markets and parks to counter the narrative. While acknowledging issues like homelessness, residents express bafflement at the president's description, suggesting he is confusing current peaceful protests with the more intense riots of 2020. The rhetorical battle highlights a stark contrast between the administration's portrayal of urban unrest and the daily reality experienced by many in the city.</p>
