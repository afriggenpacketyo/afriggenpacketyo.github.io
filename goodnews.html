          <h2>Sony Shares Experience Volatile Trading Following Share Buyback Announcement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading after the company announced a 250 billion yen share buyback and reported operating income that exceeded analyst estimates. The operating income for the last three months of the financial year was 203.6 billion yen, surpassing the LSEG estimate of 192.2 billion yen, though it decreased by 11% from the previous year. Sony also shared details regarding a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was lackluster, forecasting a slight increase in operating profit, with a potential hit from US trade policies, though this may change due to a recent US-China trade deal.

          <p>Family offices, which manage wealth for the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth and are expected to manage $5.4 trillion in assets by 2030. However, these offices face significant challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified money managers, with a potential shortage of advisors looming. Trust is a critical factor in hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and family offices must compete with banks and private equity firms for top talent. Young employees are sometimes reluctant to work in family offices due to the lack of clear corporate structure and career progression, and European family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially leading to their release after over three decades for killing their parents in 1989. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited their rehabilitation in prison and letters from corrections officials as factors in his decision. The brothers apologized for their crimes during the hearing, expressing remorse for their actions. While the judge's decision makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final determination rests with Gov. Gavin Newsom and state parole-board officials, who are scheduled to appear before the board on June 13.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal, presented by Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, to American special envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. This plan aims to create a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would involve on-the-ground presence of representatives from other countries, providing extra oversight. While the U.S. has denied the proposal, Iranian media outlets have reported on the new plan, raising questions about its feasibility.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first drop in months, but still remain near historic highs. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs fell to $5.12, after reaching a record $6.23 in March, with the overall average price of eggs declining by 12.7%. This decline is attributed to reduced consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks at commercial poultry operations. Despite this decrease, retail egg prices are still significantly higher than the previous year, due to the ongoing impact of bird flu wiping out flocks of egg-laying hens.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Sky News that Canadians "weren't impressed" by the UK government's decision to offer Donald Trump a second state visit, viewing it as undermining Canadian sovereignty. Carney noted that the invitation clashed with Canada's efforts to assert its sovereignty against U.S. threats. He also mentioned inviting the King to open Canada's parliament as a symbol of sovereignty. Since then, tensions between the two countries have abated, and further negotiations on trade and security are expected soon.</p>
