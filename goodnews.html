          <p>Dutch semiconductor giant ASML aimed to reassure investors about its 2026 growth outlook, even as it forecasted a significant sales decline in China for the upcoming year. The company stated that 2026 total net sales would not be below 2025 levels and plans to offer more detailed guidance in January. While the firm benefits from the ongoing AI boom, with substantial third-quarter orders, it continues to navigate tightening U.S. chip export restrictions impacting its China business. Analysts generally hold a positive view, anticipating growth driven by AI chip foundries and increased global semiconductor manufacturing, despite some market volatility. The firm's recent partnership with a French AI company also highlights its strategic moves in the evolving tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Watchdog Urges Vets to Publish Price Lists for Transparency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 03:20:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has recommended that veterinary practices be mandated to publish their prices. This initiative aims to provide pet owners with upfront cost information, enabling them to shop around for better deals, following an investigation into soaring vet costs. The CMA found that vet prices have risen at nearly double the inflation rate over seven years, and that practices owned by large groups charge significantly more than independent ones. Proposed measures include revealing group ownership, capping prescription fees, and banning bonuses for specific treatments, addressing concerns that pet owners are often kept in the dark about potential expenses, as illustrated by a £12,000 unexpected bill for one dog's surgery.</p>

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin has announced his retirement from the sport at 28, citing a loss of motivation after the last summer's Olympic Games. Despite a successful career including four Olympic medals and 19 international accolades, Carlin felt unable to "ignite that spark again" following a severe crash in his final Olympic event and a subsequent period of recovery and travel. He expressed feeling "daunted but excited" by the decision, concluding his "whirlwind 10 years" content with his achievements. Carlin, now exploring new identities beyond "Jack the cyclist," has rediscovered a love for golf and is considering future career paths outside professional sport.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has proven relentless in the postseason, notably with significant contributions from the bottom half of their batting order. In Game 2 of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, players batting sixth through ninth combined for seven hits, three runs, and three RBIs, securing a 5-1 victory and a 2-0 series lead. This trend has been consistent throughout the postseason, where these lower-order hitters boast a .302 batting average, outperforming the top five. The article highlights the team's depth and collective trust, emphasizing that every player is expected to perform and put pressure on opposing pitchers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected Alex Jones' appeal, upholding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued against being found liable without a trial on the merits of the allegations from victims' families. The justices' decision, made without requiring a response from the families, was welcomed by their lawyer as a proper rejection of Jones' "desperate attempt to avoid accountability." Jones, who filed for bankruptcy, continues to appeal a separate $49 million judgment in Texas and faces ongoing efforts to liquidate his Infowars assets to satisfy the verdicts.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI Announces ChatGPT Will Soon Permit Erotica for Verified Adult Users</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 01:24:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy shift, stating that adult ChatGPT users will soon have access to a less censored version of the AI chatbot, including "erotica for verified adults" by December. This move contrasts with previous restrictive policies aimed at protecting users from mental health risks, which Altman admitted made the chatbot "less useful" for many. The change follows the rollout of new safety features and parental controls, enabling OpenAI to relax restrictions for adults. Additionally, a new ChatGPT version is expected to launch soon, allowing the chatbot to adopt more distinct personalities, building on GPT-4o updates.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly expressed his strong disapproval of a Time magazine cover photo featuring him, calling it "the Worst of All Time" and "super bad." Despite the accompanying article being a "relatively good story" about his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire, Trump criticized the photo's angle for making his hair "disappear" and creating a "floating crown" effect. This reaction highlights Trump's long-standing obsession with his image and appearances on Time's cover. The article notes that even Russia's foreign ministry director defended Trump's appearance, while a picture editor suggested the photo aimed for a sense of grandeur but was aesthetically unflattering for the subject.</p>
