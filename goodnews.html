          <p>Chinese defence firms displayed the potential uses of artificial intelligence in military operations at the China (Beijing) Military Intelligent Technology Expo. Vendors demonstrated how AI could enhance combat decision-making, improve daily training, and assist in intelligence gathering and physical training. EverReach AI, a Beijing-based start-up, presented an AI-assisted military training model featuring a flight map near the Taiwan Strait, suggesting its possible use in refining drills around Taiwan. The system learns from flight training sessions, including weather conditions and pilot habits, to recommend actions, also offering an 'intelligent assistant' for military commanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The rate cuts followed reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders, protecting their net interest margin. Economists anticipate further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate reductions by year-end, as the offshore yuan has strengthened against the dollar due to trade de-escalation and Beijing's preference for currency stability.

          <p>The UK and EU have reached a deal aimed at improving trading ties, but it underscores the continued complexities of their relationship post-Brexit. The agreement seeks to reduce trade frictions, though many details regarding timeframes and costs remain to be negotiated. Some Brexiteers are concerned about the acceptance of 'dynamic alignment' with EU rules, which they see as a compromise of sovereignty. Despite the government's claims of a 'reset,' the ongoing negotiations will determine the real-world impact of the deal, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and mutual recognition of professional qualifications, showing that the uneasy relationship between the UK and its neighbors continues.</p>

          <p>The Woods, a West Hollywood cannabis dispensary co-owned by Woody Harrelson and Bill Maher, was burglarized early Saturday morning.

The dispensary features a cannabis consumption lounge, a bar with cannabis-infused drinks, and a Ganja Giggle Garden, and the incident occurred shortly after a suspected attempted burglary at another dispensary co-founded by the same individuals.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a revenue drop in 2024, CATL's net profit increased, driven by growing demand for electric vehicles in China, as the company's global push has coincided with expansions from leading Chinese EV makers such as BYD.

The wind farm, being built by Equinor, is expected to power 500,000 New York homes, as the Trump administration's initial halt had stunned observers and jeopardized the project's completion, and New York already has one offshore wind farm in operation.</p>
