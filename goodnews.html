          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his performance as "useless" after qualifying 12th for the Hungarian Grand Prix, a position he also finished in. Despite his struggles and a challenging start to his career with Ferrari, Hamilton reaffirmed his commitment to the sport and his team. Team principal Frederic Vasseur and former boss Toto Wolff both expressed confidence in Hamilton, attributing his emotional response to his high standards and predicting he will bounce back. The article notes that while the Ferrari car is improving, Hamilton is still adapting to its characteristics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utility companies like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable state rules that streamline the approval process for solar projects and the increasing economic advantage of solar over natural gas. The boom is occurring despite the state's official removal of climate change from its policy considerations. However, analysts warn that the rollback of federal tax credits and emerging grid constraints could pose future challenges to this momentum.</p>

The move is a response to the increasing use of online platforms by criminal gangs to promote dangerous crossings of the English Channel. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the "immoral" practice of selling false promises for profit. This proposal is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to address the "small boats" crisis and combat organized immigration crime.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals will be available in "early September." This fund was established as part of President Trump's recently passed legislative package to help offset the impact of significant cuts to Medicaid. Oz stated the money is intended to assist with workforce development, system right-sizing, and the adoption of technology like telehealth. The fund aims to stabilize rural healthcare facilities facing financial pressure from the new Medicaid restrictions.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for elected office for the first time, citing their departures as a protest against the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, running in various state and federal races, are openly criticizing recent DOJ decisions, such as the purge of the public integrity division and the reduction of civil rights enforcement. Lacking traditional political backgrounds, they are campaigning on their experience as public servants and their desire to protect the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were mis-sold car finance due to hidden commissions paid to dealers. Following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed extremely high commissions unfair, the FCA will consult on a plan that could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. Payouts to individual victims are expected to be less than £950 per deal, with the first payments anticipated next year. The regulator advised consumers to complain directly to their lender rather than using claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

According to Russia's volcanology institute, this is the first historically confirmed eruption of this specific volcano in 600 years.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to properly reflect all U.S. presidential impeachment proceedings. The statement followed a report that a temporary placard referencing President Trump's two impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard's poor quality and placement, not due to any political pressure. The museum now plans to create a permanent and more consistent update to the exhibit in the coming weeks.</p>

Norris acknowledged that he is "not making life very easy" for himself with small issues in races but looks forward to the title fight in the second half of the season.</p>
