          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local school district. A federal judge had ordered them to post the amount as a bond to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose the case. The lawsuit stems from their sons being suspended and found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender student using the boys' locker room. The funds will allow their legal challenge, which contests the school's disciplinary actions and policies, to proceed.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, a move aimed at pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine. While Trump described it as a "big stop," he acknowledged that the halt would not be immediate and would involve a gradual process without a specified timeline. India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices, making this commitment a significant development in the U.S.-India relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate executives from major companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom at the White House. The administration states the 90,000-square-foot addition will be financed entirely by private donations, not taxpayers, and will allow for larger functions like state dinners. The president thanked attendees for their generosity, stating the project is now "fully taken care of." The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some who question the influence of corporate donors on the administration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is actively working to break a significant postseason slump, taking the rare step of participating in on-field batting practice. The two-way player has struggled at the plate, with only two hits in 25 at-bats and 12 strikeouts since the playoffs began. While manager Dave Roberts has noted some recent improvements in his at-bats, Ohtani's performance remains a key concern for the team's World Series ambitions. Ohtani himself downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent layoff notices to over 4,000 workers, with officials suggesting the total could exceed 10,000. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and suggested the administration was unlawfully using the shutdown to target programs and employees for political reasons, citing public statements by the president. The order protects workers represented by two unions that filed the lawsuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a new model to address the costly and controversial use of hotels for asylum seekers. The plan suggests the government should fund councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would be added to the social housing stock. This would allow current social housing tenants to move into new homes, freeing up their previous residences for asylum seekers at a fraction of the cost of hotels. The proposal aims to provide a more sustainable and integrated solution while increasing the nation's overall housing supply.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is essential, as individual states have begun to implement their own rules. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn emphasized the need for a federal standard to protect consumers and children from the risks associated with AI, such as data privacy violations and harmful content from chatbots. She argued that Congress must act to create a unified framework, despite opposition from large tech companies, to ensure consistent safeguards across the country for all citizens.</p>

          <p>Greensburg, Kansas, a town almost entirely wiped out by an EF-5 tornado in 2007, has rebuilt itself as a model of sustainability and resilience. In the aftermath of the disaster that killed 10 people, the community chose to embrace green energy, and today, it derives 100% of its electricity from wind power. This transition has provided long-term economic benefits, with electricity costs remaining remarkably stable for the past decade. The town's story of renewal has inspired former residents to return, drawn by the community's forward-thinking spirit.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the Trump administration has found a way to pay FBI agents during the ongoing government shutdown, which has left most federal workers without paychecks. While Patel did not specify the source of the funding, the move follows a similar action to ensure military service members receive their pay. The decision has raised questions about the administration's legal authority to allocate funds without congressional appropriation. The FBI Agents Association thanked the president but urged Congress to reopen the government to fund all bureau employees.</p>
