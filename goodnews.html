        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a method to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging these assets for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, thereby postponing the tax liability until the ETF shares are sold. However, this method has strict diversification requirements, mandating that no single stock can exceed 25% of the contributed assets and the top five assets cannot surpass 50%. While beneficial for tax deferral, financial advisors caution that investors' capital can become locked into the specific ETF with limited options for future transfers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has stated her desire to star in a major commercial film, such as a sequel to "A Minecraft Movie," in order to make "a pile of cash." In a recent interview, she contrasted the massive box office success of such blockbusters with the more modest earnings of her recent critically acclaimed films, like "Civil War." Dunst, whose career began at age three, noted that the Minecraft film earned more than her last three movies combined. The actress, whose highest-grossing film remains 2007's "Spider-Man 3," has several other projects lined up, including films with directors Ruben Östlund and Sofia Coppola.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly obtained public records reveal that protests targeting hotels housing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles prompted the U.S. military to create a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." The documents show that community-led demonstrations, some dubbed "No sleep for Ice," successfully disrupted federal immigration operations by creating pressure on the establishments. An email from the U.S. Marines indicates that multiple law enforcement agencies were tracking the protests and compiling information to prevent personnel from being "harassed." Activists involved view the records as confirmation that their strategy of targeting the agents' accommodations was effective.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to loosen federal restrictions on psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in 'magic mushrooms.' The review could lead to reclassifying psilocybin from a Schedule I drug, which has no accepted medical use, to a less restrictive Schedule II category, which acknowledges medical value despite potential for abuse. This development follows a long legal battle by a Seattle-based doctor seeking to use the substance for end-of-life care. While a growing body of research suggests psilocybin's benefits for mental health conditions, some experts urge caution and call for a careful review of scientific evidence before expanding access.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun to move away from the North Carolina coast, but the National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast.

The large storm is generating dangerous ocean conditions, with forecasters noting that a buoy in its path recorded a maximum wave height of 45 feet. Officials are urging the public to heed local warnings and avoid swimming at many beaches due to the hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has publicly offered strong support for New Delhi in its trade disputes with the United States, urging the two nations to collaborate against what he termed a "bully." The envoy condemned the steep tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India and stated that "China will firmly stand with India" to uphold the multilateral trading system. This unusual display of solidarity occurs as both countries face aggressive tariff policies from the Trump administration. The statement positions Beijing as an ally to New Delhi in the face of shared economic pressure from Washington.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a price increase for its Apple TV+ streaming service in the United States, raising the monthly subscription cost from $9.99 to $12.99. The new pricing is effective immediately for new subscribers, while current customers will see the change on their next billing cycle after a 30-day notice period. The annual subscription price will remain unchanged at $99.99. This marks the second price hike for the service in less than two years, following an increase from $6.99 to $9.99 in October 2023, as the company continues to invest in original content like "The Morning Show" and "Severance."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, debt forgiveness programs are an option for certain struggling consumers, though not everyone qualifies. Generally, candidates for this form of relief are those facing serious financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. This article notes that individuals typically need to have a substantial amount of unsecured debt, often $7,500 or more, to be considered by debt relief companies. Furthermore, consumers who are already significantly behind on their payments are more likely to qualify, as creditors become more willing to negotiate a settlement to avoid a total loss.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in their civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on "excessive fines." However, the five-judge panel upheld the original finding by Judge Arthur Engoron that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to obtain favorable financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, such as the installation of an independent monitor, were also upheld by the court to curb the company's business practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed admitting to doing so. The primary motivations behind this shift are cost savings and a preference for smaller portion sizes, as kids' meals are typically less expensive than standard adult entrees. This behavior reflects broader consumer cutbacks on dining out amid economic uncertainty, as major chains like McDonald's have reported sluggish sales. Diners report that the simpler options and lower prices on kids' menus are making them an increasingly attractive choice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a significant labor shortage in the skilled trades. The industry is struggling to find enough qualified electricians, HVAC technicians, and plumbers to build and maintain these complex facilities. This demand is intensifying competition for a shrinking pool of blue-collar workers, as many older tradespeople are retiring and fewer young people are pursuing these careers. With hundreds of thousands of skilled trade jobs currently unfilled, experts predict the shortage could worsen, potentially impacting the growth of the digital economy.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates showing a downward trend, financial experts are advising homeowners with higher-interest loans to begin preparing for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include obtaining and reviewing credit reports from all three major bureaus to check for errors that could negatively impact credit scores. Homeowners should also protect their scores by avoiding new credit applications and making all payments on time. Additionally, gathering essential documents like proof of income, homeowners insurance, and existing mortgage statements will allow for a quick and opportunistic response when rates become favorable.

          <p>Chipotle is launching a pilot program for autonomous drone delivery in the Dallas area through a new partnership with Zipline. The service, dubbed "Zipotle," will allow select customers to order from the full menu and have their food delivered by Zipline's autonomous aircraft. The drones will pick up orders from a single restaurant location and deliver them to customers' homes by hovering at a high altitude while a smaller robot lowers the package to the ground. This initiative represents Chipotle's latest move to embrace technology and innovate its delivery options, particularly to appeal to its younger consumer base.</p>
