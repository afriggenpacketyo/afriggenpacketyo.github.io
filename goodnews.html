          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, sending it to the President to be signed into law. This legislation aims to make the "math error" notices sent by the IRS for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more understandable for taxpayers. Currently, filers have 60 days to respond to these often confusing notices before the IRS's proposed changes become final. Proponents like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue the bill will help ordinary people correct honest mistakes without needing expensive legal help, improving transparency and communication from the tax agency.</p>

          <p>A Commerce Department official has refuted a report claiming the Trump administration was negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story suggesting the government was considering exchanging federal funding for ownership, similar to recent deals in the semiconductor and rare earth industries. Quantum computing is considered a sector vital to national security due to its potential military applications, such as breaking encryption. While the industry attracts significant investment, it has yet to generate substantial revenue, with the technology still in a research-heavy phase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is undergoing a significant strategic shift, moving away from its traditional budget-carrier model to appeal more to premium travelers. The airline will eliminate its long-standing open-boarding policy in favor of assigned seating and introduce options for paid upgrades, including seats with extra legroom. Other planned enhancements include new cabins, larger overhead bins, and improved Wi-Fi. These changes, set to roll out in the new year, follow the airline's recent decision to begin charging for checked bags. This pivot reflects a broader industry trend where even budget airlines are adding premium perks to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial conglomerate Honeywell rallied 7% after the company reported strong quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The firm's organic revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and profit margins all met or exceeded the high end of its own guidance. The positive results have generated investor optimism ahead of the planned spin-off of its advanced materials business, Solstice, next week. Analysts suggest the spin-off will help clarify the value of Honeywell's core businesses, particularly its robust aerospace division, which had previously been weighed down by the complexity of the company's overall structure.

          <p>Shares of Kering, the French luxury group, closed up nearly 9% after it reported a narrower sales decline and better-than-expected quarterly earnings, signaling a potential turnaround. While sales at its flagship brand, Gucci, fell 14% year-on-year, this marked a significant sequential improvement from the 25% plunge seen in the previous quarter. The performance has boosted investor confidence in the new CEO's strategy to revitalize the company. Kering is focusing on its core fashion businesses, recently agreeing to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal, as it works to navigate weakening demand in the high-end goods sector.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching their highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. The rise is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers. Despite the increase in sales and a slight rise in housing inventory, the market remains tight, continuing to put upward pressure on prices. The median home price was $415,200, marking a 2.1% increase from the previous year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains, with prices now 53% higher than pre-pandemic levels.
