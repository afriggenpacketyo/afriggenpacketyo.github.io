          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut, following Sony Group's spin-off of the unit. This strategic separation allows the financial arm to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. The parent company cited competing demands for investment in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the financial unit to operate independently. This strong debut reflects positive investor sentiment amidst broader gains in most Asian markets, despite some regional declines and ongoing economic tensions.</p>

          <p>This article discusses "energy vampires" in friendships—individuals who drain your energy through constant complaining, self-absorption, or lack of interest in your life. Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as excessive attention-seeking and subtle mood erosion. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests assessing how you feel after interactions. The article proposes three strategies: honest communication to express feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if behavior doesn't change, and altering shared activities to reduce dominance.

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels, building on existing LNG and biodiesel operations, hinge on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. He emphasized the need for tax-free mainland-produced methanol to be brought into, stored, and sold in Hong Kong. Wang's comments were made during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. The company expects to increase green methanol usage from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions tariffs.</p>

The fee will include museum and windmill access, currently separate charges. While local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business, the council intends to use the revenue for maintenance and infrastructure. Tourist opinions are divided on the new charge.</p>
