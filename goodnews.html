          <p>House GOP leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, are working to reassure Republicans that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track, despite facing delays. Disagreements persist within the party over issues like the state and local tax deduction and Medicaid cuts. Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their work, but some key panels have yet to schedule votes. Johnson expressed confidence that the House would complete its work by Memorial Day, though some lawmakers cast doubt on meeting that deadline.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have seen steady interest rate declines this year, but rates are likely to remain stable this week as the Federal Reserve meets. While a rate cut is not expected this week, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could influence future HELOC rates. Optimistic remarks about potential rate cuts in June or July could cause HELOC rates to decline, while cautionary statements could have the opposite effect. Currently, HELOCs are a cost-effective borrowing option compared to other loan types. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Palantir experienced a significant drop of 14% despite exceeding revenue expectations and raising its full-year revenue guidance. Analysts cited concerns about modest full-year revenue guidance and a decline in international commercial revenue as reasons for the stock's decline. Palantir reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, with revenues rising 39% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp remains optimistic, describing Palantir as "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth around May 10. Experts predict the half-ton mass of metal could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, traveling at 150 mph. While the risk of hitting someone is small, it cannot be completely excluded, as the spacecraft was built to withstand atmospheric reentry. Experts are uncertain if the heat shield will remain intact, which could affect the object's disintegration upon reentry.</p>

          <p>A late payment on a credit report can negatively impact one's financial stability, affecting loan rates, apartment rentals, and job prospects. To mitigate the damage, individuals can request a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, dispute inaccuracies with credit bureaus, or negotiate a "pay for delete" arrangement. While late payments remain on credit reports for up to seven years, their impact lessens over time, and consistently making on-time payments helps rebuild credit. (not investment advice)</p>
