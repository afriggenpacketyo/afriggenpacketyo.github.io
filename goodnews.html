          <p>During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement between the U.S. and the UK. He mistakenly referred to the agreement as being with the European Union and downplayed the differences between the displayed agreement and one signed in May. The White House clarified that the agreement involved steel and aluminum, with the Commerce Secretary determining quotas for products entering the U.S. without tariffs. Trump complimented Starmer's performance as Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza performed a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Dodger Stadium, sparking discussions about the song's origins and the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Latina composer. In 1945, Arias was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to create a Spanish version of the national anthem, known as "El Pend√≥n Estrellado," to strengthen ties with Latin American countries during World War II. The performance has also highlighted the contributions of Latino people to the nation. Arias' work remained largely unknown until 2006, when her grandson discovered drafts of the sheet music, leading to exhibits and recordings honoring her legacy.</p>

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, a pioneer of the Chinese internet, advises students to bypass graduate school and postpone start-up plans. Citing his own experience, Zhang suggested that college graduates should first gain experience working at a company before starting their own businesses. Zhang founded Internet Technologies China in 1996, which became the first mainland internet company to raise venture capital funding and later became Sohu.com. He believes practical experience is more valuable than advanced degrees for entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the global supply chain, particularly in rare earth elements, provides leverage in trade negotiations with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in modern technologies, including electronics, electric vehicles, and military applications. China's control over these resources has allowed it to achieve a framework agreement with the U.S. in high-level trade talks, marking a shift from previous negotiations during the first term of President Trump. This highlights the strategic importance of rare earth elements in international trade relations.</p>
