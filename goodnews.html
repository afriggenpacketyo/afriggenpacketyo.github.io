          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk posted a 70% upswing in first-quarter operating profit, exceeding analyst expectations, while maintaining its full-year guidance. The company, a key indicator of global trade, reported underlying EBITDA of $2.71 billion. Despite the positive results, Maersk revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.
