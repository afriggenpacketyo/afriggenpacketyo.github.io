The jackpot carries an estimated cash value of $634.3 million before taxes, though it was not immediately confirmed if there were any winners. This prize marks the sixth-largest in lottery history and has grown due to no grand prize winner since May 31. Powerball officials encourage responsible play, noting that a single $2 ticket offers a 1 in 292.2 million chance of winning.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both climbed, with Australian household spending showing robust growth. Globally, bond markets remain a focus, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield surpassing 5% for the first time since July, partly influenced by a court ruling against Trump administration tariffs. This reflects ongoing economic uncertainty alongside sector-specific optimism, particularly in technology.</p>

Representatives from eight countries are participating in the 14-day Beijing course, covering safety, airworthiness, and new technologies. This initiative aims to expand China's influence in the aviation market, challenging the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing, especially as Southeast Asia increasingly adopts Chinese aircraft.

          <p>Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media app often compared to Instagram, has seen its valuation surge by 19% in three months to $31 billion, according to recent fund transactions. This rapid increase highlights strong investor demand for a viable Chinese competitor to platforms like TikTok, especially amidst potential bans for the latter in the US. The valuation was revealed through portfolio documents from GSR Ventures, a major early backer. The company's growth reflects renewed confidence in China's start-up scene following government pledges of support for private firms.</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is actively exploring a bid to return to the Senate in New Hampshire, a move welcomed by senior White House officials. Sununu, part of a prominent political family, is seen as a strong recruit for Republicans in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, as Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is not seeking re-election. While New Hampshire has favored Republicans in gubernatorial races, Senate contests prove more challenging. Sununu stated he would seriously consider a run and aims to appeal broadly, including to President Trump's supporters.</p>

The move aligns with a broader trend of the Pentagon offering benefits and consideration to Trump supporters, including military funeral honors for a January 6th Capitol rioter.

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by Nazis during World War Two, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before it was seized by Hermann Göring. Its discovery came after Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing for a property belonging to a daughter of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who escaped to Argentina.

          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' shares jumped 25% after the fashion retailer attributed strong sales to viral advertising campaigns featuring celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Despite a 1% sales slip in the May-July period, the company now forecasts low single-digit sales growth, driven by increased customer awareness and engagement. The controversial 'Great Jeans' ad with Sydney Sweeney generated significant impressions and sold out her signature jeans. Even President Trump weighed in, supporting Sweeney. The company also reported halving projected tariff costs through supplier negotiations and sourcing shifts, indicating a positive outlook for the autumn season.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was illegal, calling it a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." Judge Allison Burroughs found the administration violated Harvard's First Amendment rights, using antisemitism as a "smokescreen" to impose ideological and pedagogical demands. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars their enforcement, affirming Harvard's academic freedom and critical research. The White House, however, vowed to appeal the decision, maintaining Harvard's ineligibility for future grants.</p>
