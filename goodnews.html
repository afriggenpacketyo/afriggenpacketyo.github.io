          <p>YouTube has announced it will soon launch a pilot program allowing creators whose channels were terminated for Covid-19 or election misinformation to apply for reinstatement. This marks a significant reversal of its previous policy, which treated such violations as lifetime bans. The change was revealed in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, following Republican pressure on tech companies to roll back content moderation policies from the Biden era. YouTube stated that its community guidelines now permit a wider range of content on these topics and that the new program will initially be open to a limited subset of creators.</p>

Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range and famous 'whistle register,' died of breast cancer in 1979 at age 31, cutting short a promising career. Despite her premature death, her music continues to influence a new generation of artists, with her work being sampled in hip-hop and featured in modern films like Jordan Peele's 'Us.'</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued in a five-hour operation after it fell into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well in Pembroke, Maine. The property owner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. A biologist sedated the moose, allowing wardens to use straps and an excavator to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedation wore off, the moose ran off, seemingly unharmed by the ordeal. The family, who was unaware of the well's existence on their property, has since capped it to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers since the 1970s. The team includes Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Ben Stokes, signaling a strategic shift away from the style of recently retired James Anderson. The selection aims to counter Australia's powerful batting lineup on its home pitches, particularly in the opening Tests in Perth and Brisbane. While the bowling attack's potential is high, concerns remain about the injury history of several key players and the fitness of captain Ben Stokes.</p>

          <p>OpenAI and Nvidia have announced a landmark $100 billion partnership to jointly build the next generation of AI supercomputing facilities. The deal, negotiated directly by CEOs Sam Altman and Jensen Huang, involves Nvidia investing in OpenAI through a series of $10 billion tranches while also supplying its advanced processors for new data centers. This agreement deepens the ties between the two AI giants, concentrating significant capital and influence as they aim to solve what Altman calls an 'unprecedented infrastructure challenge.' The first of the planned 10-gigawatt AI data center sites is expected to go online in late 2026.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System, commonly known as 'robot umpires,' starting in the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes on the field. Each team will be allowed two challenges per game, which they retain if successful, to have a call reviewed by the Hawk-Eye camera technology. The move is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments, as MLB data indicates that over 60% of ejections are related to disputes over ball and strike calls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lesser-known provision called the 'birthday rule,' available in about 18 states, offers Medicare beneficiaries an annual window to switch Medigap supplemental insurance plans without facing medical underwriting. This allows seniors to change to a plan with equal or lesser benefits around their birthday, regardless of pre-existing health conditions that would normally prevent them from switching. The rule provides financial flexibility, as it enables individuals to seek more affordable premiums for identical coverage from different insurers. However, the specific regulations, such as the length of the enrollment window, vary significantly by state, requiring beneficiaries to understand their local provisions.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the estimated monthly cost for a $60,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has been calculated. With an average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year term or $575 for a 15-year term. The article notes that these costs are slightly lower than earlier in the year and discusses the potential for further reductions if the Fed continues to cut rates. The flexibility of a HELOC, where payments are only on the amount used, is highlighted as a key advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a potential massive aircraft order from China as a key reason for a positive outlook on Boeing's stock. Reports suggest that U.S. and Chinese officials are in the final stages of negotiating a deal for hundreds of Boeing jets as part of broader trade discussions. This development follows a pattern where countries seeking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. make large purchases from the aircraft manufacturer. The potential China deal, along with recent orders from Turkey and Uzbekistan, is seen as a significant catalyst for the company's financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Powell's remarks come amid an unprecedented campaign by the White House to reshape the Fed's board. He reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, acknowledging the current challenge of balancing upside risks to inflation with downside risks to employment.

This is the first time since the war began that a group has been assisted in leaving the territory for educational purposes in the UK. The students, all of whom hold fully funded scholarships, were taken to Jordan to complete visa checks before traveling. While celebrating the opportunity, a coordinator noted the students face the difficult process of settling in while their families remain in Gaza.

          <p>Luther Campbell, frontman of the controversial 1980s rap group 2 Live Crew, advises Jimmy Kimmel to fight back against government pressure, drawing parallels to his own landmark legal battle over free speech. Campbell's group was targeted by Florida officials for their album 'As Nasty as They Wanna Be,' leading to obscenity charges and arrests, but he ultimately won on appeal, setting a key precedent for artistic expression. He argues that if Kimmel and his network capitulate to pressure from the FCC and the Trump administration, it will set a dangerous precedent for censoring other media figures. Campbell framed the situation as a critical fight to protect First Amendment rights.</p>
