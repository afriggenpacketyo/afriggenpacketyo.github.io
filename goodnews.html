          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancestral Origins of Indigenous Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 02:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent DNA study has provided insights into the migration patterns of the first people to colonize the Americas, tracing their origins back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, comparing them to ancient DNA to understand population history, migration, and adaptation. The study identified four distinct groups in South America‚ÄîAmazonian, Andean, Chaco Amerindian, and Patagonian‚Äîthat became isolated due to natural barriers like the Amazon rainforest and the Andes mountain range. These findings underscore the importance of ancestral knowledge for Indigenous communities and highlight genetic variations that affect their health, such as adaptations to low oxygen levels in Andean highlanders.</p>

          <p>During the US PGA Championship, golfers Shane Lowry and Tyrrell Hatton exhibited visible frustration on the course, resulting in potential fines for their behavior. Lowry slammed his club into the turf and swore after being denied relief for an embedded ball, while Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Hatton, who was briefly near the lead, finished his round seven shots behind the leader, Jhonattan Vegas, with Lowry missing the cut. This article notes that Hatton has a history of on-course outbursts, previously drawing criticism for his conduct during the DP World Tour Championship.</p>

Roberts, who earned 94 caps for Wales and was a British and Irish Lion, balanced his medical studies with his rugby career, eventually completing his undergraduate degree in 2013. After a decade focused on rugby, Roberts passed a "return to medicine" exam and is now preparing for two years of foundation training in hospitals in south Wales, with an interest in specializing in sports medicine or orthopaedics. Roberts expressed respect for NHS workers and excitement for the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Two countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St Lucia, sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, signaling a flexible approach by mainland China in courting Taipei's remaining official partners. According to analysts, this participation does not necessarily indicate a shift in allegiance but reflects a trend towards more pragmatic diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had notified them in advance of their officials' attendance and that relations remained "friendly and stable". The flags of Guatemala and Belize, two other Celac members that have ties with Taiwan, were not seen at the forum.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang, pending further litigation. The ruling suggests that a majority of justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections under the Alien Enemies Act. The court has sent the case back to an appeals court to examine the migrants' claims and consider the notice required for deportation challenges. The article also mentions a New Jersey Transit strike that left commuters scrambling and a failed Republican effort to pass a major domestic policy bill.</p>

Residents described the event as "something out of the history books," with dust causing discomfort and debris blowing in the wind.

In Saudi Arabia, he received a standing ovation for lifting sanctions on Syria, while in Qatar, he secured billions of dollars in investment pledges. The United Arab Emirates awarded him the country‚Äôs highest civilian honor, and he praised the ‚Äúperfect marble‚Äù and ‚Äúthose camels.‚Äù Trump surrounded himself with friendly audiences and turned events into campaign-style rallies, reiterating false claims about the 2020 election and hinting at an unconstitutional third term.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment, aid, and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its influence on the continent through strategic investments in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. The Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan, with investments primarily made by corporations closely aligned with the ruling powers. While the Trump administration has fast-tracked America‚Äôs exit from Africa, Washington considers the Emirates a reliable ally in the region, but may underestimate the commercial partnership between the Emirates and China.</p>
