          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in U.S. lottery history, totaling nearly $1.8 billion, has been claimed by two winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. These fortunate players will share the immense prize, ending a remarkable 42-drawing streak without a top winner that spanned over three months, tying a game record. The winners face a choice between a substantial lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or an annuity option of $893.5 million spread across 30 increasing annual payments.

          <p>The BBC has introduced an engaging interactive online tool, "Cooler Than Me?", designed to allow users to compare their local weather conditions against various cities worldwide. This playful feature caters to the British inclination for weather commentary, inviting individuals to determine if their current location is indeed more "green and pleasant" than other global spots. The tool's objective is to foster public engagement with meteorological data and potentially inspire a new wave of amateur meteorologists. Users can easily access the latest forecasts and utilize this comparative function via the BBC Weather website, transforming everyday weather observations into an interactive experience.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support for Mamdani's progressive campaign against oligarchic control. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, vows to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the wealthiest 1%, policies that have drawn significant grassroots enthusiasm but also opposition from billionaires and some mainstream Democrats. Sanders lauded Mamdani's campaign as a "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail," criticizing the muted support from state Democratic leaders. The event underscored the campaign's focus on representing working people and fighting for social justice.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a resounding 59-20 victory over Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team, showcasing an explosive offense that amassed 755 yards, their most in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the charge with four touchdowns and 412 passing yards, while the rushing attack contributed an impressive 309 yards, marking the most of the Lincoln Riley era. Despite the offensive dominance, coach Riley noted defensive breakdowns and six penalties, suggesting the team is "a long ways off from our best." The game provided valuable experience for backups and highlighted USC's significant offensive firepower, though the coach emphasized continuous improvement is necessary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, release a powerful force. This allows the small jumpers to be propelled up to 1.5 meters into the air. Scientists can control the light flow to dictate launch points and even enable swimming, demonstrating cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism. This scientific advancement holds potential for various applications in robotics.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including those in New York, are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. These pouches, which students carry but can only unlock with school-affixed magnets, aim to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment. While some students welcome the change, others are skeptical or seek ways to bypass the system. Educators and the company's CEO emphasize creating "phone-free spaces" to help students experience life outside a digital realm, despite concerns about costs and initial implementation challenges, with many teachers reporting positive changes in classroom dynamics.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball memorabilia after a viral incident where an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game. Footage showed the ball, hit by Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, landing near the boy before an adult man, identified as his father, initially gave it to him. The woman then confronted the man, claiming the ball was hers, and took it. Both the Phillies and Marlins teams intervened, with a Marlins staffer giving the boy a gift bag, and Bader himself meeting the fan to give him an autographed bat, transforming a disappointing moment into a memorable experience.</p>
