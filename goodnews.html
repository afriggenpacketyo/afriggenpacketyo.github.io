          <p>Brazilian meat giant JBS experienced a rise in shares during its U.S. public market debut, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. The company's listing on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker "JBS," was delayed by one day due to operational procedures. JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company, has a history of corruption and bribery allegations, leading to opposition from lawmakers. Despite past scandals, the SEC approved JBS's request to list, and shareholders narrowly approved the move, marking a significant step in the company's long journey to the U.S. market.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to host a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, marking the capital's first major military parade in over three decades. While military parades have occurred throughout U.S. history, they are relatively rare and typically commemorate the end of wars or the return of military personnel. Past parades include those marking the end of the Gulf War, Cold War inaugurations, and celebrations of World Wars I and II. Such events have sometimes faced criticism due to costs and appropriateness, especially in the context of ongoing conflicts.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley attributed a recent factory shutdown to a shortage of rare earth minerals, which are essential for automobile production. The shortage stems from China's export controls on these materials amid trade tensions with the U.S. While the U.S. and China have reached an agreement to resume regular exports, the process of securing licenses remains challenging. Ford is optimistic about trade talk developments and awaits approval of pending export applications, but the situation highlights the vulnerability of global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, typically used for unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans.
