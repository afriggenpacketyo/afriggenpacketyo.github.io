          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, with revenue lower than previous holidays, even though a Hollywood film, "Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning," led ticket presales. The article points out that box office revenue for the first day of the festival was estimated at 122 million yuan, which is less than the 177 million yuan earned on the first day of the last public holiday. This comes amid China's struggle to stimulate domestic consumption and a decline in overall box office revenue compared to previous years. Despite these challenges, observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market, citing improvements in domestic productions.</p>
