          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok another 90-day extension for its sale in the US, addressing national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deadline is now set for September 17, allowing more time for a deal to be reached. Lawmakers fear that TikTok or ByteDance could be compelled to share data on US users with the Chinese government, a claim TikTok denies. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the extension aims to ensure the deal is finalized, safeguarding American users' data.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. Read's second trial, which began after a mistrial, involved accusations that she hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The defense argued that Read was framed by law enforcement and others, presenting a complex narrative of events leading to O'Keefe's death. The case included scrutiny of evidence, allegations of a coverup, and dramatic courtroom battles over witness testimony and evidence.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" offers a unique take on the war film genre, focusing on the existential uncertainties of soldiers during the Civil War with minimal combat. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army in 1862, emphasizing their daily lives and internal reflections rather than traditional battle scenes. Minervini's naturalistic style and close relationship with his cast create a pensive atmosphere, exploring themes of economic inequality, brutality, and masculinity that continue to resonate in modern America.</p>

Public pools have been battlegrounds of racial tension, and many have become neglected and underfunded. Revitalizing public pools could help combat economic inequalities, senseless brutality and thwarted masculinity that will bedevil the nation for the next 160 years.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes from December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The ban, passed in the Senedd, prohibits supplying wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business transactions. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. The regulations add plastic wet wipes to a 2023 law prohibiting a list of single-use plastic products.</p>
