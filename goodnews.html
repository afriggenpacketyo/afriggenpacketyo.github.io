After undergoing exhausting chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and married, sharing her story to urge young people to be vigilant about their health and seek medical advice for any unusual symptoms.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, the first woman to co-host a nightly news broadcast in the U.S., has passed away at the age of 87, leaving behind a profound legacy at National Public Radio. Colleagues remember her for giving NPR its distinctive, irreverent, and conversational voice, which stood in stark contrast to the formal news anchors of the era. Stamberg championed the art of listening in interviews and believed in covering the full spectrum of human experience, from serious news to moments of levity, to create a program that felt like a companion in listeners' lives.</p>

          <p>Prominent figures from European women's football, including England's former general manager Anja van Ginhoven and FA technical director Kay Cossington, are joining Bay Collective, a new U.S.-based multi-club ownership group. The venture, which starts with San Francisco's Bay FC, aims to build a progressive and sustainable ecosystem for women's football clubs from the ground up. The leaders describe the move as shifting from a slow-moving "tanker" to a nimble "speedboat," allowing them to innovate quickly and build a player-centric, high-performance culture without the constraints of established federations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Pew Research Center indicates that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds choosing to marry again. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry have a child with their new spouse. The data also highlights a significant economic disparity, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being substantially higher than that of divorced individuals who remain single. Experts note that while remarriage is prevalent, second marriages also have a higher rate of divorce.</p>

          <p>As millions prepare for nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump, this article argues that the anti-Trump resistance movement's perceived earnestness, often dismissed as "cringe," is actually its greatest strength. The movement's idealism and sincere belief in democratic institutions serve as a powerful antidote to the cynicism and nihilism that fuel authoritarianism. While early protests were criticized for their aesthetics, their effectiveness was demonstrated through grassroots organizing that led to electoral victories. The article suggests that embracing sincere, community-based action is the most effective form of opposition in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Organizers expect millions of demonstrators to participate in the second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States, opposing what they describe as President Trump's monarchical behavior and policies. The movement cites concerns over aggressive immigration enforcement, cuts to federal education and environmental protections, and gerrymandering. While organizers emphasize a commitment to peaceful protest, some Republican governors have mobilized their state National Guards in preparation. The White House has dismissed the event, while House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled it a "hate America rally," highlighting the deep political divisions surrounding the demonstrations.</p>
