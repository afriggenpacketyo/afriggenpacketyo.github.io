          <p>During the recent summit in Alaska, Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter is said to address the plight of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred to Russia since the 2022 invasion, an act considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the First Lady's efforts, highlighting the issue of what some organizations call "state-sponsored child trafficking" on the international stage.</p>

This move from their current residence at Adelaide Cottage is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" for the family following a challenging period that included Catherine's cancer diagnosis. Royal sources suggest the couple views Forest Lodge as their long-term family home where they will live even after Prince William becomes King. The move is being funded privately by the couple.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters consist of four containers joined in an X-shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. This innovative approach aims to tackle the affordable housing crisis by utilizing existing materials, with each shelter unit taking only a week to construct. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from containers for low-income senior citizens.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company in the U.S. while deliberately avoiding industry norms like going public or making acquisitions. From Epic's whimsical 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin, she has grown the private company to $5.7 billion in annual revenue, making her net worth an estimated $7.8 billion. Faulkner has established a detailed succession plan to ensure Epic remains privately held after she is gone, with her voting shares transferring to a trust governed by family and longtime employees.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests saw a 13% nationwide drop in July compared to the previous month, slowing the pace of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions. While ICE has not commented on the decline, activists in states like Oregon believe their efforts are having an impact. In Portland, nightly protests and a "rapid-response" hotline that provides immediate legal aid to detainees may be impeding large-scale operations, particularly since ICE lacks an overnight detention facility within the state, complicating its enforcement process.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago.

          <p>Ge Changchun, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has called for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to compete with the United States. This technology involves building orbital facilities that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. Ge argues that China's current efforts are fragmented across universities and that a more coordinated, top-down national strategy is needed to close the technological gap with the U.S. in this emerging sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting philosophy known as the "Lighthouse Parent" is gaining traction as an alternative to the exhausting trend of intensive parenting. This approach, advocated by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children rather than controlling every aspect of their lives. The concept suggests that while the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, allowing them to struggle and navigate challenges on their own builds confidence and resilience. This stands in contrast to constant hovering, which can be damaging to a child's development.</p>

This seizure adds to the £2.7 million previously confiscated from the Tate brothers for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses.

While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and willingness to experiment with new technology are creating renewed competition.
