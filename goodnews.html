        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, contributing to an overall expansion of 6.5% for the full fiscal year. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports, which has helped cushion the impact of international trade policies. The nation is potentially poised to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S., following similar deals with China and the U.K. The Indian economy shows signs of stability, driven by internal demand and strategic trade positioning. The optimism score for this article is high, reflecting positive economic performance. </p>

          <p>A couple is participating in a study to test a nasal spray's ability to slow down Alzheimer's disease, with Joe Walsh being the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the experimental treatment. The nasal spray contains a monoclonal antibody aimed at reducing brain inflammation, a key factor in Alzheimer's progression. Early results indicate a reduction in inflammation in Walsh's brain, but it remains uncertain whether this will translate to improvements in cognitive function. The experimental treatment is part of a broader effort to explore new ways to interrupt the events that lead to Alzheimer's dementia. </p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, now questions the standard model of cosmology, which includes the concept of dark energy. Riess's precise observations of distant galaxies led to the discovery of dark energy, a repulsive force driving the universe's expansion. However, recent data suggests a discrepancy in the expansion rate, known as the Hubble tension, leading Riess to believe the standard model may be flawed. The possibility of revising the standard model has created tension among cosmologists, with some skeptical of the need for such a drastic change. </p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests that geopolitical shifts are creating an opportunity for the euro to gain greater international prominence as uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies weakens confidence in the U.S. dollar. Lagarde outlined three key foundations for the euro to increase its global influence, including maintaining open trade, reinforcing Europe's economic foundation, and bolstering its legal framework. A stronger euro could bring benefits such as lower borrowing costs and protection from sanctions. Some market watchers agree that the euro could rise as investors seek to diversify away from the dollar (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist challenges the traditional understanding of animal instincts, arguing that the term is confusing and unhelpful. He advocates for using the phrase "species-typical behavior" instead, which avoids presumptions about the behavior's origins or control. The article explores the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning in shaping animal behavior, using examples such as tailorbirds building nests and border collies herding sheep. The neuroscientist emphasizes that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning. </p>
