          <p>An anonymous researcher has launched a website called Panama Playlists, revealing the private music tastes of politicians and tech leaders, including VP JD Vance and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The creator claims to have used only publicly available information, scraping data from Spotify accounts over the past year to compile the playlists. The exposé highlights broader concerns about digital privacy and how much personal information is public by default on popular platforms. The article also provides tips for users on how to make their own streaming service playlists private to protect their data.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he recently underwent surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from the side of his face. He shared photos of the bandage and stitches on social media, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen, especially over the holiday weekend. Ramsay, who has previously shared health updates to promote safety, was praised for his transparency. Medical experts noted that basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and has a very high cure rate when detected and treated early.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole from a distance of 177 yards. This marks another significant milestone for the young golfer, who is steadily building his own reputation in the sport. His first recorded hole-in-one came just last December at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father, bringing him closer to his father's career total of 10 aces.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 frigates designed to counter Russian submarine threats in the North Atlantic. The agreement was hailed as a major success for the British defense industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary order preventing the U.S. government from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors. The ruling came after lawyers for the children, aged 10 to 17, filed an emergency request, stating the youths were being loaded onto planes in violation of laws that grant them due process and the right to seek asylum. The judge's order will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the legal process continues. The government argued it was reuniting the children with their parents, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all the winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, four tickets sold in Massachusetts won smaller prizes, including one worth $1 million and three worth $50,000. The upcoming Monday drawing will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31. This is the largest Powerball jackpot since a $1.326 billion prize was won in Oregon in April 2024, generating significant public interest and ticket sales across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During informal talks in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Key ideas discussed included the possibility of imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops into Ukraine itself once a ceasefire is achieved, signaling a long-term strategic commitment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has cleared 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by smashing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins, which had been devouring the kelp. This massive effort allowed the fast-growing "sequoias of the sea" to return, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and bolstering coastal resilience. The project serves as a successful model for restoring other degraded kelp forests around the globe.</p>

          <p>A pet sitter in Llanharan, Wales, had a surprising experience when the pregnant Labrador she was watching went into labor a week early and delivered 14 puppies.
