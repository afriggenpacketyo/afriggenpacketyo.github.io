          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department following a legal challenge from the city. After a federal judge expressed skepticism about the move's legality, the DOJ rescinded an order that had placed the DEA administrator in command of the local police force. Police Chief Pamela Smith will now retain her command, with the DEA official serving as an intermediary between the White House and the department. The agreement marks a significant de-escalation in the conflict over federal authority and local autonomy in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first-ever accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed to be sold as a condominium, separate from the main property. This development follows a city law passed last year to enable such sales, creating a new and more affordable path to homeownership. Officials hope this "ADU condo" will serve as a model for other cities in the state, potentially establishing a new generation of starter homes amid a persistent housing crisis. While ADUs now account for a significant portion of new housing growth, this innovation could further expand their role in addressing housing affordability.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel to Illinois but fulfilled his commitment remotely from his home in Virginia. The original agreement was made in the early 2000s with the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, who was a longtime admirer of Gabriel's work. Gabriel, who led the U.S. Air Force Band to international acclaim, stated that "your word is your bond," emphasizing the importance of honoring his promise.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline is a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary source of the region's poor air quality, which contributes to high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. Researchers suggest that pollution from agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads are more significant factors. The report's lead author recommends pivoting from source control at the sea to protecting people indoors with air filters and improved weatherization.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may not be as detrimental to blood sugar as once thought. Two clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation as a replacement for other carbohydrates, like white bread, could produce a similar or even lower glycemic response. One eight-week study showed that participants with type 2 diabetes who ate 250g of mango for breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers. Researchers emphasize that the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption but indicate that mangoes can be part of a controlled diet.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by altering an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant to depict him in a Dodgers baseball jersey instead of his classic Lakers uniform. The artwork is part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while every restaurant location features a Kobe mural, he wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme while still capturing Bryant's famous "Mamba mentality." The creative choice has elicited mixed but mostly positive reactions from fans.</p>

          <p>Liverpool opened their Premier League season with a dramatic 4-2 victory against Bournemouth at Anfield, a match filled with emotional tributes and standout performances. New signing Hugo Ekitike was the star for Liverpool, scoring the opening goal and assisting another, making an immediate impact following his £70 million transfer. Despite the win, which was secured by late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah, the match exposed defensive vulnerabilities in the reigning champions' side. Bournemouth's spirited performance, including a fine equalizer from Antoine Semenyo, created a tense and chaotic atmosphere for the season's inaugural game.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea industry is experiencing explosive growth, with three major Chinese chains recently raising over $700 million in Hong Kong listings. Companies like Mixue Group, which now has more outlets than McDonald's, are expanding rapidly through a franchise-heavy model that relies on selling ingredients and equipment to store owners. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including intense price wars, market saturation in China, and the difficulties of maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised locations. Analysts question whether the high valuations are sustainable as these brands attempt to prove they are a lasting consumer staple rather than a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is planning to sell a simple, barebones electric pickup truck for approximately half the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs by offering a basic two-seat truck and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 accessories, including an SUV conversion kit. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is tapping into consumer demand for more affordable EVs, a market segment that has been challenged by rising prices and reduced federal incentives. The key question is whether its price point will remain competitive without tax credits.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's move to federalize the Washington D.C. police force, key Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the takeover. Citing the Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the "special emergency conditions" required to legally assume control of the local department. The sponsors, including Representative Jamie Raskin and Senator Chris Van Hollen, called the action a "lawless" and unprecedented attack on the district's autonomy. This legislative maneuver represents a formal congressional pushback against what Democrats see as a politically motivated overreach of executive power.</p>

          <p>Fergus McCreadie, an award-winning Scottish jazz pianist, was initially skeptical when he received a call from acclaimed film director Spike Lee, thinking it was a scam. However, the offer was genuine, and McCreadie and his trio were soon flown to New York to work on the score for Lee's new crime thriller, "Highest 2 Lowest." Lee had become a fan of McCreadie's music and even flew to Edinburgh to watch him perform live before the collaboration. The director wanted to incorporate McCreadie's track "Stony Gate" into the film's main score, creating a surreal and career-defining experience for the musician.</p>
