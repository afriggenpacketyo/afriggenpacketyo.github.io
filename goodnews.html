          <p>Donald Trump has agreed to extend trade negotiations with the European Union until July 9, averting a potential trade war after threatening to impose 50% tariffs on all EU imports. The decision followed a discussion with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested additional time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Trump had previously expressed frustration with the slow pace of negotiations, but von der Leyen's assurance of swift progress led to the extension. The EU has also expressed a commitment to securing a deal that works for both sides, guided by mutual respect.</p>

          <p>The Argentine comic "El Eternauta," a dystopian story about a group of friends battling a deadly snowfall, has gained global popularity with its recent Netflix adaptation.
