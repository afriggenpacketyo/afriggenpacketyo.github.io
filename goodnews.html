          <h2>MLB Commissioner to Propose Automated Strike Zone Amid Potential Lockout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 21:59:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred plans to propose an automated balls and strikes (ABS) system for the 2026 season, aiming to refine the process based on spring training trials. The system, which allows batters, pitchers, or catchers to challenge calls, aims to improve accuracy, though Manfred acknowledges the need for player acceptance. This significant change comes amid looming collective bargaining agreement discussions, with Manfred expressing confidence despite past concerns about implementing changes before bargaining. The average ABS challenge in the minor leagues has taken 17 seconds, so this should not affect the pace of play. The implementation of ABS would mark a substantial shift in baseball, potentially altering the game's dynamics and strategy. Optimism in the system is high given the success in the minor leagues.</p>

          <p>Portugal secured a 2-1 victory against Germany in the Nations League semifinal, despite Joshua Kimmich's milestone 100th appearance for Germany and his assist for their first goal. Cristiano Ronaldo, playing his 220th game for Portugal, scored the winning goal, marking his 137th international goal and ending his personal losing streak against Germany. Kimmich expressed disappointment in Germany's performance, citing a lack of energy and activity, while Portugal's coach praised Ronaldo's enduring hunger for victory. The game was delayed due to a storm, but Ronaldo's performance stole the show, leading Portugal to the Nations League final. This win adds to Ronaldo's legacy and highlights Portugal's strong team performance.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Reveals How Bird Feather Fossils Shed Light on Avian Evolution</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The research highlights how the development of these feathers enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The study, which examined feathers dating back 99 million years, focused on the structural evolution of feathers during the Cretaceous period. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities as modern birds, although some species may have been capable of gliding or powered flight. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of avian evolution.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a baby's gut may offer protection against dangerous infections. The research indicates that infants with the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum in their gut had a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for lung infections. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, tracked the babies' health for two years. The protective effect was primarily observed in babies born via vaginal delivery, as opposed to caesarean section. Researchers believe the bacteria or compounds produced by it interact with the immune system, aiding in its maturation and ability to distinguish between harmful and harmless substances.</p>

          <p>Health experts are advising women using weight-loss injections to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, as the impact of these medications on unborn babies is unknown. The warning applies to popular GLP-1 medicines such as Wegovy and Mounjaro. Concerns are rising about the unsafe use of these drugs due to their increasing popularity and availability through unregulated sources. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while on these medications and for a period after stopping, also noting that weight-loss injections may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in overweight or obese women.</p>
