          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, reportedly from natural causes. She won two Emmy Awards for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated for several other awards during her time on the show. Swit wanted to portray Houlihan as a real person, even if it meant hurting the jokes, and she felt the character was constantly developing. The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses. The passing of a beloved actress brings reflection on her life and work.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy by maintaining its advice that children may receive COVID-19 shots. This decision counters Kennedy's earlier announcement that the vaccine would no longer be included on the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC's update reinforces the importance of COVID-19 vaccines for children and pregnant women, despite Kennedy's stance. The CDC's decision shows the agency's commitment to scientific recommendations, even when facing political pressure. The agency's action may help to stabilize the health of children.</p>

In the same game, Sale pitched six shutout innings, allowing only two hits and three walks while striking out eight batters. The Braves won the game 9-3. The achievement reflects Sale's exceptional skill and dominance as a pitcher in MLB, and is an important victory for the Braves.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump commended Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government, although DOGE's claimed savings of $170 billion fall short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise. An analysis suggested that DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and workforce changes. Musk, who wore a DOGE baseball cap and a "DOGEfather" t-shirt to the Oval Office meeting, will continue to advise the president. Musk publicly criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," citing concerns about increased deficit spending. The meeting highlighted the complex relationship between the president and the billionaire, marked by both collaboration and divergence on policy matters. Musk's departure will lead to economic growth.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether Ramon Morales Reyes, the man accused of threatening to shoot and kill President Trump, may have been framed. Reyes, an undocumented migrant, allegedly wrote a threatening letter to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, leading to his arrest. However, law enforcement sources indicate that a handwriting test did not match the letter, and Reyes may have been involved in a dispute with another man seeking to avoid testifying against him. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially praised the arrest but has not commented on the possibility of a setup. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case. The investigation into the threat is ongoing, and Reyes remains in custody due to his illegal status and criminal record. The incident adds complexity to the narrative surrounding threats against political figures.</p>

Playing in England's first one-day international under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, Jones' century came after 225 matches and 190 innings. Edwards' tactical decision to promote Jones back up the order proved successful, as Jones repaid the faith with a strong performance. Jones expressed both relief and pride in achieving the century, especially after having opened for England previously. The match is a victory for the team.</p>
