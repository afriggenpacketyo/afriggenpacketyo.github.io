        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India, expanding factories with partners like Tata Group and Foxconn, as it seeks to reduce reliance on China. This move comes amidst rising U.S. pressure on India due to its purchases of sanctioned Russian oil, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threatening increased tariffs. Despite these geopolitical tensions, Apple's investment in U.S. manufacturing, including a $600 billion commitment, is expected to mitigate potential tariff impacts. The expansion in India also includes plans for a new iPhone 17e model next year, signaling a strategic shift in global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that Intel must provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funding, converting what was previously a grant into an investment for the American people. This proposal, which would not grant voting rights, comes as the Trump administration considers deeper involvement with the struggling chipmaker. Intel has already finalized an $8 billion grant and is building factories in Ohio, but has faced challenges in the AI semiconductor market. Lutnick suggests similar equity deals could be pursued with other CHIPS recipients, signaling a shift in government investment strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent high-level meetings, discussions are intensifying around U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, aimed at ensuring post-war peace. While the specifics remain unclear, the concept includes "Article 5-like protection" akin to NATO's collective defense, though direct NATO membership is off the table. Experts suggest guarantees could involve air support, intelligence sharing, and military supplies, rather than a large deployment of U.S. ground troops, which President Trump has ruled out. The goal is to establish an enduring Western commitment to Ukraine's security, enabling it to build its own defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>NASA's Webb Space Telescope has identified a previously unknown, tiny moon orbiting Uranus, expanding the planet's known lunar count to 29. The newly spotted moon, estimated to be just six miles wide, was observed by the telescope's near-infrared camera in February. Scientists believe its small size and faintness allowed it to remain undetected for so long, even eluding the Voyager 2 spacecraft decades ago. This discovery adds to our understanding of the solar system and Uranus's satellite system, with all known Uranian moons named after Shakespearean and Alexander Pope characters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively working to arrange a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be their first face-to-face interaction in over three years. Trump expressed hope for the summit, emphasizing the need for both leaders to show flexibility for a peace deal. This initiative follows a series of White House meetings where Zelenskyy and European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine. While a date is not set, the talks are seen as a significant step towards ending the conflict, with U.S. coordination on security provisions.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial savings, high-yield savings accounts offer a compelling alternative to traditional options, providing significantly higher interest rates. A $150,000 deposit could realistically earn over $6,500 in interest over a year, assuming a consistent 4.35% APY, far exceeding typical bank returns. While rates are variable, these accounts offer safety and flexibility, with many compounding interest daily. Savers are advised to consider factors beyond just APY, such as fees and customer service, to maximize their returns and avoid losing value to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The senior living real estate market is on the cusp of a significant boom as millions of baby boomers approach age 80, but supply is critically low. Annual inventory growth in senior housing has dropped below 1%, creating a massive supply-demand imbalance. Companies like Ventas are investing heavily in existing properties, benefiting from high demand and rising development costs that deter new construction. High interest rates are a primary roadblock for developers like Aegis Living, leading to a severe lack of new units despite the projected need for 100,000 new beds annually through 2040.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global Ratings has reaffirmed its AA+ credit rating for the U.S. with a stable outlook, attributing the decision partly to new revenue generated by the Trump administration's tariffs. The agency noted that this tariff income is expected to largely offset the financial impact of tax cuts from the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Despite concerns about high U.S. debt, deficits, and a slowing economy, S&P highlighted the nation's resilient economy and strong growth compared to peers. However, economists warn that while tariffs boost government finances, they increase costs for American consumers and businesses.</p>

The church's decision to return the land serves as a powerful act of reconciliation, setting a precedent for other religious institutions to address past injustices and support Indigenous self-determination.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) plans to propose a radical restructuring of Welsh professional rugby, reducing the number of men's professional sides from four to two. This "optimal solution" aims to transform the struggling game, with each of the two new organizations also having a women's team. The proposal includes significantly elevated funding for each men's squad, a focus on Welsh-qualified players, and centralizing national academies. This move comes after the Welsh men's side's poor performance and ongoing financial struggles within the regional system, prompting a shift towards a more sustainable model.</p>

He suggests that acting with compassion towards a diminished antagonist, even if they remain difficult, can be less stressful than active avoidance and offers a unique form of "revenge" through graciousness.</p>
