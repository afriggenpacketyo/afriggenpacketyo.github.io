          <p>The Shanghai municipal government has revealed ambitious plans to expand its shipbuilding facilities on Changxing Island, aiming to solidify China's position as the world's leading shipbuilder. The initiative focuses on producing high-tech vessels, such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are projected to constitute 80% of the base's output. The government projects the industrial cluster will achieve a scale exceeding 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years. This strategic expansion is intended to create a world-class hub for advanced marine equipment manufacturing and foster significant technological breakthroughs in the sector.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft, made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks in the Las Vegas Summer League, showcasing the skills that have made him one of the most anticipated prospects in years. Despite a self-described poor shooting performance in his first game, the 18-year-old bounced back with a 31-point effort in his second appearance. Observers note his two-way skillset, relentless work ethic, and a mature focus on winning as key attributes. While his on-court performance drew comparisons to established stars, his reserved, focused demeanor off the court also stood out during his initial professional games.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of archaeologists from the University of Houston has discovered a 4th-century royal tomb at the Caracol archaeological site in Belize, a major ancient Mayan city. The tomb is believed to belong to Te' K’ab Chaak, the founding ruler of Caracol's dynasty, making it a landmark discovery for the site. Inside, researchers found a wealth of artifacts, including pottery, carved bones, and a jadeite mosaic death mask, offering invaluable insights into the ancient culture and its long-distance trade networks. The discovery culminates over four decades of research at the site by the lead archaeologists, Arlen and Diane Chase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has for the first time utilized visual effects created by generative artificial intelligence in one of its original productions, the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that AI was used to generate a scene of a building collapsing, a process that was reportedly ten times faster and significantly cheaper than traditional methods. He argued the technology enables productions with smaller budgets to achieve advanced effects that would otherwise be unfeasible. This development comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry, where many fear AI could devalue human creativity and replace jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The space technology sector is experiencing a surge in investment, with startups raising $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a significant increase from the previous quarter. This growth is fueled by sustained interest in defense applications, improved market sentiment, and the entry of new companies like Firefly Aerospace into the public market. U.S. firms captured the majority of the funding, with year-to-date investment already surpassing the total for all of 2024. Venture capital remains the most active investor class, with a strong focus on emerging areas like in-orbit servicing and crewed space stations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop Ultra-Fast Infrared Sensor Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, which can detect faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This new technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering a significant leap in performance. Infrared sensing is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate smoke, fog, and dust to provide clear imaging. By mimicking the beetle's specialized pit organ, scientists have created an advanced optoelectronic device that could enhance China's defense capabilities by providing more accurate detection in challenging environments.</p>

          <p>Despite being engaged in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has shown remarkable resilience, reaching a record high and outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the Hamas attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) rebounded strongly, fueled by significant foreign investment and renewed investor confidence. The country's robust high-tech sector, which constitutes 20% of its GDP, is a primary driver of this economic buoyancy. Analysts credit the performance to investor perception of diminishing long-term security risks and the fundamental dynamism of the Israeli economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter (23-foot) submarine. Zhang, who had managed a riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to pursue his lifelong dream of invention. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, an engine, and a battery to construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black submarine, has now been seen navigating the local river, representing a remarkable feat of personal ingenuity and determination in a rural community.</p>
