          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, will not participate in the upcoming friendly match against Wales because of a minor ankle injury sustained during a recent Bayern Munich game. The team's management expressed hope that their record goalscorer will recover in time for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next week. In his absence, the captaincy for the Wembley match will be assigned to either Jordan Henderson, John Stones, or Declan Rice.</p>

          <p>In a major policy announcement, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch declared plans to eliminate stamp duty on the purchase of main homes in England and Northern Ireland. The proposal aims to boost home ownership and social mobility, with the party estimating the cost at £9 billion annually after 2029, funded by planned savings. This move sets a clear policy distinction from the Labour government and is part of a broader platform of new policies intended to regain political momentum.</p>

The company launched a serverless reinforcement learning service that automates computing power allocation, which it claims can train models faster and at 40% lower cost than traditional methods. This move strengthens CoreWeave's competitive position against major cloud providers and follows recent multi-billion dollar deals with OpenAI and Meta, signaling strong demand for its specialized AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, rates on savings vehicles like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are declining, prompting advice for savers to lock in current rates soon. While no longer at their peak, CD rates for shorter terms remain competitive, with many still offering returns above 4%. With further rate cuts anticipated later in the year, financial experts suggest that savers looking for guaranteed returns should consider acting now, particularly by exploring higher rates often available at online banks.

          <p>Despite gold prices recently surpassing $4,000 per ounce for the first time, some financial advisors maintain that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. While gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, its annualized total return over the past 30 years (7.96%) has lagged behind both S&P 500 stocks (10.67%) and real estate. Experts note that equities offer compounding earnings growth and dividends, which gold does not, making them a more reliable hedge against inflation over extended periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For senior homeowners on fixed incomes, a single-purpose reverse mortgage offers a targeted way to access home equity for specific, essential expenses like property taxes or critical repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state or local agencies, often to lower-income individuals, and come with lower costs and fees. While they don't provide flexible cash, they allow homeowners to cover necessary costs without incurring monthly payments, with the loan becoming due only when the owner sells, moves, or passes away.
