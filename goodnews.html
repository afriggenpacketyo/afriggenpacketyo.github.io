          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 18:42:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a significant win for the crypto industry. The act sets regulations including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and grants authority to the Treasury Secretary. The bill faced criticism, with some accusing Republicans of enabling President Trump to profit from crypto ventures. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where reconciliation with its version, STABLE, may take time, and it restricts non-financial large tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins unless they establish or partner with regulated financial entities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers in the city's Democratic mayoral primary will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' second-choice votes. This system has led to unique alliances, such as cross-endorsements between progressive candidates Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander, aimed at preventing former Governor Andrew Cuomo from winning. Results will be reported a week after the primary due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots, with preliminary totals for first-choice votes available on June 24.</p>

          <p>The musical ‚ÄúReal Women Have Curves‚Äù will conclude its Broadway run on June 29, less than two months after its official debut. Despite positive reviews, the show struggled at the box office, failing to reach expected sales figures. The musical received two Tony nominations, but the producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway. The story, adapted from Josefina L√≥pez‚Äôs play and the 2002 HBO film, centers on a teen named Ana and her garment factory worker mother in the immigrant neighborhood of Boyle Heights, and highlights themes of immigration and the American Dream.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to announce an update to its Graviton4 chip, including 600 gigabits per second of network bandwidth, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The real battle, however, is with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence infrastructure space, as AWS aims to reduce AI training costs with its Project Rainier supercomputer built for startup Anthropic. AWS has invested $8 billion into Anthropic, and the company's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, powered by over half a million of the chips, potentially shifting orders away from Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Tinder has launched a new double-dating feature, called Double Date, allowing users to create joint profiles with friends to match with other pairs, in an effort to retain Gen Z users. This feature is a refined version of the failed 2016 product Tinder Social and is designed to relieve dating stress for younger users by making it more social and fun. The feature was popular in testing with young users, especially women, and helped bring new or returning users to the platform. Tinder is facing pressure on its business, with declining subscriptions and leadership changes, and hopes this new feature will help shift perceptions and make dating feel less like work.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill to regulate crypto, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill passed with bipartisan support after weeks of negotiations that led to changes including disclosure requirements for members of Congress and Executive Branch officials, stronger bankruptcy protections, and Treasury rules for monitoring suspicious transactions. Some Democrats remain concerned that their issues were not addressed and that they were unable to amend the bill. Democratic Senator Gillibrand defended the framework as long overdue, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is "extremely unhelpful." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit, citing concerns about security stepping in. Starmer said there are strict rules about who can get close to the president and feared what the White House security team might do if anyone else tried to help. The incident occurred during discussions about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, with Starmer emphasizing the deal's importance for workers at Jaguar Land Rover. The new arrangement removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and cuts levies on cars, but negotiations over steel tariffs are ongoing.</p>
