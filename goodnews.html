          <p>Hugo Ortega, a former engineer, transformed his life by leaving his well-paying corporate job to travel and eventually become a superyacht captain, now earning up to $20,000 a month with tips. He emphasizes that prior boating experience isn't essential for entering the yachting industry, but a strong willingness to learn and a customer service-oriented personality are crucial for success. Ortega, who also appeared on Bravo's "Below Deck," now mentors aspiring yachties through his "Superyacht Sunday School," noting that while the job offers significant financial rewards and global travel, it also demands considerable time away from family and personal life. His story highlights the potential for alternative career paths and achieving financial freedom through unconventional means.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again rescheduled its Super Heavy-Starship's 10th test flight for Tuesday night, following previous scrubs due to an oxygen leak and adverse weather conditions. This critical mission aims to test significant fixes and upgrades after three prior catastrophic failures, with the long-term goal of perfecting autonomous propellant transfers essential for NASA's moon landing by 2027 and eventual Mars missions. While Elon Musk acknowledges "thousands of engineering challenges," NASA's acting administrator maintains optimism about SpaceX's rapid innovation capabilities. However, some current and former NASA engineers express strong skepticism, believing a safe, crewed moon landing by 2027 with the current complex architecture is highly improbable, highlighting the immense technical leaps still required.</p>

The tennis icon, who has bravely battled Sjogren's syndrome and painful fibroids for years, expressed profound gratitude for the opportunity to play "feeling better" after enduring significant discomfort. Her high-level play against a top opponent silenced doubters who questioned her wildcard entry, showcasing her enduring passion, skill, and competitive spirit. While she remained evasive about her future tournament plans, her emotional reflection underscored her remarkable resilience and monumental contribution to the sport despite persistent health challenges.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in tone regarding educational exchange, stating the US would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, which would more than double the current enrollment. This unexpected message came hours after the Chinese embassy in the US advised its students to exercise caution when entering America via Houston, citing recent instances of being "unjustifiably questioned and harassed." Trump emphasized his administration's intention to "get along good" with China and reiterated that President Xi Jinping had invited him to visit. This article highlights a potential softening in US-China educational and diplomatic ties, signaling a possible de-escalation of tensions despite previous rhetoric.</p>

These deals also encompass South Korean ship purchases and a shipbuilding partnership, building on a July trade agreement that lowered US tariffs on South Korean exports. President Donald Trump praised the robust economic partnership, stating, "We really sort of need each other," underscoring mutual benefits. The leaders further discussed energy cooperation and regional security, with Trump reiterating his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, known as Wegovy and Zepbound, are rapidly transforming healthcare and are projected to create a $100 billion market by 2030, with wide-ranging economic implications. Beyond obesity and diabetes, these drugs show promise for treating various conditions, potentially boosting US GDP by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings. Their impact extends to consumer spending, with users cutting grocery bills, particularly for processed snacks, and prompting food companies to adapt. The article also explores potential shifts in industries like alcohol, fashion, and travel, while raising concerns about the drugs' high cost creating a two-tier society in access.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $815 million, making it the seventh largest in the game's history, after no winning tickets were sold for Monday night's $750 million grand prize. The estimated cash value for Wednesday's drawing is $367.9 million, which could grow further as ticket sales increase closer to the drawing. This marks a continued streak without a jackpot winner since May 31, driving up public excitement and widespread participation. The odds of winning the top prize remain a challenging 1 in 292.2 million, as drawings occur three times a week across 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is continuing its path over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to weaken further, posing no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest update. The storm, which formed southeast of Bermuda, is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It was recently located about 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, moving northeast. Forecasters predict Fernand will become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating on Wednesday, assuring that it will remain over the open ocean well away from populated areas.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung successfully navigated an initial tense encounter with US President Donald Trump, employing flattery to discuss North Korea and bilateral relations during their Oval Office meeting. Despite Trump's earlier critical social media post about South Korean internal politics, Lee praised Trump's personal rapport with Kim Jong Un, asking him to act as a "peacemaker" on the Korean peninsula. While contentious trade and defense spending issues were largely sidestepped publicly, the meeting underscored the complex dynamics of the US-South Korea alliance and Trump's continued focus on personal diplomacy with Kim.

          <p>Surgeons in China have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the feasibility of xenotransplantation for lungs, despite their inherent anatomical and physiological complexities. The genetically modified pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours (nine days) without signs of hyperacute rejection or uncontrolled infection. This groundbreaking study highlights significant progress made in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, offering a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis. While substantial further tests are still required, this achievement marks a crucial step towards clinical translation in a field where heart and kidney xenotransplantation have also seen recent advancements.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled the state's Republican-controlled legislature drew congressional boundaries in violation of voters' rights, declaring the current map unlawful. The 2021 map controversially divided Salt Lake County, the state’s population center and a Democratic stronghold, among the state’s four congressional districts, leading to all four electing Republicans by wide margins. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled the legislature circumvented a commission established by voters to ensure non-partisan districts, necessitating a rapid redraw for the 2026 midterm elections. This decision creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the US House and highlights ongoing national battles over partisan gerrymandering, with potential implications for the national political landscape.</p>

The event, described as a "global cultural movement" rather than a festival, typically draws around 80,000 people to its remote location. While high winds and dust have already been observed, forecasters note that slow-moving storms could produce more rain, which might paradoxically help reduce the amount of dust lofted into the air. This article highlights the unpredictable nature of the desert environment and the need for preparedness, recalling last year's event where heavy rains caused extreme muddiness and long exit delays.</p>
