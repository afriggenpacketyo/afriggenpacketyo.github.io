          <p>Donald Trump announced that "the war is over" as he travels to Israel to oversee the release of hostages from Gaza under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Trump praised Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar for their roles, anticipating the establishment of a "board of peace" for Gaza. The ceasefire, brokered by Trump, took effect on Friday morning, with the next phases of the 20-point peace plan still under negotiation. Trump will then lead a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, where a document ending the war in the Gaza Strip is expected to be signed. </p>

          <p>Paramount, with support from Larry Ellison, is actively bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the initial offer of $20 a share being rejected by the Warner Bros. Discovery board. Paramount is reportedly preparing a second bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. movie studio. David Ellison aims to revitalize Paramount by acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, which could lead to the consolidation of CNN with CBS News. The potential merger has caused stocks of both companies to rise, but some analysts believe Paramount's offer undervalues Warner Bros. Discovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by cautiously engaging with China amidst growing tensions with the United States. Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping agreed that their differences should not turn into disputes. Modi stressed the need to "pursue strategic autonomy" and not allow bilateral relations to be "seen through a third country lens." Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as an anchor of a multipolar order and a new Asian century. </p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson was hospitalized with an orbital fracture after being struck by an elastic exercise band during pre-game warmups. The incident occurred in the locker room when equipment containing the band failed, causing it to hit Richardson's face. The Colts selected Richardson as the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, but his NFL career has been marked by inconsistency and injuries. The Colts also suffered another setback when their No. 1 cornerback, Charvarius Ward, sustained a concussion during warmups for Sunday’s game. </p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and career of Diane Keaton, who died yesterday at age 79, highlighting her unique approach to beauty and her impact on film. From a young age, Keaton understood that actual beauty required a degree of depth, originality, and fierce independence. On screen, Keaton's characters often betrayed vulnerability, leaving audiences wondering how much was performance and how much was simply her. She was a romantic who fell in love easily with the world around her and learned to see beauty in unexpected places. </p>
