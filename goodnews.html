        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 800 American jobs. The company stated that President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports accelerated the decision, making the move economically strategic. This reshoring effort aligns with the company's philosophy of producing goods in the same market where they are sold. The new U.S. factory is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding plant in China will close.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially lifted U.S. sanctions on Syria, fulfilling a promise made to the country's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The White House stated the move is intended to support Syria's path toward stability and peace. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions program, it retains targeted restrictions on former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. The administration hopes the action will encourage Syria's new government to normalize relations with its neighbors, including Israel.</p>

          <p>The historic royal train, used by British monarchs since the reign of Queen Victoria, will be taken out of service by 2027 as a cost-saving measure. The decision was announced alongside the annual royal finance report, which revealed a single two-day trip on the train cost over ¬£44,000. Buckingham Palace stated the move is part of a drive for value for money, though the Royal Family's total travel costs still rose to ¬£4.7 million for the year. The train may be put on public display after its final tour.</p>

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of various financial products. A comparison of placing $10,000 in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account reveals nuanced differences in potential earnings. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for 3- and 6-month terms, a money market account could yield more over a 9-month period. Savers must consider the guaranteed return of a CD against the variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts anticipated later this year.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a timely borrowing option this July. With interest rates on the product having decreased, HELOCs offer a flexible way to access funds where borrowers only pay interest on the amount used. As the Federal Reserve is anticipated to cut rates further later this year, opening a variable-rate HELOC now could position borrowers to benefit from lower costs in the near future, making it an attractive alternative to other forms of credit.

While many players appreciate the accuracy of the AI-powered calls, some have complained that the automated voice is too quiet and that the change removes the tradition and drama of player challenges. The move to technology, already used at other Grand Slams, marks a significant shift for the historic tournament, trading the spectacle of line judges for indisputable accuracy.</p>
