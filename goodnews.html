          <p>Chase Chrisley expressed his joy on social media after his parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, were released from prison following a pardon issued by President Donald Trump. Todd and Julie had been convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion in 2022 and were serving sentences in separate federal institutions. Chase shared a Fox News post about his parents' return to Nashville, calling it the "best birthday gift I could ask for." Todd Chrisley credited faith, family, and fitness for helping him through incarceration, and he maintained contact with his children and wife through daily communication. The Chrisleys were initially indicted in 2019 and found guilty in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks and the IRS.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks experienced a surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The merger will create a new company listed in Sydney, acquiring all outstanding shares of both entities, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. This merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium. </p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S., according to the FBI. Gao, who was attending the university in October 2024, admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. He has been federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is among few instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections, analysis suggests.</p>
