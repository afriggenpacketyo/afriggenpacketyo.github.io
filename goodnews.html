          <p>Christian singer Brandon Lake was inspired by Jelly Roll's decision to throw his phone in a river to set more boundaries in his own life. Lake, who collaborated with Jelly Roll on his new album, "King of Hearts," realized he needed to limit access to his personal life as he became more successful. Lake got a new phone and number to focus on his inner circle, emphasizing the importance of having the right people around him. Lake also discussed his mental health struggles and how living on a farm has been therapeutic for him.</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is one of several schools working to address the shortage of air traffic controllers in the U.S. by offering an accelerated training program that mirrors the FAA Academy. With the FAA facing a shortage of over 3,000 certified controllers, these programs allow students to begin medical and background checks early, potentially skipping the FAA Academy altogether and shortening the hiring process from years to weeks or months. Graduates are eager to start their FAA careers, despite the stresses of the job, and the high pay is a major draw.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to hit much of the U.S., experts are advising people to take precautions when spending time outdoors. Checking the heat index, wearing lightweight clothing, seeking shade, and staying hydrated are crucial steps to prevent heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. It is important to be aware of the symptoms of heat exhaustion and to take breaks in air-conditioned spaces, with special attention to vulnerable populations like seniors and children. The article emphasizes that extreme heat is the number one weather-related killer in the United States.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth events are being held across the country, but organizers are facing new challenges, including safety concerns and decreased corporate support. In Bend, Oregon, planners initially canceled their annual festival due to safety concerns, but another group revived it on a smaller scale indoors. West Virginia's governor eliminated Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees, while Denver's Juneteenth Music Festival was reduced to one day due to lack of funding. Despite these obstacles, organizers in Nashville and other cities are determined to celebrate the holiday, emphasizing its importance and resilience.</p>

          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan visited Hiroshima to pay respects to atomic bomb victims ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This marks their first trip to the city since the Emperor's accession in 2019. The couple laid flowers and bowed at a cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which holds the names of approximately 340,000 victims. They also visited an exhibition hall and museum, and will later listen to stories from survivors and young people involved in preserving memories of the bombing. The imperial family has a long history of commemorating the victims of the atomic bombings.</p>

This timeline, shared with foreign partners at the Paris Air Show, aligns with the "long-haul" approach taken by Boeing and Airbus in developing their first widebodies. Comac expects the C929, which will resemble the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, to be certified in China by 2032. The C929 will carry up to 440 passengers and have a maximum range of 12,000km.</p>

          <p>Japan's decision to make high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is raising alarm among educators and policy experts, who warn it could accelerate an exodus from public schools and deepen inequalities. Critics say the government has failed to pair the tuition measure with adequate support for struggling public schools, many of which are already facing shrinking enrollment and budget shortfalls. The policy is aimed at easing households' financial burdens amid inflation, but it also risks undermining the role that public high schools have long played as "safety nets" for students with diverse needs.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive Eiji Hashimoto said Thursday that the U.S. government's role set under its $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp. "will not hamper" the U.S. unit's business going forward. At a press conference in Tokyo, Hashimoto said $11 billion of investment in U.S. Steel operations -- 10 times more than the initial plan -- and a golden share issued to the U.S. government that allows it to veto key management decisions among other conditions are rational, even as analysts view them as downside risks to U.S. Steel's management. Nippon Steel remains the world's fourth-largest steelmaker through the acquisition of U.S. Steel, with their combined production volume in 2024 at 57.82 million tons, behind China Baowu Steel Group Corp., Arcelor Mittal SA and Ansteel Group Corp.

          <p>A collection of Alan Turing's papers, including correspondence with mathematician Norman Routledge, were nearly shredded before their value was realized. The papers were discovered in an attic by a cousin of Bridget Pitcher, Routledge's niece.

The collection, which dates from the 1930s and includes a copy of Turing's PhD dissertation, was eventually sold for ¬£465,400 at auction.</p>
