        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>States are using taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal Medicaid matching funds, a tactic that could face curtailment by congressional Republicans seeking federal spending reductions. The article explains how these provider taxes work, allowing states to inflate Medicaid spending on paper and collect more matching funds from the federal government. Some Republican-led states are more reliant on this strategy, and the proposed changes could significantly impact their Medicaid budgets. The article notes the federal government does not know exactly how much money states have raised with these taxes and related strategies.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled, raising concerns about where the debris might land. The spacecraft, intended for a Venus landing, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, and while most of it disintegrated years ago, the landing capsule remains in orbit. Experts predict reentry around May 10, noting the risk of impact is small but not negligible, with potential consequences for aircraft and populated areas. The article suggests that if the heat shield fails, the spacecraft will burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, but if the heat shield holds, it will reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>
