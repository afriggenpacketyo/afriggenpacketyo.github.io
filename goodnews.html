          <p>Japan is showcasing its Mogami-class multi-mission frigate, the Yahagi, in Darwin, Australia, to vie for a contract to build Australia's new-generation fleet. MSDF officials are emphasizing the frigate's stealth features and smaller crew size compared to German vessels. The Australian government is considering the Mogami-class frigate and Germany's MEKO A200 frigate to replace its Anzac-class frigates, with a decision expected by the end of the year. The Australian government is planning a major naval expansion amid growing concerns about China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 5% increase on Friday, recovering from a significant drop caused by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts attributed the initial market downturn to a Politico report suggesting Trump intended to contact Musk to resolve their conflict. However, a White House official refuted these claims, stating Trump had no interest in speaking with Musk. The disagreement stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill following the end of Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates to 20%, marking the first reduction since September 2022, indicating a decrease in inflation pressures. The central bank reduced rates by 100 basis points, from 21% held since last October. Seasonally-adjusted inflation in April was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank stated that while domestic demand growth still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, and monetary policy will remain tight to achieve a 4% inflation target.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its takeover of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures aim to ensure UBS fully capitalizes its foreign units and reduces share buybacks. The Swiss National Bank supports these measures, stating they will significantly strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of a government bailout in a crisis. These rules would also reduce UBS's holding of Additional Tier 1 bonds by around $8 billion.</p>

The author discusses the changing landscape of teen culture, noting that teenagers are increasingly creating their own content and communities online. The focus has shifted from adults being afraid *of* teens to adults being afraid *for* teens, and newly distressed about their own role in the troubles facing them.</p>

          <p>Hiring slowed in May but remained sturdy as businesses warned of uncertainty tied to President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs, exceeding economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%. Federal government employment declined due to the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut spending. Several major companies have warned of potential losses due to tariff-related uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially stated that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft after a public fallout with Donald Trump, who threatened to cancel government contracts. However, Musk later retracted the threat after pleas from users on X. NASA relies on SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. The dispute began after Musk denounced Trump‚Äôs tax and spending bill, leading to accusations of ‚Äúingratitude‚Äù from Musk and a threat to cancel contracts from Trump.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson discusses his new film, *The Phoenician Scheme*, which follows a tycoon's madcap dash across the globe to save his dwindling fortune. The director says the film, while whimsical, touches on the preening foolishness of today‚Äôs mega-rich land barons. The story follows Zsa-zsa Korda (played by Benicio del Toro) and his estranged daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton), a novitiate nun who insists on the immorality of her father‚Äôs business interests, which starve and impoverish people worldwide. The film explores themes of redemption and the relationship between fathers and daughters.</p>
