          <p>The article highlights a positive long-term outlook for Nvidia (NVDA) stock, citing the company's critical role in the expanding artificial intelligence (AI) sector. As a leading designer of semiconductor chips essential for training AI models, Nvidia is positioned to benefit from what its CEO predicts could be a $4 trillion annual AI infrastructure market by 2030. Despite its significant growth over the past decade, the stock's valuation is not considered excessively high relative to its growth prospects. The article suggests long-term investors could see strong returns from the company's continued innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethan Mbappé, the 18-year-old brother of football superstar Kylian Mbappé, is working to establish his own career after moving to Lille. Both brothers left Paris St-Germain last summer, with Kylian implying that Ethan's contract non-renewal was linked to his own decision to join Real Madrid. Praised for his football intelligence and calm demeanor, the young midfielder made his professional debut for PSG at 16. Now at Lille, he recently scored his first goal and is set to face his former club, offering a chance to prove his talent independent of his famous sibling's shadow.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though not without challenges. While the club has modernized its training facilities and achieved on-field success, including winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, it operates under strict financial regulations. Profit and Sustainability Rules have prevented the owners from spending limitlessly, forcing a more gradual build compared to previous club takeovers. The club's revenue has grown substantially, but it still lags behind top rivals, highlighting the financial hurdles that temper ambitions.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a new public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring popular social media influencers to reshape its image among younger generations. For the second year, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has funded a trip for prominent content creators to tour China and showcase its culture, scenery, and history. This "soft power" initiative aims to connect directly with Gen Z and Millennial audiences, moving beyond traditional state-led media campaigns. Experts view this as a significant and overdue shift, believing it will have a greater impact in fostering positive people-to-people ties.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir "Truly," music legend Lionel Richie reveals that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before a pivotal moment changed his path. The famously shy artist was performing with his college band, The Commodores, when a woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!" This simple acknowledgment gave him the confidence to pursue music full-time. Richie recalls contacting his priest to inform him he would not be continuing his seminary plans, realizing that his songwriting had become his true form of sermon.</p>

          <p>Germany's government has approved a "Modernization Agenda" aiming to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into public services and administration. The plan includes using AI to expedite visa processing, streamline export regulations, and reduce bureaucracy costs by 25% by 2029. This initiative is part of a broader "High-Tech Agenda" promoting key technologies to prevent Germany from falling behind globally. However, some experts and academics express concern over the government's reliance on US tech giants and whether there is sufficient scientific guidance and oversight to ensure responsible implementation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued a 14-day restraining order, ruling that the administration's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts." The judge stated that while some protest incidents were inexcusable, they did not rise to a level that local law enforcement couldn't handle. She also warned the president's actions risked blurring the line between civil and military authority.</p>
