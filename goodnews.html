Korda expressed satisfaction with her improved putting, while A Lim Kim noted her fondness for chasing the leader. Saigo recovered from an early setback on the 14th hole with four birdies in five holes, demonstrating resilience and a positive mindset throughout her round, setting the stage for an exciting weekend finish. </p>

          <p>China is modernizing its mining industry by deploying driverless electric vehicles in open-pit coal mines.

This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and aims to improve safety and efficiency.
