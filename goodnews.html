          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, to de-escalate tensions that have been escalating since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. President Trump announced the ceasefire on social media, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the U.S.'s role in brokering the agreement. Indian officials initially reported attacks by Pakistan across 26 locations, but later agreed to the ceasefire, indicating a commitment to non-escalation if reciprocated. This agreement aims to ease cross-border fire and strikes that have caused civilian casualties on both sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the collapsing birth rates around the world and argues that this demographic crisis should be a concern for progressives. The author contends that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the quality of life, strain the economy, and potentially harm the environment. Dismissing pronatalism as solely a right-wing issue is a mistake, the article suggests, and progressives should engage in policies that support people in having children if they desire, such as affordable housing, universal pre-K, and better healthcare. Ignoring this issue, the author warns, cedes critical ground to those with less inclusive politics.</p>

          <p>This article details the story of the Langenhop family, whose three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare immune disorder. The article outlines their journey through a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. The therapy, led by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA, essentially allowed a patient to be their own stem cell donor. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well, and the therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region lifted an order that had confined approximately 160,000 people to their homes after a fire at an industrial estate in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The fire, which broke out at a swimming pool cleaning products firm, prompted officials to urge residents to stay indoors while firefighters monitored the toxic levels. While the fire was stabilized and no casualties were reported, the incident highlights the potential dangers of industrial accidents and the importance of emergency response measures.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Is Germany's AfD Not Right-Wing Extremist?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article fact-checks claims by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) that the German domestic intelligence agency has withdrawn its classification of the party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The BfV complied with the AfD's request to follow a so-called "standstill commitment" (Stillhaltezusage). This means that the agency is putting its official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. The article clarifies that the classification was not withdrawn, and the agency is only pausing the designation to allow the court time to review the case. The article concludes that the AfD's interpretation of the "standstill" order as a partial success is misleading.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, made an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket booster failure. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War-era space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious space exploration programs of the past and the challenges of interplanetary travel. Despite the failure of its primary mission, the Kosmos-482's re-entry highlights the legacy of the Soviet Venera program, which achieved several firsts in the exploration of Venus.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have refuted her involvement in a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, dismissing it as a ploy for "tabloid clickbait." Swift was summoned to court after allegations arose that she encouraged Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively for the film *It Ends With Us*, which is at the center of a sexual harassment case. Swift's representatives stated that she had no involvement in casting or creative decisions and never reviewed or made notes on the film. The legal battle involves counter-suits between Lively and Baldoni, with accusations of sexual harassment, extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), introduced by Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar, aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances in the United States. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funding for research of Schedule I substances. While opinions differ on its likelihood of passage, supporters say the bill would prioritize evidence over ideology, allowing policymakers to study the effects of cannabis legalization and inform future legislation. The EBDPA would also permit research on other Schedule I substances, such as psilocybin and MDMA, which may have therapeutic potential.</p>
