          <h2>Trump Mandates Classical and Traditional Architecture for Federal Buildings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 08:09:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order, 'MAKING FEDERAL ARCHITECTURE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN,' mandating traditional and classical styles as the preferred aesthetic for federal buildings. This directive aims to ensure public structures uplift and beautify spaces, inspire the human spirit, and command respect, while also being visually identifiable as civic buildings. The order, which echoes a similar mandate from his first term that was later rescinded by President Biden, establishes a strong preference, particularly for classical architecture in Washington D.C., though it does not outright prohibit alternative styles in appropriate circumstances. Beyond aesthetics, the order also emphasizes practical considerations such as economical construction, the use of dependable materials, and ensuring accessibility for the handicapped.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer visited Taipei, with Senator Wicker, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, declaring Taiwan a "free country" with the "right to remain free." This visit comes as President Trump seeks a trade deal with China, which views Taiwan as its territory and opposes any official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges. China's Foreign Ministry condemned the visit as a violation of the "one-China" principle, reiterating its stance that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The American senators emphasized a commitment to long-term friendship and enhanced military cooperation, aiming to reassure Taiwan amidst growing jitters about U.S. support and increased Chinese military pressure.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has unveiled his latest squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia, featuring several significant changes. Notably, Trent Alexander-Arnold, the Real Madrid right-back, has been dropped from the team, having also recently been benched by his club. In a move signaling fresh talent, uncapped players Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest and Djed Spence from Tottenham have received their first senior call-ups. The squad also sees the return of Marcus Rashford and Adam Wharton, while experienced players like Kyle Walker and striker Ivan Toney were not included. These selections reflect Tuchel's ongoing evaluation and strategy as England aims to maintain its top position in Group K.</p>

          <p>Yanni Gentsch, a 30-year-old German jogger, gained viral attention after confronting a cyclist who was secretly filming her backside in a park. Her video, showing the voyeur's excuses and victim-blaming, resonated widely, leading to her powerful slogan: "My clothes are no invitation!" Despite her determination, Gentsch learned that German law only criminalizes filming private parts, not clothed body parts for sexual purposes. In response, she launched a petition, "Make voyeuristic recordings a crime," which has garnered over 125,000 signatures and sparked a national conversation. Justice ministers in Germany are now expected to discuss an amendment to the Criminal Code to address this legal loophole.</p>

This significant return to European competition for Forest follows their seventh-place finish in the Premier League last season, and subsequent promotion to the Europa League after Crystal Palace was penalized for breaching multi-club ownership rules. Other notable draws include Aston Villa facing Feyenoord, Fenerbahce, and Bologna, while Scottish giants Celtic and Rangers will both contend with Roma.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris topped the first practice session at the Dutch Grand Prix, signaling a strong start for McLaren as the Formula 1 season resumes after its summer break. Norris recorded the fastest time, finishing 0.292 seconds ahead of his teammate Oscar Piastri, and appeared to have a consistent advantage during their race-simulation runs on soft tires. This performance is crucial as Norris trails Piastri by nine points in the championship with ten races remaining. Aston Martin also showed promising pace, with Lance Stroll securing an impressive third-fastest time, narrowly beating his teammate Fernando Alonso. The session offers an initial glimpse into the competitive landscape for the weekend's events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is set to offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting January next year, a significant public health initiative. The vaccine will be administered as two doses, at 12 and 18 months of age, in combination with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up campaign planned for slightly older children. This program aims not only to protect youngsters from the severe, though rare, complications of chickenpox but also to alleviate the estimated £24 million annual loss in income and productivity caused by parents needing to take time off work for sick children. Health experts, advised by the JCVI, anticipate that widespread vaccination will dramatically reduce overall chickenpox cases and the incidence of more serious outcomes.</p>

          <p>Alibaba posted better-than-expected net income in its June quarter, primarily fueled by accelerated sales within its cloud computing unit and a continued revival of its e-commerce business, even as overall revenue fell short of analyst forecasts. The cloud division was a significant bright spot, with revenue increasing 26% year-on-year, and AI-related product revenue now forming a substantial portion of external customer revenue, underscoring Alibaba's strategic focus on artificial intelligence. While its core e-commerce business saw revenue growth, adjusted earnings in this segment decreased due to intensive investments in the highly competitive "instant commerce" space, offering rapid deliveries. Despite broader economic uncertainties in China, investors have rewarded Alibaba with a more than 40% rally in its U.S.-listed stock this year.</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated stronger-than-expected growth, expanding at an impressive annual rate of 7.8% in the quarter that concluded in June. This figure significantly surpassed the 6.7% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, highlighting a robust economic performance. The positive momentum was largely driven by strong contributions from the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, indicating broad-based recovery and expansion. This growth rate also marks an acceleration from the 7.4% recorded in the preceding quarter. Both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund project India's economy to grow between 6.3% and 6.4% for the fiscal year 2026, reinforcing its status as a leading global economic engine.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin and World Liberty Financial, is expanding the Trump family's crypto empire into Asia, predicting Bitcoin will reach a $1 million valuation within several years. Speaking at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, he highlighted his deep involvement in the crypto space, which he claims now occupies 90% of his time. This Asian tour, which will also include appearances in Japan and South Korea with Donald Trump Jr., comes as President Trump has embraced the crypto industry, branding himself the "crypto president." However, a Hong Kong official and lawmaker withdrew from the conference following advice not to engage with Eric Trump, reflecting the political sensitivities surrounding the family's business ventures amidst global trade tensions.</p>

Her niece, Jean Driggers, expressed immense relief, stating, "she’s finally going to be where she belongs." Investigators initially struggled to confirm her identity amidst the post-Katrina chaos, but a fresh look at cold cases, utility bills, and a unique necklace inscription ultimately led to the positive identification, bringing the number of unidentified victims at the memorial down to 29.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of what they claim is the world's first "universal" 6G chip, boasting data transmission speeds 5,000 times faster than typical rural U.S. internet connections. This significant breakthrough, led by scientists from Peking University and City University of Hong Kong, could revolutionize connectivity by enabling the transfer of a 50GB high-definition 8K movie within mere seconds. The chip's "universal" capability aims to unify the currently fragmented spectrum of frequencies utilized by various 5G mobile phones, satellites, and future high-frequency applications, potentially rendering existing piecemeal solutions obsolete. This technological leap promises to unlock a vast array of commercial and educational opportunities, particularly benefiting remote areas with enhanced connectivity.</p>

          <p>Nearly 1,000 "worker over billionaire" protests are scheduled across all 50 U.S. states for Labor Day week, orchestrated by the AFL-CIO and dozens of partner advocacy groups. These extensive grassroots actions, encompassing marches and rallies in major cities and smaller towns, are designed to oppose the Trump administration's policies, which unions argue undermine workers' rights and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Key policy grievances include attempts to revoke collective bargaining rights for one million federal workers, reductions in minimum wage requirements for federal contractors, and proposed eliminations of federal minimum wage and overtime protections for 3.7 million care workers. Organizers aim to channel strong public trust in labor unions to mobilize a fight for freedom, fairness, and security for all working people against perceived authoritarian shifts.</p>

          <p>Illinois has launched IL Pride Connect, a pioneering legal hotline designed to provide free, affirming legal support and resources for the LGBTQ+ community. This initiative, spearheaded by Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, emerges amidst increased hostility and federal rollbacks targeting LGBTQ+ rights under the Trump administration, including the recent shutdown of a specialized youth suicide lifeline and cuts to health funding. The hotline offers assistance with crucial tasks such as accessing healthcare, changing name and gender markers on documents, and provides advocacy tools, aiming to counter "ignorance with information and cruelty with compassion." Supported by both state and philanthropic funding, this program positions Illinois as the sole state offering such comprehensive services, ensuring its LGBTQ+ residents have access to vital legal and community support.</p>
