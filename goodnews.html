          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark revealed on social media that she was fined $200 by the league for a comment she made on Instagram celebrating the Indiana Fever's playoff victory. The comment, which stated "refs couldn't stop us," was posted on a fan account's screenshot and quickly drew the league's attention. This incident adds to the ongoing contentious relationship between Clark and WNBA officials, a recurring theme where Clark, her teammates, and coach have previously voiced frustrations over what they perceive as unfair or inadequate officiating. Her teammate Sophie Cunningham even jokingly suggested starting a fundraiser to pay the fine.</p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes marked his 200th game for the club with a milestone 100th goal, inspiring his team to a 2-1 victory against Chelsea. His performance was highlighted not just by the goal but by his relentless effort and leadership, which manager Ruben Amorim praised as crucial to the squad's morale. Despite some criticism of his temperament and tactical discipline in a deeper midfield role this season, Fernandes's importance to the team remains undeniable. Amorim stated that the Portuguese midfielder deserves a significant place in the club's history for his contributions.</p>

          <p>As Baltimore begins to receive funds from opioid-related lawsuits that could exceed $500 million, the city is pledging transparency in how the money is spent to combat the addiction crisis. City officials are developing a public dashboard to track expenditures and outcomes in real-time, aiming to avoid the pitfalls of past settlements where funds were diverted or ineffectively used. The city is considering evidence-based harm reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption sites, which have shown success in other locations. This financial influx provides a critical opportunity to invest in new and expanded programs for a city long-ravaged by drug addiction.</p>

          <h2>UK Liberal Democrats Aim to Reclaim Patriotism from the Far Right</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats are making a concerted effort to reclaim patriotism as a core party value at their conference in Bournemouth, aiming to counter its association with the far right. In a theatrical opening rally, former leader Tim Farron draped himself in a flag and urged members to stop being "squeamish" and wave the UK's flags with pride. This new strategy is a notable departure for the party, which has traditionally shied away from overt displays of national pride. The move is seen as a direct challenge to groups like Reform UK, as the Lib Dems seek to present themselves as the true patriots.</p>

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) in Norco are appealing to the state's attorney general to reverse the decision to close the prison by 2026. They argue that the facility could help alleviate the severe overcrowding in county jails, a problem that prompted a lawsuit by the attorney general against Los Angeles County. The officers contend that the state's rationale for closure, which includes high infrastructure costs and an aging facility, is flawed. They assert that the prison is cost-effective and has available space, making it a viable solution to the state's correctional system challenges.</p>

          <h2>Social Psychologist Identifies Disrespect as a Key Red Flag in Romantic Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 14:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a critical red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant actions, such as devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a fundamental ingredient for a thriving relationship, as people enter partnerships to be seen and valued. She advises addressing these behaviors through direct conversation to determine if change is possible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new executive powers to prevent U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, a move that would have impacted nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights obtained by the government as part of the national-security agreement for the company's $14.1 billion acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. The agreement gives the White House veto power over major strategic decisions, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly informed U.S. Steel's CEO that the administration would not permit the closure, forcing the company to reverse its decision.
