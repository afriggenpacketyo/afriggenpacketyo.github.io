          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing generative AI to create real-time language translation devices, moving the concept from science fiction to reality. Apple is promoting "Live Translation" as a key feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate several languages instantly for the user. Similarly, Google's Pixel phones will feature "Voice Translate," which preserves a speaker's vocal inflections, while Meta is integrating translation capabilities into its smart glasses. This emerging tech battleground could reshape industries, particularly for professional translators.</p>

          <p>Forty-eight years after anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko died in police custody, South African prosecutors have announced they will reopen a formal inquest into his death. Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, died from a brain hemorrhage, which his family has long maintained was the result of torture by apartheid-era police. Despite initial claims of a hunger strike, no one has ever been held accountable for his death, and officers involved were denied amnesty. The decision reflects renewed pressure to prosecute apartheid-era crimes and correct the historical record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and fixed incomes, many seniors are seeking ways to tap into their substantial home equity without taking on new monthly debt. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home's value, with the loan repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. Another method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides upfront cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation. These tools can provide liquidity but require careful consideration of long-term trade-offs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are preparing to compete in the next phase of the weight-loss drug market with the expected launch of oral medications in the U.S. next year. These daily pills could expand access to GLP-1 treatments, which are currently dominated by weekly injections like Wegovy and Zepbound. While Lilly's injectable offers higher weight loss, the company is confident its pill, orforglipron, will compete well due to easier manufacturing and fewer dietary restrictions. Analysts predict oral drugs could capture a significant portion of the projected $80 billion market.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a postponement of the new iPhone Air's release in China due to regulatory issues related to its eSIM-only design. The device, which lacks a physical SIM card slot, requires a special government license for wireless carriers to sell, an approval that has not yet been secured. The iPhone Air represents the first major redesign since 2017, and CEO Tim Cook explained that the eSIM technology was crucial for accommodating a larger battery. The company stated it is actively working with Chinese carriers to make the phone available as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>With inflation rising again, Americans with significant credit card debt face a challenging economic landscape, making relief options like debt forgiveness more appealing. The persistence of high interest rates means that waiting for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts is unlikely to provide substantial relief for borrowers. Given the unpredictability of future monetary policy, this article suggests borrowers should proactively explore various debt relief solutions now, including debt settlement, credit counseling, and consolidation loans. It emphasizes that taking action is more effective than passively hoping for a more favorable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club outlined its rationale for planning to trim its position in custom AI chipmaker Broadcom following a substantial increase in the stock's value. With the holding now exceeding 5% of the club's portfolio, the strategy is to lock in profits and rebalance the position to manage risk. The decision comes as Mizuho raised its price target for the stock, citing strong potential for AI-related revenue growth from both existing and new clients like OpenAI. The discussion highlights a disciplined investment approach of taking profits after a significant run-up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching a new pilot program aimed at speeding up the safe rollout of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Key industry players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are participating in the program, which will establish public-private partnerships to facilitate supervised trials, potentially starting as early as next year. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy hailed the initiative as the next great revolution in aviation. Both companies praised the program as a critical step toward commercial air taxi services.</p>

          <h2>New Novels Explore the Existential Feeling of Panic Attacks Through a Literary Lens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 11:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews two new novels, Michael Clune's "Pan" and Lee Lai's graphic novel "Cannon," which both provide raw depictions of what a panic attack feels like. Clune's book follows a teenager researching the Greek god Pan to understand his debilitating anxiety, while Lai's work uses the metaphor of menacing magpies to visualize the protagonist's building stress. Both books attempt to communicate the overwhelming physical and existential sensations of panic, moving beyond clinical descriptions to capture the lived experience. The review highlights how literature can offer a cathartic and insightful exploration of mental health.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is purchasing more shares of Boeing, viewing the recent stock dip as a buying opportunity. The share price fell after the CEO acknowledged delays in the certification process for the 777X aircraft. However, the investment club's thesis remains that such delays are not uncommon and do not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory, which is the primary driver of the stock's value. The club maintains confidence in the company's turnaround under its current leadership and its improved balance sheet following a recent equity raise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norway, has decided to exclude French mining company Eramet from its portfolio. The decision is based on an "unacceptable risk" that the company is contributing to severe environmental damage and human rights violations at its nickel mining operation in Indonesia. The fund's ethics council cited deforestation, loss of critical habitats, and threats to the survival of an uncontacted indigenous tribe as key reasons for the divestment. Eramet stated it "deeply regretted" the decision and was committed to responsible mining practices. (not investment advice)</p>
