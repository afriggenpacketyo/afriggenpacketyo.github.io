          <h2>Supreme Court Rules Family Can Sue Over Wrong-House Raid by FBI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 11:37:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a Georgia family whose home was wrongly raided by the FBI, allowing their case to proceed under an exception to law enforcement immunity. The decision enables the family to sue for damages resulting from the mistaken raid. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion. This ruling sets a precedent for similar cases and clarifies the limits of law enforcement immunity, providing recourse for individuals whose rights are violated during such incidents. This decision is a win for justice.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education had planned for the Treasury Department to take over management of the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, according to recent court documents. The agreement involved transferring nine Education Dept. employees to the Treasury to discuss collections activities. These plans are now on hold after a U.S. District Judge blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Education Department. Experts suggest the Treasury talks indicate the Trump administration's desire to reduce the role of the Education Department in managing student loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused significant inflation, with recent data showing benign consumer and producer prices. Three factors have kept inflation in check: companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the time lag for tariffs to affect the real economy, and limited pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Economists expect the impact of tariffs to materialize in the coming months. The article analyzes the short-term economic impacts of tariffs and their potential future effects on inflation.

The airline has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be taken directly from the card used to make the booking.

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with a teenage girl with epilepsy in a unanimous ruling that could make it easier for families to sue over access to education. The girl's family argued that her school district did not provide adequate accommodations for her learning needs. Lower courts had previously ruled against the family's discrimination claims, but the Supreme Court's decision lowers the legal standard required for such lawsuits. This ruling has significant implications for disability rights and access to education. This is a positive step forward.</p>
