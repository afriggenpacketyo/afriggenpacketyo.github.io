          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers concluded their preseason with a sloppy 30-23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, prompting questions about their final 53-man roster. Linebacker Marlowe Wax delivered a standout performance with a strip sack and crucial tackles, potentially securing his spot. Conversely, rookie returner Luke Grimm had a challenging game, muffing two punts, though he did catch a late touchdown. The article highlights the mixed performances of backups, with numerous penalties and inconsistent play, as the team prepares for roster cuts by Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, starring in the film adaptation of Richard Osman's best-selling 'Thursday Murder Club' series, expressed a "huge responsibility" towards the books' millions of fans. Brosnan portrays Ron, an amateur sleuth, alongside Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Ben Kingsley. Directed by Chris Columbus and involving Steven Spielberg's production company, the film has received mixed critical reviews, with some praising its charm and others criticizing its narrative flimsiness. The movie will have a limited cinematic release before streaming on Netflix, a decision Dame Helen Mirren found disappointing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a disappointing 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, managing only two hits, which resulted in them falling out of first place in the NL West. Padres starter Nestor Cortes unexpectedly dominated, pitching six scoreless innings and retiring his first 16 batters. Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow struggled in the fourth inning, yielding three crucial runs. This second consecutive loss to the Padres reverses the Dodgers' two-game division lead from earlier in the week, putting San Diego in a strong position for a series sweep. The article highlights the Padres' bullpen and revamped lineup as key factors in their recent success.</p>

          <p>A subsidiary of Taiwanese laptop maker Asus is constructing a new supercomputer aimed at significantly boosting Taiwan's computing capacity. The initial phase of this infrastructure, a collaboration between Taiwan AI Cloud and the National Centre for High-Performance Computing, is set to launch in December with an 80 petaflop capacity. Located in Tainan, the supercomputer is projected to reach a total capacity of 250 petaflops, increasing the island's overall computing power by at least 50%.
