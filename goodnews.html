          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. His legal team, led by Patrick Fitzgerald, intends to challenge the lawfulness of the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the U.S. Attorney who presented the case to the grand jury. Comey's attorneys also plan to file motions alleging grand jury abuse and outrageous government conduct, arguing that the prosecution is vindictive and selective. The judge set a trial date for January 5, expressing a desire for a speedy resolution, while Comey maintains his innocence and anticipates a trial to prove it. Optimism for Comey is at a reasonable score.</p>

          <p>Former captain Steven Gerrard and other players from England's so-called 'Golden Generation' reflect on their failure to achieve major tournament success, citing issues such as club rivalries, egotism, and tactical shortcomings. Despite boasting a squad of highly talented players, England consistently underperformed on the international stage. Tactical inflexibility and the inability to integrate players from rival clubs contributed to their lack of cohesion as a team. While other nations also possessed great players, England struggled to overcome internal divisions and injury problems, ultimately falling short of expectations.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges in Virginia, in a case pursued by the Trump administration. The charges include making a false statement and obstruction of a congressional proceeding during his 2020 Senate committee testimony. Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, has asserted that the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. Attorney, was unlawful, and plans to file motions addressing grand jury abuse and government misconduct. The trial is set to begin on January 5, with the defense arguing that the case is simple and does not involve complex or classified information.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, announced that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes in England and Northern Ireland. The move aims to help millions achieve home ownership and unlock a fairer, more aspirational society. Badenoch stated that the party would fund this promise through £47 billion in planned savings from cuts to the welfare budget, foreign aid, and the Civil Service. The announcement was part of a broader policy blitz aimed at setting clear dividing lines with political opponents.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) deal with OpenAI, which involves AMD offering 10% of itself to OpenAI. Huang described the deal as "imaginative" and "clever," but questioned the decision to give away a significant portion of the company before its next-generation product is fully developed. The agreement commits OpenAI to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips over multiple years, and OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's latest funding round.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, delivered a keynote speech at the party conference, unveiling a series of policy announcements aimed at grabbing political attention and setting clear dividing lines with opponents. The key announcement was the abolition of stamp duty on main homes in England and Northern Ireland, intended to reclaim the mantle of economic responsibility. The Conservatives plan to fund this through £47 billion in proposed savings. The speech sought to emphasize Badenoch's new leadership and the party's commitment to making bold decisions, hoping to buy time and attention amid dire opinion poll ratings.</p>

          <p>Recent claims on social media suggest that Generation Z is leading a church revival in the United States, citing a study by the Barna Group. However, a DW Fact check reveals that these claims misinterpret the study's findings. While the study notes a slight increase in church attendance among Gen Z churchgoers compared to other age groups, it does not indicate an overall resurgence in faith. Other research, including a Pew Research Center survey, shows that older Americans are still more likely to participate in religious services monthly when considering the entire U.S. population.</p>

The grenades will be destroyed at a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks a dedicated destruction facility for this type of object.</p>

The Housing Authority will limit residents to those below 50% of the area median income, and the properties will be rented out to voucher recipients for at least the first five years.
