          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily ease tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, signaling a significant de-escalation in trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The agreement involves a substantial reduction in reciprocal tariffs, with both sides moving to lower their tariff levels by 115%. This move aims to provide room for ongoing negotiations and address concerns related to their economic and trade relationship. However, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports related to fentanyl will remain in place, indicating a continued focus on specific trade issues.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for individuals on the county's convicted animal abuser registry to own pets. This expanded legislation, signed by County Executive Ed Romaine, aims to protect animals by imposing penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine for violators. The law builds upon a 2010 initiative that established an animal abuse registry, enhancing the county's efforts to combat animal abuse and neglect. The new law addresses a previous loophole by providing consequences for offenders who disregard the ban on pet ownership.</p>

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump's administration is preparing to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked criticism, raising questions about bribery and corruption. There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers, but the constitution's emoluments clause bans government office holders from accepting gifts from any "king, prince, or foreign state" without congressional approval. Foreign leaders use gifts to strengthen relationships and break the diplomatic ice.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy challenged Russia's President Vladimir Putin to meet him personally in Turkey on Thursday for ceasefire talks, following a weekend of proposals from both sides. Zelenskyy expressed hope for a ceasefire with Russia starting Monday, contingent on Ukraine accepting Russia's offer to hold direct talks in Turkey. This move comes after President Trump insisted Ukraine accept Russia's latest offer.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple after a lengthy legal battle. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. The return ends a dispute that contributed to bilateral friction. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers highlight the government's toughened migration rules, requiring English tests and restricting care home recruitment. The papers also focus on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's willingness to hold direct negotiations with Putin after US pressure. Additionally, research suggests weight-loss jabs may cut cancer risk, and a heatwave is expected in Britain.</p>
