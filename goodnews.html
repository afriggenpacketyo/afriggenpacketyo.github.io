          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has officially announced his campaign for a third term, releasing a video that highlights his administration's accomplishments. He cited seven consecutive balanced budgets, multiple state credit upgrades, and legislative victories such as raising the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. Pritzker positioned himself as a problem-solver in stark contrast to the Trump administration, while also addressing speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run by stating his current focus remains on governing Illinois.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to make significant concessions on its planned welfare reforms to avert a large-scale rebellion from Labour backbenchers. According to sources, the deal would protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from proposed cuts. This move represents a substantial climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat on its flagship bill aimed at saving ¬£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits.</p>

The movie introduces a new military-grade android, AMELIA, to face off against the titular antiheroine, M3GAN. While the plot is described as derivative and assembled from other sci-fi classics, the review praises the film's self-aware humor and its entertaining, if not particularly scary, commentary on humanity's relationship with technology.
