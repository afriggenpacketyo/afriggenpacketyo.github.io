          <p>The inaugural summit between leaders of ASEAN, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and China in Kuala Lumpur signals a historic convergence of three economic powerhouses representing over 2 billion people and a combined economy of nearly US$25 trillion. The summit emphasized deeper cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure, and finance, with a focus on green energy, digital transformation, connectivity, and sustainable agriculture. This partnership aligns with China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative, leveraging ASEAN‚Äôs consumer markets, the GCC‚Äôs energy wealth, and China‚Äôs manufacturing prowess. The collective ambition is to foster regional stability and economic globalization, with the potential for trade expansion and reduced reliance on the US market.</p>

          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London have been disrupted due to damage to overhead electric lines caused by a fallen tree in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, affecting services until 14:00. Some services scheduled to start in Glasgow are now starting in Preston, Lancashire, experiencing delays of several hours, while ticket holders can travel on alternative services or get a refund. Network Rail Scotland is working to repair the lines and aims to reopen the line by 11:30, while the Aberdeen to Inverness railway line is also closed due to a fallen tree.</p>

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in Havering-atte-Bower, east London, are being kept indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground. The bird, nicknamed Brenda, is believed to be guarding its nest and has reportedly swooped on residents in the village. Havering Council has provided advice to the school, including legal deterrents and hiring a falconry expert, but intervention options are limited as buzzards are a protected species. The school is educating children about the buzzard, integrating it into art, stories, and other projects, while a bird of prey expert visited with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle to teach the children about birds of prey.</p>

          <p>Borussia Dortmund is confident of signing Sunderland midfielder Jobe Bellingham, despite major interest from clubs across Europe. The German club believes they are in pole position to secure Bellingham's signature, as he wants to follow in his brother Jude's footsteps by joining them. Dortmund has not yet opened talks with Sunderland but believes an agreement will eventually be reached. The club's bargaining position has been strengthened by a strong end to the season, securing a place in next season's Champions League.</p>

          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Red Bull ordered Max Verstappen to give up his fourth-place position after an incident with George Russell in Turn One. The stewards later determined that Russell had momentarily lost control and collided with Verstappen, who did not deliberately leave the track, leading to no further action. Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, admitted that the decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake. Horner stated that they should have left him out on his soft tires, but they went with the information they had at hand.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that the majority of his philanthropic Gates Foundation's $200 billion endowment will be spent in Africa over the next two decades, urging African leaders to boost health and development through partnership and innovation. Gates highlighted the importance of investing in primary healthcare and singled out Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as examples of countries showing strong leadership. This pledge comes amid halts to US foreign aid and concerns about the potential impact on programs like PEPFAR, which delivers HIV and AIDS relief abroad. The Gates Foundation has heavily invested in projects aimed at reducing childhood and maternal deaths, advancing vaccines, and lifting poor populations out of poverty.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will build new nuclear-powered attack submarines, prepare its army for war in Europe, and become "a battle-ready, armor-clad nation," according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This boost to military spending is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer stating that Britain "cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses." The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons, investing in innovation, and establishing a cyber command to counter Russia-linked attacks. The government aims to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea, and in cyberspace.</p>
