          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, its most advanced AI model, making it accessible to all ChatGPT users, including those on the free tier. The company states the new model is significantly faster, more accurate, and less prone to fabricating answers, a phenomenon known as hallucination. New capabilities include "vibe coding," where users can generate software from simple text prompts, and "safe completions" for handling potentially risky queries. The rollout aims to reach an estimated 700 million weekly active users and is being integrated into partner products like Microsoft 365 Copilot.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a historic peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House. The deal, attended by both nations' leaders, aims to resolve decades of conflict and includes Armenian development rights for a new transit corridor named the "Trump Route." U.S. officials have worked for months on the pact, which is seen as a crucial step for deepening regional ties and potentially expanding the Abraham Accords. The agreement will also open new energy and trade routes to the West that bypass both Russia and Iran.</p>

          <p>Shares of rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace soared in its Nasdaq debut, opening at $70 per share, more than 50% above its initial public offering price of $45. The strong opening values the company at nearly $10 billion, reflecting growing investor interest in the space technology sector. Firefly, which recently won a $177 million NASA contract and successfully landed its Blue Ghost lander on the moon, has a backlog of approximately $1.1 billion. The successful IPO follows other strong tech debuts this year, signaling a potential warming of the market for new public offerings.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, the latest version of its AI chatbot, which CEO Sam Altman claims possesses "PhD-level" expertise in various fields. The company promotes the new model as being smarter, faster, and less prone to making up answers than its predecessors. However, the launch is also being met with some skepticism, as an AI ethics professor suggests the hype may be driven by marketing and the need to maintain investor confidence. A BBC correspondent who gained early access noted the experience felt more like an evolution than a revolution, highlighting the ongoing debate about the true advancement of these AI systems.</p>

          <p>United Arab Emirates President Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, signaling a significant strengthening of the strategic partnership between the two nations. The leaders pledged to double their bilateral trade, which reached $11.5 billion, within the next five years. This visit highlights the UAE's strategy of maintaining a diversified foreign policy, balancing its relationships with the U.S., Russia, and China. Despite being a key U.S. ally, the UAE has not participated in Western sanctions against Russia and has become a crucial economic partner and safe haven for Russian businesses.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight in a late-stage trial, a result that paves the way for market entry but fell slightly below some Wall Street expectations. The company's shares dropped following the news, while rival Novo Nordisk's stock rose. While some doctors praised the result as a significant and clinically meaningful outcome for an oral agent, others noted the discontinuation rate due to side effects like nausea and vomiting. Eli Lilly's CEO stated the results were on thesis, creating a convenient, mass-market pill with competitive weight loss.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi, making him the new front-runner. Waller's odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his willingness to adjust monetary policy based on forecasting rather than only current data. Waller, a Trump appointee, recently dissented on the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the approach was "overly cautious." His perceived dovish stance and political independence have made him a preferred choice for some investors over other potential candidates like Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett.

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would be a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has long advocated for access to the trillions of dollars held in defined contribution plans. While these assets have been available to pension funds, they were traditionally excluded from 401(k)s due to higher fees, risk, and lack of transparency. The order signals a major shift in retirement investment policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's executive order to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s, this article explores how investors can gain exposure to the asset class, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Crypto ETFs, which have seen record inflows this year, offer a convenient way to invest without directly holding digital currencies. The piece distinguishes between standard ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT, which track the token's price, and more aggressive leveraged funds designed for short-term trading. While some advisors advocate for significant crypto allocation in portfolios, others caution that the risks associated with volatility remain a major concern for long-term retirement planning.

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threat to impose 100% "secondary tariffs" on countries that purchase Russian energy exports if a ceasefire in Ukraine is not reached. After Trump targeted India with a lower-than-threatened 25% tariff, oil prices actually declined, suggesting traders believe the president is bluffing or that a deal will be reached. Analysts note that steep tariffs would disrupt global supply and cause prices to soar, undermining Trump's goal of lowering energy costs. The market's muted reaction indicates a belief that the administration will avoid actions that could trigger a significant price spike at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

The company now expects full-year revenue to be between $1.01 billion and $1.02 billion, a notable increase from its previous projection.

          <h2>The Importance of Politeness in an Increasingly Uncivil Digital World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 12:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay argues that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by anonymous online interactions and communication with AI, is detrimental to personal well-being. The author defines politeness as a key component of personality and notes that being rude, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can increase one's own anger and depression. Conversely, practicing courtesy, even when it feels undeserved, is shown to elevate mood and happiness. The author suggests making politeness a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity as practical ways to improve personal happiness and counteract a broader cultural trend toward incivility.</p>
