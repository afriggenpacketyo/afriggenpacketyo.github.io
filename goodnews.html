          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist, was released from ICE custody in Louisiana following a judge's order, after being detained for over three months. Khalil expressed gratitude and concern for those still detained, criticizing the Trump administration's policies.

          <p>Grow a Garden, a gardening simulation game on Roblox, has gained immense popularity, surpassing even adrenaline-filled games like Fortnite in concurrent players. The game involves players cultivating virtual land, buying seeds, and selling harvests, with the ability to steal from other players' gardens. The slow-paced nature of the game appeals to many, especially children, who enjoy the patience and competitive elements. While some find the premise puzzling, others are drawn to the virtual produce and the possibility of obtaining rare items, some of which are sold for high prices on eBay.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer approaches, the question of whether shorts are appropriate in the office remains a contentious topic. While some companies have relaxed dress codes, allowing employees to dress comfortably, wearing shorts is still a "grey area." Stylists suggest that context is key, and shorts may not be suitable for client-facing roles. Companies like Accenture and British American Tobacco expect staff to dress professionally but comfortably, while Santander advises against beachwear. The type of shorts also matters, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than beach, sports, or denim shorts.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center around President Trump's demand for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to give Trump a win by securing commitments to increase defense spending. The summit will be shorter than usual, reportedly due to Trump's preferences, and discussions will be limited to avoid divisions. While some European nations are already boosting their defense spending, many will struggle to meet the new target, and there are concerns about creative accounting to meet the requirements.</p>
