          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is nearing a potential move to Barcelona after an agreement in principle was reached for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford has reportedly favored a move to the Spanish club since falling out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. The transfer would be financially beneficial for Manchester United, as it would free up his significant wages, allowing the club to pursue other signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for the English player.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they be held next week. The proposal aims to increase the momentum of negotiations and work towards achieving a ceasefire in the ongoing war. This diplomatic overture comes amidst continued conflict, as Zelenskyy also reported that Russia had launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in recent overnight attacks. The article also notes other developments, including the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from Georgia and Australia's delivery of tanks to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open, calling the approach inconsistent. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson and DeChambeau pointed out the discrepancy between the long playing times allowed in the first two rounds and the sudden strictness in the third. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness and transparency.</p>

          <p>An article from The Guardian explores the efforts of Generation Life, a group of young, religious activists advocating for chastity until marriage. The feature follows them as they engage with beachgoers on the Jersey Shore, a location synonymous with hedonism. Rather than focusing on abstinence, the activists frame chastity as a countercultural movement against the superficiality of social media and hookup culture, emphasizing seeing people for their inherent worth. The article delves into whether this message can resonate with a generation that is having less sex but is also increasingly secular and skeptical of traditional norms.</p>

Galloway, a self-made millionaire, emphasizes that enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities were key to his own success. The article suggests that a more practical approach is to identify personal strengths and apply them to fields that offer financial stability.</p>
