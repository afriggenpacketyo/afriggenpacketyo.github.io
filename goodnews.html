        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns over approaching tariff deadlines, this article argues that several positive factors are currently bolstering the stock market. These include strong corporate earnings, various tax relief measures in President Trump's proposed economic bill, and significant business investment in R&D and construction. The analysis also points to massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, increased bank lending capacity, and a resurgence in the U.S. energy sector as reasons for optimism. These elements could fuel an economic boom, counteracting negative pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ projects that the technology will cross a critical "usefulness" threshold within the next five years, becoming more broadly applicable. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and larger industrial-grade systems, which it has sold to over 50 countries. SpinQ's CEO, Xiang Jingen, tempers this optimism by comparing the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, indicating that significant development is still required before it becomes mainstream.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry will be held into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham, resulting in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent criminal case against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address "unanswered questions" and examine both the events of the day and their aftermath.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 families argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article explains that dismissing a child's feelings with phrases like "you're okay" can erode their self-trust over time, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, allow for age-appropriate choices, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence that protects long-term mental health.</p>
