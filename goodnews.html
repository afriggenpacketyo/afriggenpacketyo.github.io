          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, reducing their magic number to clinch the National League West to one. The win was significantly aided by two scoreless innings of relief from pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw, who stepped in after the bullpen faltered late in the game. Sasaki, returning from injury, showed promising form, while Kershaw made his first relief appearance since 2019. The team is now looking to their starters for crucial late-game relief as they push towards the postseason.</p>

          <p>London's leading bank executives are urging the UK government for greater policy clarity and stability, expressing concerns over potential tax increases in the upcoming Autumn Budget on November 26. CEOs from Barclays, Citi, and J.P. Morgan highlighted the importance of a consistent approach to bank regulation and taxation to maintain London's competitiveness as a global financial center. They warned that excessive taxation could stifle investment and growth within the financial services sector, which contributes significantly to Britain's tax income. Amid a £62 billion budgetary deficit, the industry seeks assurances that the government will prioritize long-term economic growth.</p>

This deal is part of Hengrui's strategy to leverage international partnerships to globalize its independently developed drugs.

Following a meeting with Zelensky, Lula expressed his perception that both leaders recognize the limits of negotiation, despite not being ready to state their concessions publicly. He emphasized the necessity for the United Nations to lead a contact group for negotiations, a proposal he previously made to the UN Secretary-General. This push comes as Brazil and China continue to advocate for their six-point peace plan, aiming to build international support for a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely climbed on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's declines as investors continued to sell off tech stocks like Nvidia and Oracle for a second consecutive day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a modest gain, with Chinese automaker Chery Automobile debuting 11% higher after its $1.2 billion IPO. South Korea's Kospi was near flat, but defense stocks rose, while Taiwan's Taiex dipped. US stock futures remained stable as investors awaited jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve monetary policy amidst concerns about a weakening labor market. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all experienced declines overnight.</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, saw its shares surge 11% above its IPO price in its Hong Kong debut, raising $1.2 billion. The company is accelerating its global expansion, with plans to launch three combustion-engine SUVs in Poland by November and having already introduced its Chery and Omoda brands in the UK. Despite global headwinds like 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs in the US and Canada, and EU tariffs up to 45.3%, Chery's local manufacturing in the Middle East and Southeast Asia helps mitigate some risks. The strong debut highlights the brand's growing international presence beyond China.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. US District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, mostly Democratic, that argued the policy was an unconstitutional attempt to coerce "sanctuary" states. The decision is a setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE. The judge deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious," stating that withholding critical disaster funds would cause irreparable harm and impact public safety. The Department of Homeland Security stated it plans to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's monumental $100 billion investment in OpenAI will largely be channeled into leasing Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for OpenAI's AI supercomputing facilities. The agreement, spanning several years, allows OpenAI to spread its significant compute costs over time rather than making upfront purchases, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. This arrangement is crucial for OpenAI, a non-investment-grade startup, to fund its ambitious data center expansion, including the first gigawatt facility expected by late 2026. The deal also helps OpenAI secure better terms for additional debt financing, addressing the critical shortage of AI computing capacity.</p>

          <p>Africa is rapidly expanding its solar energy capacity, driven by a record influx of Chinese-made solar panels, according to an Oxford Economics study. In the first seven months of this year, the continent imported 9,516 megawatts worth of panels, a significant increase from the previous year. South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria are leading this surge, largely due to major energy plants developed by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's 342MW De Aar Central Solar Power Plant in South Africa. This trend underscores China's dominance in global solar technology production and its crucial role in Africa's renewable energy future.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts cranberry farmers are increasingly participating in a state program that pays them to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands, driven by falling cranberry prices and rising operational costs. This initiative, part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program, aims to revert land to its natural state, fostering native plant growth and providing ecological benefits like water filtration and storm resilience. Over 500 acres have been restored in the past 15 years, with another 500 planned. The program offers a sustainable option for farmers facing economic headwinds, ensuring their land's preservation for environmental and public enjoyment.</p>

          <p>A Northern California jewelry store, Heller Jewelers in San Ramon, successfully used advanced security measures to thwart a large-scale robbery attempt by 20-25 masked suspects. The bandits, armed with crowbars and handguns, smashed display cases to steal an estimated $1 million in merchandise. However, the store's security door activated, momentarily trapping the mob and forcing them to shoot their way out before fleeing. Police pursued the suspects using helicopters and drones, leading to the arrest of seven individuals ranging from 17 to 31 years old. This incident marks the second robbery at Heller Jewelers since 2023, highlighting the store's proactive security upgrades.</p>
