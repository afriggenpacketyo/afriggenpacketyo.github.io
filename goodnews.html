          <p>Welsh rugby international Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to rugby union. After 18 months in the United States, which included time on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, the 24-year-old stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. Rees-Zammit had retired from rugby in January 2024 to join the NFL's International Player Pathway Program. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national team, which recently ended a long losing streak.</p>

          <p>Nintendo's fiscal first-quarter revenue has more than doubled year-over-year, largely propelled by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units. The company's video game platform business saw sales surge by 142.5%, attributed to the new hardware's higher price point. Despite the strong quarterly results that surpassed analyst expectations, Nintendo has maintained its conservative financial guidance for the full fiscal year. The company's stock has rallied significantly this year on excitement for the new console, even as it navigates potential impacts from U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has officially reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the country's Atlantic region, citing significant population growth. Authorities have documented 209 wolf packs and approximately 1,600 individual animals, primarily in northern Germany, a notable recovery since the species was considered in "unfavorable" condition in 2019. This new status may lead the government to authorize wolf hunting in the region to manage the population. The development has drawn criticism from farmers' associations, who advocate for more urgent measures to protect livestock from the predators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation within Whitehall and ensure the government better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering" that tells some young people they are not welcome.</p>

The 23-year-old, who has faced significant injury setbacks in recent years, recently ran a personal best that makes him the third-fastest British man in history. After fearing his early promise was fading, Burgin now feels he is back on the trajectory he showed as a record-breaking junior athlete. He is focused on securing a spot on the team at the UK Athletics Championships and is gunning for a medal in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A new law banning the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords has come into effect in the UK, named in memory of a teenager who was killed with such a weapon. 'Ronan's Law' is the result of a campaign by Pooja Kanda, whose 16-year-old son, Ronan, was fatally stabbed in 2022 in a case of mistaken identity. The teenagers convicted of his murder had easily purchased the weapon online. The law also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders and conduct age-verification checks, aiming to curb youth violence and the availability of dangerous weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in South Africa have launched an innovative anti-poaching initiative called the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. This procedure makes the horns detectable by radiation monitors at international borders and airports, aiming to deter poachers and traffickers. The project, a collaboration between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists, has confirmed the process is safe for the animals. With South Africa's rhino population under severe threat, this method offers a new technological tool to disrupt the illegal horn trade and protect the declining species.</p>

          <p>The focus of international space exploration appears to be shifting from lunar missions to the more ambitious goal of landing humans on Mars. While NASA's Artemis program continues to plan for a sustained human presence on the Moon, it is increasingly framed as a "stepping stone" for future missions to the red planet. Both U.S. leadership and private entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are vocal about colonizing Mars, with China and the European Space Agency also setting long-term targets for Martian exploration. This trend may see national agencies prioritize Mars, leaving lunar projects increasingly to the commercial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Kuwait's deputy minister of defence called the project a "milestone" in cooperation between the two nations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, and examines why the Trump administration has employed them as a key policy tool. President Trump argues that tariffs protect American jobs and manufacturing by making foreign goods more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestic products. However, the policy has been criticized for creating global economic uncertainty and leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers as companies pass on the costs. The administration has used tariffs as a negotiating tactic to secure trade deals and to pressure countries on other issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. This ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been legally living and working in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were preordained and potentially motivated by racial animus. The decision postpones the planned expiration of their legal status and deportation protections until at least November.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's handling of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. He argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock, it inevitably leads to more legal challenges that require the court's intervention. Addressing criticism about a lack of transparency, Kavanaugh stated the court has been writing more to explain its reasoning in these emergency cases. He described the court's internal collegiality as strong, even amidst disagreement on contentious and high-profile legal issues.</p>
