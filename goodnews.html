          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains for weeks, recounted her survival story after being found in a cabin. Slaton said she became trapped by an avalanche and later immobilized after a fall, forcing her to subsist on wild leeks and melted snow. She attempted to call 911 multiple times without success, but used her GPS to guide her toward the nearest Starbucks, which she described as a 'long, arduous journey.' After losing her tent and sleeping bags, she relied on her foraging skills, a lighter, and a knife until she was found by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who fled to eastern Congo following the 1994 Rwandan genocide, were repatriated on Saturday with assistance from the U.N. refugee agency. The refugees, mostly women and children, crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR. Rwandan authorities said that over 101,000 refugees have been repatriated already, including 1,500 since the beginning of 2025, with returnees receiving support for reintegration into Rwandan society.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine faces an urgent need for more soldiers, the military is increasing efforts to recruit women, but sexism remains a significant obstacle. Lieutenant Kateryna is the only female combat pilot in the Ukrainian military, serving at a forward helicopter base with dozens of male pilots. Despite the challenges, she has flown over 30 combat missions and encourages other women to pursue aviation careers. While the government passed a law allowing women to serve in combat roles in 2018, deeply rooted stereotypes persist, leading to marginalization and underutilization of women in the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, driven by a changing global landscape and the Trump administration's shifting policies. A summit in London is expected to yield a defense and security agreement to bolster European military security, alongside relaxed trade rules and deepened energy cooperation. While challenges remain, the overarching theme is adapting to a world where the United States is less engaged, prompting Britain and the EU to address shared problems collaboratively. However, pro-Brexit voices in the UK media criticize any moves towards closer ties with the EU.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Gyroscope Promises More Stable Navigation for Aircraft and Ships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 00:00:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a new fiber-optic gyroscope designed to provide more stable navigation across a broad temperature range. This gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a potential improvement for inertial navigation systems in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Unlike traditional gyroscopes that use moving mechanical components, fiber-optic gyroscopes rely on the movement of light in optical fibers, providing immunity to interference and making them valuable for military and security applications.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers say they have developed a ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù fibre-optic gyroscope that is stable across a large temperature range and can be used for navigation. According to the team from the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, the gyroscope could offer a more stable way to measure navigation for aircraft, ships and oil rigs. Gyroscopes are devices that can sense orientation and the rate at which a moving object is turning, so they play an important role in inertial navigation systems.</p>

          <p>The high demand for live shows in China, including concerts and music festivals, is fueling a surge in tourism spending. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel stays, dining options, and tourist attractions to encourage greater consumption. For example, Shily Zhou, a Shanghai resident, traveled to Chengdu to see a concert and received a discount to visit the Taoist mountain Qingchengshan. This trend reflects Beijing's focus on boosting domestic consumption amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to a quarter-mile in Chicago and created hazardous driving conditions. The region's exceptionally dry soil contributed to the intensity of the storm, reminiscent of dust storms during the Dust Bowl era. Meteorologists noted that this was the first time a dust storm warning had been issued for Chicago.</p>

In 2024, Scheffler won eight times, but has only one victory so far this season after a freak hand injury at Christmas delayed his season, making this tournament a major opportunity for him.</p>
