          <p>The Seattle Seahawks achieved a dramatic 23-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night, extending their winning streak against the NFC West rivals to eight games. Kicker Jason Myers secured the win with a decisive 52-yard field goal as time expired, overcoming an earlier missed attempt. Despite blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead to a rallying Kyler Murray, the Seahawks capitalized on a critical kickoff penalty to set up their final scoring drive. Quarterback Sam Darnold had an efficient outing, complemented by a strong running game and six sacks from the defense, ensuring a hard-fought triumph.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly stated his readiness to step down from office once the war with Russia ends, asserting that his main goal is to achieve peace, not to pursue another term. In an interview, he also confirmed that Ukraine would be open to holding elections during a ceasefire, regardless of its duration. Zelenskyy's original five-year term, which began in 2019, was extended due to martial law imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, preventing elections. His remarks underscore a commitment to restoring normalcy and democratic processes in Ukraine post-conflict.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has publicly acknowledged that his party, and the broader left, previously avoided addressing public concerns about illegal immigration. Writing in the Telegraph, Starmer outlined Labour's commitment to tackling "every aspect of the problem," particularly in response to the growing electoral challenge posed by Reform UK. He is expected to announce a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as a key component of his party's strategy. While defending Labour's current approach, Starmer also laid blame on the Conservative government's past failures and called for a rejection of Reform's "toxic" solutions for national renewal.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, asserts that artificial intelligence is in the nascent stages of a "super cycle" that could endure for 15 to 20 years, profoundly reshaping global industries. He highlights three major shifts: Silicon Valley's resurgence, the empowerment of sole founders through AI, and a pivot towards "deep" tech beyond consumer-facing companies. Ganguly believes the next decade will focus on AI's impact on less-tech-driven sectors like healthcare and climate. While acknowledging a "frothy" market due to over-optimistic short-term expectations, he sees significant long-term profit opportunities in AI-native applications, particularly those emerging from India.

This engineering marvel soars 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below, matching the height of mainland China’s tallest skyscraper, the Shanghai Tower, and surpassing the previous record holder. Crossing the dramatic Huajiang Grand Canyon, often called the “Earth’s crack,” the bridge will also claim the title of the longest mountain bridge globally, with a total length of 2,890 meters. Its inauguration highlights China's advanced capabilities in complex infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged the firm illegally used nearly half a million pirated books to train its chatbots. The settlement, which will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per covered book, does not apply to future works. While the judge acknowledged the complexity of distribution, he deemed it a fair agreement. The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers hailed the settlement as a significant victory, signaling to AI developers that infringing on intellectual property rights carries a substantial cost and will push companies towards legal licensing.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has declared he will not allow Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a statement made prior to Netanyahu's UN General Assembly address. This firm stance emerges amid increasing global pressure on Israel to conclude the Gaza war and occupation, with a recent wave of Western nations formally recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Trump also expressed optimism that a Gaza deal was "pretty close" after engaging with Netanyahu and other Middle Eastern leaders. Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, addressing the UN remotely, thanked recognizing countries and asserted Hamas would have no governing role.</p>

          <p>A California Senate bill, inspired by an 8-month-old baby repeatedly woken by loud commercials, aims to regulate streaming service ad volumes, potentially impacting platforms nationwide. Senate Bill 576, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, seeks to extend federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act protections, currently only applicable to traditional TV broadcasters, to streaming services. Due to California's significant market influence, a state-level law could compel streamers to adopt a uniform national policy. The bill, which passed the state Senate unanimously, faces opposition from the Motion Picture Association, arguing against the feasibility of controlling varied ad sources.</p>

          <p>The UK has inaugurated its first stem cell collection center solely dedicated to transplants, located at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, a development poised to significantly boost life-saving donations. Operated by the Anthony Nolan charity in collaboration with the NIHR Nottingham Clinical Research Facility, this new facility will generate 1,300 additional donation slots annually, directly tackling a long-standing global scarcity of cell collection infrastructure. This expansion is vital, given that previous capacity constraints meant only a fraction of registered donors could donate when urgently required. The center promises to enhance timely access to transplants for patients battling blood cancers and disorders.</p>

          <p>US country music megastar Luke Combs has observed a distinct appreciation for country music among British fans, noting their engagement differs significantly from American audiences. As country music rapidly expands in the UK, Combs, performing at the Royal Albert Hall for the Grand Ole Opry's historic first international show, finds British listeners more focused on entire albums and lyrical content. He contrasts this with the typically louder, more boisterous atmosphere of his U.S. concerts. Combs attributes the genre's global surge to its universal appeal and the accessibility provided by streaming services, highlighting a unique and growing international fan base.</p>

The coral, protected under endangered species acts, was in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without intervention. Aquarium experts describe their facility as a "coral hospital," where staff have nursed many pieces back to health, with some now on public display. This rescue highlights the severe impact of illegal wildlife trade and the aquarium's role in conservation and public education as "ambassadors for their species."</p>

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel has caused alarm in a California town, attacking multiple residents and resulting in at least two emergency room visits for bites and scratches. The incidents in San Rafael's Lucas Valley neighborhood prompted a local humane society to confirm the unusual behavior. One 80-year-old victim recounted a startling encounter where the squirrel jumped onto her leg. Experts suggest such rare aggression stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, which leads animals to lose their natural fear and potentially become aggressive when expecting food. Residents are now being cautioned against feeding wildlife to prevent future attacks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is considering converting business jets into aerial refueling tankers as part of its Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) initiative. This wide-ranging exploration aims to address evolving anti-air threats and replace aging fleets like the KC-135s. Business jet-based tankers could offer benefits like lower operating costs, shorter runway requirements, and increased flexibility for routine missions, freeing larger tankers for demanding operations. While they would have less fuel capacity, they could support dispersed operations and potentially offer multi-role capabilities. The Air Force is also refining cost estimates for stealthy tanker designs, emphasizing survivability in contested environments.</p>

Yang, who helped draft previous five-year plans, emphasized that weak consumer demand is fundamentally an income issue.
