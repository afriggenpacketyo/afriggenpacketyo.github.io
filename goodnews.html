          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 00:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits that surpassed expectations, driven by significant growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, up from $1.91 billion in the same period last year, with earnings per share up 19%. CEO Bill Winters noted that the earnings do not fully reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs, and while trade tariffs have increased global economic complexity, the bank remains confident in improving returns. Standard Chartered is also implementing a cost-saving initiative aimed at saving $1.5 billion over three years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 00:04:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to an extremely close margin, with only four votes separating Reform UK and Labour. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Early results showed Labour holding the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties, but with significantly reduced vote shares as Reform came in a close second. Reform is also targeting councils such as Kent and Lincolnshire, and believes it could make gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, following Hurricane Helene, which left debris covering waterways. The survey aims to determine the hurricane's impact on the sport fish population by comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Biologists are examining fish for defects, injuries, and parasites to assess the health of the ecosystem. The findings will help understand how the debris has affected the fish population, which is vital for the area's tourism industry.</p>
