          <p>South Korea's Kospi stock index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, propelled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade talks with the U.S., despite broader losses in other Asia-Pacific markets. The index briefly touched an intraday high of 3,794.87 before stabilizing near the flatline. This localized positive sentiment contrasts sharply with declines seen in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Japan's Nikkei 225, which tracked Wall Street's banking sector fears. The article highlights that while other markets faced headwinds, including a major BYD recall in China, South Korea's non-oil domestic exports also saw a sharp rebound in September, further signaling underlying economic resilience.

          <p>AC Milan's 17-year-old striker, Francesco Camarda, is rapidly emerging as a prodigious talent, breaking several records in Italian football and sparking hopes he could be Italy's next great forward. He became the youngest player to score a Serie A goal for Lecce while on loan and the youngest to debut in Serie A for AC Milan, requiring a special exemption due to his age. Camarda also recently became the youngest Italian to score for the Under-21 national team, displaying exceptional composure and ruthlessness. Experts praise his innate scoring instinct and leadership, with his boyhood club Milan securing him on a contract until 2028 despite interest from other major European teams.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney expressed strong doubts about Marcus Rashford's assertion that an "inconsistent environment" at the club contributed to his fluctuating performance. Rashford, who enjoyed a prolific 30-goal season in 2022-23 but later fell out of favor, made the claim while now flourishing on loan at Barcelona. Rooney contended that a player's individual application and effort are paramount, stating that the ability to perform, including running more, is not dictated by the team's environment. The article emphasizes Rooney's perspective that blaming the environment can be an "easy one to throw at people" when personal performance is lacking.</p>

          <h2>EU Leaders Press for Swift Action on Frozen Russian Assets to Aid Ukraine</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>EU heads of state are poised to demand quicker action on utilizing immobilized Russian assets to finance Ukraine, as revealed in a document obtained by CNBC. This initiative is spurred by growing pressure from the U.S. and its G-7 allies to seize billions in frozen Russian funds. Although European nations have already channeled profits from these assets to Kyiv, concerns over potential legal and financial repercussions have hindered more aggressive steps. The draft document calls for concrete proposals on using cash balances and stresses the importance of equitable burden-sharing among G7 partners, particularly in light of reduced U.S. financial and military support for Ukraine.

          <p>Former members of the UK military will soon be able to download a digital version of their identity cards, an initiative ministers hope will serve as a "case study" for a planned nationwide digital ID scheme. Approximately 1.8 million veterans are eligible for this optional digital ID, designed to simplify access to public services such as GP and mental health support, housing, careers advice, and various discounts. Digital government minister Ian Murray emphasized its potential to address privacy and security concerns for the broader UK-wide scheme, which is slated to be mandatory for employment by 2029. This development marks a significant step towards modernizing public services and enhancing accessibility for veterans.</p>

          <p>The article explores the fading social taboo around discussing bodily functions, exemplified by comedian Alan Carr openly addressing his sweating on "The Celebrity Traitors." This cultural shift is further evidenced by other celebrities, like Chrissy Teigen and Adele, who have publicly shared their experiences with perspiration, and the rise of "sweat suits" and brands like Sweaty Betty. It highlights trends such as saunas becoming professional networking spaces and the beauty industry embracing a "sweaty hot girl" aesthetic. While this normalization is seen by some as a positive step towards body positivity, critics argue it can also be a marketing strategy. The article also touches on hyperhidrosis, a medical condition causing excessive sweating, and its increasing public awareness.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel declined to lift a lower court's order blocking President Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois, citing a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment. The court found insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or an inability to execute laws with regular forces, rejecting the administration's claims that troops were needed for crime prevention in Chicago or to protect federal immigration facilities. The article emphasizes the court's clear stance that "political opposition is not rebellion" and that protest activity has not significantly impeded federal law enforcement. This decision reinforces the balance of power between federal and state authorities.</p>
