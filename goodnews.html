          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, transforming the event into a large-scale protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The significant turnout was reportedly fueled by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law. Instead of being suppressed, the event became a celebration of human rights and solidarity, with Budapest's mayor and attendees sending a clear message of defiance against what they see as hateful policies.</p>
