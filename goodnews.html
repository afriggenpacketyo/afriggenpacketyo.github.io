          <p>Two young brothers, a 10-year-old and a toddler, who vanished from their Los Angeles foster home early Thursday morning, have been safely located. The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed their recovery on Sunday, stating both children were in good health, bringing significant relief after an Amber Alert was issued due to concerns for their imminent danger. Police had suspected they were taken by their biological mother, Jackeline Hernandez-Torres, following reports from foster parents who heard a door opening around 1:30 a.m. The successful resolution highlights the critical role of community vigilance and coordinated law enforcement efforts in ensuring child safety.</p>

          <p>Selena Gomez's fiancé, music producer Benny Blanco, sparked considerable online outrage after a TikTok video featured him boasting about a $200 box of exceptionally large blueberries. Blanco's casual display and description of the "f---ing huge" fruit as a "meal" drew sharp criticism from followers, who highlighted the stark contrast with their own financial struggles. Many commenters expressed that $200 represents weeks of groceries for their families, with some even referencing global suffering. This incident occurred as Blanco and Gomez, who recently became engaged, are reportedly postponing their wedding plans due to demanding professional schedules.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished figure who spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director on Broadway before transitioning to a prominent acting career in his 60s, has died at 96. He was widely recognized for his roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler's extensive behind-the-scenes work included 53 Broadway productions, such as the original "My Fair Lady." He embraced acting later in life, consistently working for over 30 years and publishing a memoir last year, embodying his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

This postponement follows three previous catastrophic in-flight failures and aims to test significant upgrades and stress the vehicle's capabilities. The mission planned for the Super Heavy booster to splashdown in the Gulf and the Starship to deploy Starlink simulator satellites and perform an in-space engine restart before an Indian Ocean splashdown. These tests are crucial for Elon Musk's Mars ambitions and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, which relies on Starship for astronaut transport by 2027, a timeline many observers deem unrealistic given the development challenges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling offense experienced a significant revitalization in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, ending a two-game slide and re-establishing a first-place tie in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts had urged his team to improve their at-bats and maintain a team-first approach, without abandoning their inherent slugging ability. The resurgence was highlighted by Dalton Rushing's decisive three-run home run and Freddie Freeman's two long balls, which powered a crucial five-run seventh inning. This nine-hit, four-walk outburst showcased the team's renewed discipline and power, turning the tide after a prolonged offensive funk.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway with the vehicle's standard Level 1 cable, not due to safety concerns but because the "electrical chords running along the ground" were considered unsightly. The HOA referenced National Electrical Code (NEC) 625, but experts and online commenters quickly clarified that NEC 625 does not prohibit standard Level 1 charging when equipment is used as intended. This incident underscores the prevalent perception of HOAs' micromanagement tendencies and prompts questions about their interpretative authority over regulations, often prioritizing aesthetic uniformity over practical homeowner requirements and rights.</p>

Raleigh's impressive display also included his ninth multi-home run game of the season, setting a new major league record for switch-hitters. The first-time All-Star, who signed a significant $105 million contract extension earlier this year, is now on track to become the first American League catcher to lead the majors outright in home runs.

          <p>Manchester United's new £200 million attacking lineup, featuring recent acquisitions Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is encountering early goal-scoring difficulties despite substantial summer investment. After two Premier League matches, the team has managed only one goal, an own goal, and notably missed a crucial penalty against Fulham. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledges these "teething problems" as new players integrate and adapt to a different tactical approach. While the team is generating numerous chances, their current inability to convert them into goals is a growing concern, particularly following last season's worst league goal return since 1973-74.</p>
