          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its streaming and theme park divisions. The company's direct-to-consumer streaming business saw continued subscriber growth, adding 1.8 million to Disney+, and is expected to generate significant operating income. While the experiences segment, including parks and cruises, saw an 8% revenue increase, the traditional linear TV business continued to decline, and the theatrical unit suffered from poor box office results compared to the previous year.

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism and strengthen diplomatic ties, South Korea will implement a temporary visa waiver for Chinese tour groups. The program will run from September 29 of this year until June 30 of the next, allowing organized groups to enter without a visa. This policy follows a similar unilateral move by Beijing, which granted visa-free entry to South Koreans. Officials hope the initiative will revitalize regional economies and increase domestic consumption as the inbound tourism market continues to recover.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle has publicly voiced his frustration over the NFL's new ban on smelling salts and ammonia inhalants. The league issued a memo prohibiting the use of these substances before and during games, citing an FDA warning and the potential to mask neurological symptoms, including concussions. Kittle, a regular user of the stimulants for an energy boost, jokingly commented that he "considered retirement" upon hearing the news. He is one of many players likely affected by the new directive aimed at enhancing player safety.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by a significant rebound in its U.S. market. The company's domestic same-store sales grew by 2.5%, reversing two consecutive quarters of decline, a success attributed to popular promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and new menu items. Overall global same-store sales jumped 3.8%, with strong performance also seen in international markets such as Japan, China, and the United Kingdom, indicating robust global demand.

          <p>The UK government and the British Medical Association (BMA) have agreed to restart negotiations to resolve the long-running dispute over pay and working conditions for resident doctors in England. The agreement for a "window for negotiations" follows a recent five-day strike and means no further industrial action will be called for the time being. While previous talks focused on non-pay issues, the BMA maintains that any resolution must address pay, arguing that real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008 despite recent increases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent blog post, Nvidia's chief security officer, David Reber Jr., firmly denied that the company's chips contain any hidden vulnerabilities. He stated unequivocally that there are "no back doors," "no kill switches," and "no spyware" embedded in their graphics processing units (GPUs). The post emphasized that intentionally creating such vulnerabilities would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors. This public assertion aims to reinforce the security and trustworthiness of Nvidia's technology, which is critical infrastructure across numerous industries, including AI, finance, and healthcare.</p>

          <p>A new FBI report for 2024 indicates a significant nationwide decrease in crime, contradicting claims of a "crime wave" made during the presidential election. The data shows a 4.5% drop in overall violent crime, with murders falling by 14.5% to levels not seen since the 1960s. Reported sexual assaults and robberies also declined. While the report notes a concerning rise in assaults on law enforcement officers, the overall trend shows the nation was safer in the final year of the Biden administration than in the preceding years.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a poster for BrewDog's Wingman beer, ruling that it irresponsibly implied alcohol could solve problems like boredom, loneliness, or frustration. The ad featured text describing frustrating scenarios like a friend being late and positioned the beer as a reliable "Wingman" that "always got your back." While BrewDog argued the ad was about reliable quality, the ASA concluded it breached the code by suggesting alcohol could overcome personal problems. This is not the first time the company's advertising has been censured by the watchdog.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that football clubs in crisis, such as Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe, can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Her comments come as a new law establishing an independent football regulator is set to be implemented, granting it powers to oversee clubs in England's top five divisions. Nandy emphasized that the regulator will introduce stronger tests for owners and could even force sales in dire circumstances. She stressed the importance of these clubs to their communities and vowed to prevent collapses like that of Bury FC in 2019.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China will waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes subsidies for children in private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and reduce the financial burden on families. While parents will still be responsible for other costs like meals, Beijing hopes the measure will help address demographic challenges. The central government will share the funding burden with local governments to offset the lost revenue for schools.</p>
