        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Simon, Walmart's former U.S. CEO, believes the retailer is strong enough to absorb tariff costs without raising prices, contradicting the company's 'doom and gloom' commentary. Simon points to Walmart's increased gross profit margin and price deflation in general merchandise categories as evidence of its ability to manage tariff impacts. He suggests that corporate executives' negative commentary could erode consumer confidence, especially given a steady job market and cheaper fuel prices. Simon is currently on the Darden Restaurants board and is the chairman at Hanesbrands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old boy named KJ has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment for CPS1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder affecting one in 1.3 million babies. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to fix KJ's specific mutation, potentially preventing severe mental and developmental delays, and a possible liver transplant. The treatment, which involves pinpoint targeting using CRISPR technology, offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare and could eventually be used for more common genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. The treatment's rapid development was possible through federal funding for basic research and collaboration between multiple institutions.</p>

          <p>World's top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler voiced his disagreement with the PGA of America's decision not to implement 'lift, clean, place' rule for the first round of the PGA Championship, citing unfair conditions due to rain-soaked course. Scheffler argued that hitting the ball in the fairway should not result in punishment due to mud on the ball, which significantly impacts control and distance. He acknowledged the purist perspective but emphasized the importance of a fair test of golf, where skill is not compromised by chance. Despite the setback, Scheffler finished the day 2-under par, while Ryan Gerard led the leaderboard.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are considering a new security pact to enhance cooperation on defense, economic security, infrastructure, energy, migration, and transnational crime, marking a potential shift in relations post-Brexit. This initiative, spearheaded by the Labour government, aims to establish regular interactions with the EU, including a summit on May 19 to launch a new partnership. While proponents argue it will complement NATO and boost the UK economy by allowing access to EU defense funding, critics fear it could undermine British sovereignty and constrain its military structure. The agreement also explores a 'veterinary' deal to ease border checks on food and drink, though this raises concerns about aligning with EU regulations and oversight.</p>

          <p>A Grocery Outlet store in Hemet, California, is enforcing a new policy requiring customers to leave large personal shopping bags with the cashier due to an increase in retail theft. The owners, Matthew and Allison Whitlow, announced the policy on Facebook, stating that customers can use store-provided hand baskets instead. The policy aims to prevent theft and maintain affordable pricing for the community. Customers are allowed to carry their smartphones and wallets while shopping, and the owners encourage those struggling financially to ask for help.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) committee is moving forward with a $9.4 billion budget for the 2026 fiscal year, despite facing a projected $2.3 billion deficit through 2030 and uncertainty over federal funding. The budget includes over $390 million for public safety, addressing resident concerns about violence on buses and in stations. While the budget allocates significant funds to transit operations, rail and bus expansion, and infrastructure projects, the absence of a requested $2 billion in state funding raises concerns about potential service cuts. The state budget proposal includes $17.6 million from the highway fund toward Olympics and Paralympics planning, but critical funding for bus leases remains unconfirmed.</p>

His music has been recorded by artists ranging from Frank Sinatra to Jay-Z, whose 'Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)' sampled the song from 'Annie.' Strouse initially aimed to be a composer of concert music, studying under Nadia Boulanger, but found success in musical theater after collaborating with lyricist Lee Adams.</p>

          <p>New federal requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. F.D.A. officials are seeking more clinical data before approving Novavax's Covid vaccine. Concerns have also been raised about Covid's impact on children, possibly leading to an end to the vaccine's use in that age group. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine confidence in all vaccines.</p>
