          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax on major U.S. technology companies, prompting the resumption of trade negotiations with the United States. The decision came after President Trump threatened to suspend talks over the proposed 3% levy, which would have retroactively affected firms like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, both leaders agreed to continue discussions toward a new economic and security relationship. The move is seen by some analysts as a concession to appease the White House and big tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to reaffirm his country's support for Ukraine amidst its ongoing war with Russia. Wadephul emphasized that Germany will continue to stand firmly with Ukraine, providing modern air defense, weapons, and economic aid. The visit highlights Germany's role as a key European backer for Kyiv, particularly as Europe seeks to compensate for wavering commitment from the United States. Wadephul condemned Russia's actions, stating President Putin aims to subjugate Ukraine at any cost.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky has been released from prison after five years, much of which was spent in solitary confinement. Tikhanovsky, who was jailed after attempting to run against authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in 2020, was freed along with other political prisoners following a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. He described the severe conditions of his imprisonment but affirmed that his spirit is not broken and that he remains dedicated to the fight for a democratic Belarus. His release is seen as a diplomatic gesture by Lukashenko to re-engage with the West.</p>

          <p>China has announced a conditional and partial lifting of its blanket ban on Japanese seafood, which was imposed in 2023 following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The new measure allows for the resumption of imports of aquatic products from most of Japan. However, the prohibition will remain in effect for ten prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations, which were strained by the initial comprehensive ban.</p>

          <p>Following China's partial lifting of a ban on Japanese seafood, the Japanese government has announced it will strongly urge Beijing to remove the remaining restrictions. While China has resumed imports from most of Japan, a ban is still in place for products originating from ten prefectures, including the Fukushima and Tokyo regions. Japan's diplomatic push aims to achieve a full restoration of the seafood trade that was halted in response to the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. This represents the next step in resolving the ongoing trade and diplomatic friction between the two nations.</p>
