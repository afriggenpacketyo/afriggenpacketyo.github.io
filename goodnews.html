        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The implementation of the UK's Online Safety Act, which requires age verification for sites with adult content, has led to a dramatic increase in VPN usage. Virtual Private Network applications now dominate the top download charts on Apple's App Store in the UK, with one provider reporting an 1800% spike in sign-ups. This suggests many users are circumventing the new age checks over privacy concerns related to submitting personal data. Cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services carry significant security and privacy risks, potentially exposing user data.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Cambridge University have found a rare and remarkably complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact. The print was pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a ceramic model of a building placed in tombs, likely by the craftsperson who made it between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. Egyptologists have called the discovery exciting and unusual, noting that while fingerprints are sometimes found, a full handprint is exceptionally rare. The artifact will be a centerpiece in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum focusing on the artisans of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has confirmed a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to Tesla, a deal pivotal for the electric vehicle maker's artificial intelligence ambitions. According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of the partnership, noting that Tesla will assist in optimizing manufacturing efficiency. The contract, which runs until the end of 2033, caused Samsung's shares to surge and highlights the intense competition in the advanced AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies specializing in LNG exportation and infrastructure, such as Cheniere and Venture Global, saw their stock values increase.

          <p>Amid unprecedented growth in viewership and revenue, WNBA players are intensifying their push for better pay, arguing they deserve a larger share of the league's income. The league's recent success, amplified by stars like Caitlin Clark, has led to a new media rights deal valued at over $2 billion and soaring franchise valuations. However, players currently receive less than 10% of the league's revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share in men's professional sports leagues. This disparity is at the heart of ongoing collective-bargaining negotiations, as players argue their labor is generating immense value.</p>

          <p>A real estate expert advises that homebuyers can negotiate on numerous aspects of a sale beyond the final price to save money and reduce stress.

Other negotiable items include personal property like furniture, additional inspections, pre-closing repairs, and even having the seller cover a year of HOA fees.
