        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Home Office has announced the arrival of the first family under its new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. The scheme, established by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, involves the UK accepting a refugee with a valid protection case for every migrant returned to France who had their asylum claim withdrawn or deemed inadmissible. This development follows the recent removal of four migrants from the UK to France, as the government aims to deter people-smuggling gangs. Over 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats this year.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Texas have encountered multiple rare and massive "pink meanie" jellyfish that have washed ashore along the Gulf coast. Known scientifically as Drymonema larsoni, this species was only identified in 2011 and can weigh over 50 pounds with tentacles extending up to 70 feet. Jace Tunnell of the Harte Research Institute noted their appearance is linked to the abundance of their primary food source, moon jellyfish. While their sting is considered mild, their presence is a surprising natural event, highlighting the unique biodiversity of the region.</p>

          <p>Amid rising bond yields that are pressuring the S&P 500, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Boeing as his "favorite stock" in his charitable trust portfolio. His confidence follows a recent pullback in the stock's price, U.S. lawmakers advocating for China to purchase Boeing aircraft, and a new AI partnership with Palantir. Cramer also commented on Nvidia's recent dip, expressing some concern over its vendor financing model with OpenAI. The discussion highlights investor strategies in a market reacting to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged by over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oregon authorities have recovered the partial remains of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," marking a potential breakthrough in the state's oldest unidentified-person case. The woman's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but key evidence, including her remains, went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery, leading to their exhumation. Authorities are hopeful that modern forensic testing can finally identify the victim, who was determined to have died from blunt-force trauma to the head.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed in 2023 as New York City's first-ever citywide director of rodent mitigation, or "rat czar," has resigned from her post. Corradi was tasked with combating the city's estimated 3 million rats, with a budget of $3.5 million for initiatives that included public awareness campaigns and rodent birth control. Mayor Eric Adams praised her work, noting a decrease in rat-related calls to the city's 311 service line during her tenure. Despite her departure from the role, Adams has vowed that the city's efforts to control its rodent population will continue unabated.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Sales of New Homes Surged by Over 20% in August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 11:50:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. experienced a much larger-than-expected increase of 20.5% in August compared to July, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This spike occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, suggesting other factors like homebuilder incentives may have driven the demand. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a 9-month supply in July. Analysts caution that the data is volatile and has a large margin of error, but it points to continued strength in the new construction market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the north shore town of Paia on Maui prompted officials to issue evacuation orders, sound emergency sirens, and conduct door-to-door warnings on Tuesday. The fire grew to over 100 acres, sparking fear among residents still mindful of the devastating Lahaina fire in 2023. However, firefighters were able to halt the blaze's forward progress, and evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the threat receded. The incident demonstrated a more proactive emergency response compared to last year's tragedy, which was criticized for the failure to activate warning sirens.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram now has 3 billion monthly active users, a significant milestone for the photo and video-sharing platform.

          <p>A personal finance column advises a 55-year-old man who is facing a layoff and has not filed taxes for two decades despite accumulating significant assets, including $1 million in cryptocurrency. The expert strongly urges him to immediately hire a CPA and contact the IRS, noting that while the situation is serious, it is manageable since he was employed and likely had taxes withheld. The advice also covers retirement strategy, explaining how the "rule of 55" could allow for penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals. The column stresses the importance of addressing the tax delinquency to avoid more severe consequences.</p>

          <h2>James Webb Telescope Discovery of Colossal Object Could Challenge Cosmological Models</h2>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a mysterious, massive object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this discovery would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations just after the Big Bang, before any stars existed. While alternative explanations for the object exist, such as a black hole formed directly from a gas cloud, the finding forces scientists to reconsider the sequence of events that shaped the nascent cosmos.</p>
