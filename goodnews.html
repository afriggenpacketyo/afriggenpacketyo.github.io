          <p>Billy Wilder's 1950 noir masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary with a restored 4K release. The article explores the film's enduring legacy, featuring interviews with 97-year-old co-star Nancy Olson, who reflects on the production and her work with Gloria Swanson and William Holden. It also discusses the film's adaptation into a successful stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, including the recent Tony-winning revival starring Nicole Scherzinger. The piece highlights how the movie's themes of Hollywood's cruelty, fame, and obsession remain relevant and impactful decades later.</p>

          <p>This article details the year-and-a-half-long process that Senate Republicans undertook to craft and pass President Trump's $3.3 trillion legislative package. The effort, which began with policy retreats well before the 2024 election, involved intense internal negotiations to unify the party on priorities like tax cut extensions and border security. The passage was dramatic, overcoming resistance from fiscal hawks who wanted deeper spending cuts and other members concerned about changes to Medicaid. The final bill ultimately passed with only three Republican senators voting against it, showcasing the party's dealmaking to deliver on a key Trump promise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 09:47:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the history of the first lighthouse fully funded and constructed by the U.S. government, the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia. The contract for its construction was signed on March 31, 1791, by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, and it was completed the following year. For nearly 90 years, the original stone tower guided ships with its fish-oil-fueled lamps before being replaced by a taller iron structure. The piece also notes the evolution of lighthouses, their automation since 1998, and the technological advancements that have largely replaced the traditional lighthouse keeper.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 to take a 13-month career break and move to Taiwan with their young son, Forrest. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents and immerse him in the culture. During the sabbatical, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, realizing he no longer needed to chase high-pressure, high-salary jobs to be happy. The transformative experience, which included the birth of their second child, has led the family to reconsider their career priorities upon their return to the U.S., valuing flexibility and family time more than ever.</p>

          <p>As cyberattacks become more sophisticated with the help of generative AI, companies are now deploying autonomous AI agents as a crucial part of their defense strategy. These "agentic teammates" are designed to automate routine and time-consuming security tasks, such as investigating alerts and analyzing potential threats, freeing up human analysts to focus on more critical work. Cybersecurity experts believe this technology is essential to counter the rising threat from AI-powered attacks and to help address the industry's talent shortage. While still in early stages, these AI agents are seen as augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them, making security operations more efficient and effective.</p>

          <h2>Debut Novel 'The Hounding' Explores Fear of Femininity Through a Tale of Witchcraft</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the historical fear of female power through the story of five sisters in 18th-century England who are accused of being witches. The narrative, told from the perspectives of outsiders, explores why the sisters' strangeness and transgression of social norms lead the community to believe they can transform into dogs. The book directly engages with the subtext of witch stories, where femininity itself is perceived as a threat. While the novel's themes can sometimes feel familiar, its lush, violent prose and satirical take on cultural anxieties offer a fresh perspective on persecution and womanhood.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little made an extraordinary 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The kick, which appeared to have enough distance to be good from nearly 75 yards, caused a massive celebration among his teammates. However, the kick will not count as an official NFL record because it occurred during a preseason game. The current NFL record is a 66-yard field goal made by Baltimore's Justin Tucker in 2021. Little, a rookie, expressed his desire to make the kick again during the regular season to make it official.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing a temporary break on state and sometimes local taxes for certain purchases. These events are politically popular and often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, with eligible items typically including clothing, school supplies, and computers under a certain price limit. While some tax experts argue that these holidays primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their purchases, many families on tighter budgets plan around them to save money.

The local community rallied to preserve the 12-ton wreck, which researchers have now identified as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham. Originally built in 1749 as the HMS Hind for the British Royal Navy, the vessel was active during the American Revolution before being sold for whaling. The ship ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>Despite a constant stream of negative news, significant global progress is often overlooked due to a psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias. Humans are evolutionarily hardwired to focus on threats, which in the modern world can lead to a skewed, pessimistic view of reality. This article argues for the importance of realistic optimism, highlighting underreported positive trends such as falling murder rates in the U.S. and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. Focusing on what is fixable, rather than only what is broken, can foster resilience and inspire the action needed to solve major problems.</p>

This makes the rock about 20 million years older than planet Earth itself. The object was part of a larger fireball that exploded across the sky in June, generating hundreds of sightings. Researchers identified the fragment as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite, which allowed them to determine its ancient origins.

The tower, known as "el refugio" (the shelter), has been restored to its original style and now features interactive displays and a video wall with over 350 personal testimonies. The project aims to preserve the human tales of survival, hope, and the challenges faced by the exiles who shaped modern Miami.</p>

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's new legislative bill is causing confusion among service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but key details about which occupations and types of gratuities qualify remain unclear. Workers are still liable for state and payroll taxes on tips, and questions persist over how employers will report this income to the IRS.

Tarpley, who developed an eating disorder after her mother's death, discusses how this mindset shift helped her live a full life.

          <p>For individuals concerned about animal welfare but unable to commit to a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, there are practical ways to significantly reduce animal suffering. This article suggests a "reducetarian" approach, focusing on making more ethical choices when consuming animal products. Key recommendations include opting for pasture-raised meat and wild-caught fish over products from factory farms, where animals endure extreme suffering. Another strategy is to eat larger animals like cows instead of chickens, as it takes far fewer lives to produce the same amount of food, though climate impact should also be considered.</p>

          <p>This article recommends Michael Young's 1958 satirical novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy," a book that originally popularized the term but intended it as a pejorative. The story imagines a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement rather than by traditional social class. This new elite governs until a populist revolt challenges their authority. The reviewer notes that Young, a sociologist who helped shape Britain's welfare state, crafted the novel as a warning against a society where intelligence and achievement become the sole determinants of worth and power.</p>
