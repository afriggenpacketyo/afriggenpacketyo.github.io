          <p>Consumer prices in May increased by 2.4% compared to the previous year, with a slight monthly increase of 0.1%, according to the Labor Department. Falling gasoline prices helped offset rising costs in rent and groceries, but Trump's tariffs may have contributed to rising prices in some goods like appliances and toys. Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that the tariffs could reverse progress made on inflation over the past two years, potentially making the Fed cautious about additional interest rate cuts. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady at their next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is strategically managing its position in trade negotiations with the U.S., carefully balancing its leverage by limiting access to rare earth supplies with its desire to maintain a reputation as a reliable supplier.

Weakness in energy and services prices helped offset some increases, and key items expected to show tariff-related increases, such as vehicle and apparel prices, posted declines.

          <p>President Trump announced that a U.S. trade deal with China is complete, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, following trade talks in London that yielded a "framework deal." The agreement would see China maintain its current 10% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports. Under the agreement, China will supply full magnets and necessary rare earths, and the U.S. will provide what was agreed to, including allowing Chinese students to attend U.S. colleges and universities. While the announcement was thin on details, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the framework deal puts meat on the bones of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs.

There have been signs of a slight cooldown in the economy, with 139,000 new jobs added in May, down from the prior 12 months' average.

          <p>An article discusses the importance of friendships, arguing that society often prioritizes romantic relationships at the expense of platonic bonds. The author notes that romantic relationships have taken over friendship in recent years. The article suggests that people can prioritize both love and friendship by seeing the people in their lives as individuals with distinct but equal roles. It also suggests that people can reimagine free time as something worth spending not just with family and other couples but friends, too.</p>

          <h2>Vox Explores the Relationship Between Music and Economic Trends</h2>

          <p>An article from Vox explores the theory of "recession pop," referring to upbeat, bubblegum pop music from the time of the Great Recession. The article questions whether music can accurately predict economic downturns, noting that the concept of "recession pop" is a made-up genre created after the fact. The article suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more related to generational nostalgia than economic indicators. The piece also points out that there was plenty of music during the Great Recession that didn't reflect an upbeat attitude.</p>
