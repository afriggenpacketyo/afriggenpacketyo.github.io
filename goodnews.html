          <p>Japan is implementing new rules on the pronunciation of children's names written in Chinese characters, addressing concerns about overly flashy or unusual readings known as "kirakira names." The move is part of a revised law requiring all names in the national family registry to include phonetic readings, effectively banning interpretations considered too disconnected from the characters used. This measure aims to ensure that names are both meaningful and easily understood, preventing confusion and potential social difficulties for individuals with unconventional names. The new rules are intended to strike a balance between respecting individual expression and maintaining cultural norms in naming practices.</p>

The company has taken down the video and corrected the misinformation after criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. This incident underscores the importance of accurate information dissemination, especially in educational contexts, and highlights the need for tutoring services to ensure the reliability of their content.</p>

Additionally, chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in chefs.

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers are prioritizing his hitting during spring training and gradually progressing his pitching rehabilitation. This timeline allows Ohtani to fully recover and build up his stamina before returning to his dual role as both a hitter and a pitcher. Ohtani threw all his pitches in practice Wednesday, including a slider, which he had previously avoided due to the burden on his elbow.</p>

Feintzeig recalls how watching horror movies helped her cope with grief after a miscarriage.

Nigel Farage's Reform UK is also planning to address the issue and reinstate the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. An investigation into arson attacks linked to properties connected to Starmer is exploring possible Kremlin involvement. Former sub postmaster Alan Bates has criticized the government's handling of compensation for victims of the Post Office scandal. These stories reflect ongoing political debates and social issues in the UK.</p>

          <h2>UK Begins Rail Renationalization with South Western Railways</h2>

          <p>Britain's South Western Railways (SWR) has become the first private operator to return to public ownership, marking the start of a Labour government initiative. The move is part of a broader plan to renationalize the country's rail services by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described it as a watershed moment in returning the railways to public service. The nationalization aims to end decades of fragmentation and save compensation fees paid to rail operators. Other services are set to be nationalized by the end of 2025, with the government asserting that it will improve service.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market continues to thrive despite a national downturn, with wealthy buyers investing in top-tier homes as value-preserving assets amid economic uncertainty. A luxury development in the Huangpu district, One Central Park, sold out all 64 units for 4 billion yuan (US$556 million). This project is located in the city‚Äôs Xintiandi shopping and entertainment area, and sales have exceeded 10.8 billion yuan year-to-date. The sale triggered a points-based allocation system due to high demand. New home prices in Shanghai have risen, outpacing national averages.</p>

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, citing that they are a violation of human rights, as they limit patient visitations, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading COVID-19's threat level, hospitals still enforce strict measures like mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visitation times. These physicians and social workers argue that such restrictions are excessive and lack scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. They advocate for easing restrictions while maintaining appropriate infection control measures, emphasizing the importance of allowing patients to see their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road is set to reopen for the Memorial Day weekend, providing access to the park's eastern entrance. The road, which has been closed since November due to snow and ice, will reopen to all traffic. This year's reopening is about two weeks earlier than last year. The park service will not provide early access to cyclists this year. Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours will need a reservation and should prepare for potential staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related problems may inadvertently pass their stress onto their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with high job stress and work-related rumination exhibited more stress-related behaviors. This connection is driven by 'crossover,' where stress spills over from one person to others, and 'emotional contagion,' where dogs pick up on human feelings. The study suggests that employed dog owners may improve their pet's well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home.</p>

          <p>China's electromagnetic coil gun capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute has been captured on video, raising eyebrows among military experts. A peer-reviewed paper revealed the technology breakthrough behind the coil gun: the world‚Äôs first capacitor-free electromagnetic coil gun, powered directly by lithium batteries. The breakthrough centres on eliminating the Achilles‚Äô heel of electromagnetic weapons ‚Äì capacitors. This advancement surpasses the firing rate of early Chinese prototypes and US-made models, potentially redefining future combat.</p>
