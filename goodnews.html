Despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S. during this period, the growth trend aligns with improved export figures.

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore, seen as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, due to rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A precious metals storage facility called "The Reserve" in Singapore has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April compared to the same period in 2024. The trend is driven by concerns over tariffs, global changes, and potential geopolitical instabilities, with 90% of new orders coming from outside Singapore. Wealthy individuals are opting for physical gold bars over paper assets to reduce counterparty and geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>High-end jewellery designs are increasingly incorporating hidden details that transform rings and necklaces into symbols of meaning, memory, and artistry. Swiss jewellery house G√ºbelin integrates rubies into less visible areas of their creations, while other houses like Van Cleef & Arpels use techniques to conceal metal settings. These subtle details offer wearers a private connection to their jewellery, serving as reminders of loved ones or cherished memories. This trend marks a revival of traditions, like incorporating hair into pieces or embedding materials with symbolic significance.</p>
