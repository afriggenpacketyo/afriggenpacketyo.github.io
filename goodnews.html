          <p>European and Middle Eastern leaders have broadly welcomed President Trump's new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which calls for an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages, and a phased Israeli withdrawal. The plan also stipulates Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza but leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. Key regional and European foreign ministers expressed readiness to engage with the US to finalize the agreement, which also proposes an international transitional body, the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump, with Sir Tony Blair's involvement. This initiative seeks to end the conflict, ensure humanitarian aid, and rebuild Gaza, despite ongoing complexities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, outlines a phased approach to ending the Israel-Hamas war. The proposal mandates an immediate ceasefire, Hamas releasing all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and Israel withdrawing from parts of Gaza, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. It envisions a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" governing Gaza, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, and supported by an International Stabilization Force. The plan also emphasizes demilitarization, significant humanitarian aid, economic development, and leaves room for future Palestinian statehood, though Hamas has yet to formally respond.</p>

          <p>Meng Fanli, the current party chief of Shenzhen, has been promoted to party chief of Guangdong's government, effectively positioning him as the governor-in-waiting for China's largest provincial economy. Meng, 60, previously moved to Guangdong in 2022 to lead Shenzhen. This appointment fills the vacancy left by incumbent governor Wang Weizhong, who was promoted to party chief of Inner Mongolia. These personnel changes follow a monthly Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, signaling shifts in provincial leadership. Meng's prior term in Shenzhen saw the city's GDP growth slow amidst challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic, a property downturn, and the China-US trade war.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos secured a decisive 28-3 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, improving their season record to 2-2. Rookie quarterback Bo Nix led the Broncos' offense effectively, completing 29 of 42 passes for 326 yards and two touchdowns, alongside a rushing score. The Bengals, now also 2-2, struggled significantly on offense with backup quarterback Jake Browning, who managed only 125 passing yards and no touchdowns. Denver's defense was instrumental, sacking Browning three times and forcing nine consecutive third-down stops. Running back J.K. Dobbins also surpassed 100 rushing yards, contributing to the Broncos' comprehensive win.</p>

Hill, a five-time All-Pro, dislocated his left knee, an injury confirmed by head coach Mike McDaniel. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 177 yards and two touchdowns, maintaining his undefeated record against the Jets as a starter. The Jets, now 0-4, struggled with penalties and turnovers, despite a strong ground game, and remain winless under coach Aaron Glenn.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs, found malnourished and alone earlier this year, have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to encourage natural hunting behaviors and habitat familiarization. This successful release is crucial for conservation efforts, as wild mountain lion populations in California have significantly decreased, now estimated between 3,200 and 4,500, classifying the species as "near-threatened." The rehabilitation process ensures they are less likely to engage with humans, enhancing their survival chances in rural areas and contributing to the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the MLB playoffs with a distinct dynamic compared to last year, having shed the "postseason failures" reputation with their 2020 World Series win and a championship last year. Despite an underwhelming 93-win regular season, they aim to overcome the pressure of high expectations and become the first repeat champion in 25 years. Manager Dave Roberts notes a significantly healthier starting rotation this year, contrasting with last season's bullpen strength. The team is focused on maintaining momentum from a strong finish to the regular season and finding a new identity for the postseason, with key players returning from injury.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will address the Labour Party conference, declaring Britain is "at a fork in the road" and emphasizing a choice between national renewal and decline. His speech aims to distinguish Labour's vision from Reform UK, portraying his path as "hard" but leading to "decency" and "a new country." This comes amid criticism of his leadership, including recent ministerial reshuffles and dire opinion polls. Starmer will also need to navigate a difficult budget, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves signaling potential tax rises. He seeks to unite the country around a "common good," improving living standards and growing the economy from the grassroots.</p>

          <p>Paralympic long jumper and sprinter Stef Reid, who lost her right foot in a boat accident at 15, is campaigning for major sportswear brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes instead of pairs. Reid, a world champion and MBE recipient, highlights the financial burden and impracticality for amputees who only need one shoe, wasting hundreds of pounds on unused footwear. Her motivation extends beyond cost, emphasizing the principle of matching inclusive imagery—often featuring bladed mannequins—with an inclusive buying experience. The campaign also seeks to benefit thousands of people with different sized feet, who are similarly forced to buy two shoes.</p>

          <p>Vail town officials are finalizing a pioneering ordinance to ban single-use plastics, including water bottles under one gallon, takeout containers, cutlery, straws, and cups with lids, as part of a major environmental shift. The initiative, proposed by local students, aims to make Vail more sustainable, following examples like Lake Tahoe's "Drink Tahoe Tap" campaign. While there's excitement about reducing plastic waste and inspiring reuse, concerns remain regarding infrastructure, particularly the availability and cost of expanding water refill stations. Council members seek a clear cost projection before approval, acknowledging the inconsistency of banning only water bottles while other plastic-bottled beverages remain available.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Hong Kong could become China's crucial gateway to the United Nations, reinforcing Beijing's vision of global governance and addressing the UN's need for inclusive reforms. Despite UN headquarters in New York, Nairobi, Vienna, and Geneva, Asia, with 60% of the world's population, lacks a major hub. Leveraging Hong Kong's unique position—its common law tradition, official English language, and low corporate taxes—could enhance China's engagement with the UN, to which it is the second-largest donor. The article proposes that instead of merely telling China's story, Hong Kong could bring the world to China, exemplified by institutions like the International Organisation for Mediation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the job cuts, which would affect the vast majority of VOA's remaining staff, cannot proceed. This decision follows Lamberth's earlier rulings that the administration must restore VOA programming to statutory levels and blocked the removal of VOA's director. The judge accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" towards the court, as plaintiffs argued the cuts would hamper VOA's mission to provide fact-based news globally.</p>

          <p>The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is nearing inauguration, poised to significantly ease congestion at Mumbai's current overworked airport and elevate India's aviation profile. Spread over 1,100 hectares and connected by India's longest sea-bridge, NMIA will eventually handle 90 million passengers annually, becoming India's first fully digital airport designed as a hub. While major airlines like Indigo, Akasa, and Air India have committed to new routes, the airport faces challenges, particularly last-mile connectivity for passengers due to its distance from central Mumbai. Until metro links are established, this could hinder its ambition to become a global aviation hub like Singapore or Dubai.</p>

          <p>"The White Lotus" star Aimee Lou Wood asserts she does not regret publicly criticizing a "Saturday Night Live" sketch that mocked her teeth and accent, which she found "mean and unfunny." Wood, 31, explained that speaking out was a deliberate choice to break a pattern of silence she experienced with bullying in her youth. The sketch, which aired in April, drew criticism for perceived "1970s misogyny" and prompted an apology from SNL bosses. Wood is currently promoting her new BBC romantic-comedy drama, "Film Club," a series she co-wrote that explores themes of loneliness, love, and mental health during the pandemic.</p>
