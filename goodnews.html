          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has outlined plans to reduce the number of senior military officers and restructure the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China. While directing the Pentagon to cut four-star admirals and generals by 20%, Hegseth aims to streamline leadership and eliminate redundant military structures, however details remain scarce. The Army's transformation involves fielding long-range missiles and drones while divesting outdated formations, with some officials expressing concern over the lack of specifics and potential for partisan motivations behind the cuts. Sen. Jack Reed has voiced skepticism about the rationale behind these plans, emphasizing the need for personnel decisions to be based on facts and analysis rather than arbitrary percentages.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by strong sales growth of 36%. CEO Lisa Su noted that the company navigated regulatory challenges related to advanced AI chip exports, which resulted in $800 million in costs and an expected $700 million in lost revenue for the current quarter. The company's data center segment, fueled by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw a 57% increase in sales. AMD anticipates approximately $7.4 billion in sales for the current quarter, despite facing headwinds from macroeconomic and regulatory environments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fencing match in Maryland has ignited a national debate after a fencer refused to compete against a transgender opponent, leading to a congressional hearing and increased scrutiny of transgender athletes in sports. Stephanie Turner declined to participate against Red Sullivan, citing that the event was for women only, leading to her disqualification. The incident has been politicized, with some conservative figures claiming it threatens fair competition and puts female athletes at risk. U.S.A. Fencing and the International Olympic Committee are grappling with the issue, with discussions around potentially restricting eligibility based on biological sex, highlighting the complexities and lack of research surrounding transgender athletes in sports.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under President Trump is pulling back enforcement of a rule that classified Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers as credit card issuers, easing consumer protection requirements. The CFPB is considering rescinding the rule entirely, citing a need to focus resources on other pressing threats to consumers. This decision follows opposition from BNPL firms, who argued that the credit card rules were confusing and unnecessary, while new data reveals that nearly half of BNPL users have faced financial problems tied to these services. As usage rises, particularly for essentials like groceries, missed payments are increasing as well.</p>

          <p>J's Grocery, a Black-owned supermarket in Clarksdale, Mississippi, has reopened after renovations, now offering fresh produce to a primarily Black community. The store's transformation is a collaboration between the owner, local farmers, and organizations like Partnership for a Healthier America, Rootswell, and Novo Nordisk. The initiative aims to combat food insecurity in the Mississippi Delta, where fertile land is primarily used for cash crops rather than food for local consumption. The revamped grocery store also features a community gathering space, addressing transportation challenges and providing access to culturally relevant produce.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aiming to facilitate exports of UK goods like whisky and cars to India, while reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The British government has hailed the agreement as "landmark" and the "biggest and most economically significant" bilateral trade deal since Brexit. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was "ambitious and mutually beneficial", which will help "catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies". The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are likely to raise prices on flowers ahead of Mother's Day, impacting both consumers and florists. While Mr. Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, with the bulk coming from Colombia and Ecuador. Even small growers who import bulbs are affected, and some florists are attempting to source more local flowers to mitigate the impact.</p>
