          <p>Joey Chestnut, a 16-time champion, will return to the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island after being sidelined last year due to a sponsorship conflict. Chestnut expressed his excitement about returning to the event, which he considers a cherished tradition and celebration of American culture. Last year, Chestnut was banned from the contest due to a partnership with Impossible Foods, a plant-based meat substitute company, but he has since resolved the issue with Major League Eating (MLE). The competition will feature a face-off between Chestnut and Patrick Bertoletti, the reigning champion.</p>

The production team utilizes the entire castle estate for missions designed to test contestants, and Cumming's wardrobe has evolved into elaborate and "creepy glam" looks inspired by each episode.

The expansion comes after Waymo's electric Jaguars have become a common sight in Los Angeles, providing rides to customers through the Waymo app. Waymo vehicles rely on cameras, sensors, and lidar to operate autonomously, and the company reports fewer crashes compared to traditional vehicles.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs after previously accusing those calling for one of jumping on a far-right bandwagon. The decision follows a report by Baroness Casey, who initially believed local inquiries would suffice but changed her mind due to a lack of volunteer councils and reluctance from some organizations to cooperate. The report recommends a national police operation to review unacted cases and a national inquiry overseen by an Independent Commission. Starmer emphasized the inquiry must address all relevant factors, including ethnicity and the role of public officials.</p>

The blackout, which lasted for more than 10 hours, was due to a combination of technical faults and planning issues, according to Spanish Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen. The problem began with a voltage surge in southern Spain, causing small grid failures that led to a chain reaction of protective shutdowns.
