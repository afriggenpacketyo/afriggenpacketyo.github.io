          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, emphasizing the need for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and barriers. Li stated that globalization is irreversible and urged countries not to politicize trade or view it as a security issue. He called for countries to stay on the "right" path and engage in the international economy to reshape global rules and order. Adam Tooze from Columbia University interpreted Li's remarks as a call for a pluralization of processes in shaping the global order, emphasizing process over centralized control. Optimism for international trade relations is somewhat tempered given the current geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jordan's men's national football team has qualified for their first World Cup, generating excitement and inspiring the women's team to strive for the 2027 Women's World Cup. The women's team narrowly missed qualifying for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments, but they aim for a top-six finish in the 2026 Asian Cup to secure a spot in Brazil 2027. Jordan launched its women's program in 2005, and it has steadily grown, with more women participating as players, coaches, referees, and administrators. The men's World Cup qualification is expected to bring financial benefits to the Jordan Football Association, which could lead to increased opportunities and investment in the women's game. This development is certainly a positive one for the sport in Jordan.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 03:00:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over the origins of COVID-19, whether from natural origins or a lab leak, is more about public distrust of science than a right-wing conspiracy. While some dismiss the lab leak theory as misinformation, many credible scientists believe the question is unsettled due to China's lack of transparency. The controversy reflects anxieties over virus research, especially gain-of-function studies, and a perception that scientists have not adequately addressed public concerns. The author argues that trust must be cultivated through transparency, accountability, and humility, rather than simply presenting more facts. Public trust in science is essential for addressing future health crises.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC fired Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Lattouf said she was punished for her political opinion. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, saying that it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter. This outcome is certainly a positive sign for free speech.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament, which has often clashed with China, is attempting to normalize relations after four years of estrangement. President Roberta Metsola has led the effort, seeking to re-establish constructive parliamentary relations. This initiative includes meetings with the Chinese ambassador to the EU and efforts to revitalize legislative dialogue. The move aims to improve communication and cooperation between the EU and China on various issues. This is a sign of improving relations.</p>
