          <p>A new documentary titled "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley" offers an intimate and honest look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. The film, directed by Amy Berg, moves beyond the typical narrative of a doomed artist to explore his complex personality, creative process, and internal struggles with fame.

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China, stated that growing geopolitical tensions are the biggest challenge currently facing academic freedom and scientific research. In an interview, Xi Youmin argued that the world's divisive state is permeating universities and stifling collaboration. He suggested that one way to improve understanding and ease these pressures on campuses would be for China to relax visa restrictions for foreign students and visitors. Xi believes this could help bridge the gap in a world being restructured by conflict and political pressure.</p>

          <p>At a White House ceremony hosted by President Trump, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement, officially ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The leaders of both nations praised Trump's role as a peacemaker and announced they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize. A key component of the deal is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, which will be developed exclusively by the United States. This agreement marks a significant geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the death of astronaut Jim Lovell at the age of 97. Lovell is best known as the commander of the Apollo 13 mission, which famously returned to Earth safely after an in-flight oxygen tank explosion, earning the moniker of a "successful failure." He was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, the first to orbit the moon, and captured the iconic "Earthrise" photograph. Lovell's calm leadership under extreme pressure during the Apollo 13 crisis was widely praised and later immortalized in the 1995 film starring Tom Hanks.</p>

The event comes after the shelter recently took in 84 cats and kittens, adding to the need for temporary homes. Guests can enjoy games and cotton candy while learning about the fostering process, with same-day fostering available. The shelter provides all necessary supplies and veterinary care, emphasizing that fostering significantly reduces overcrowding and increases a pet's chance of being adopted into a permanent home.</p>

          <p>The death of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell leaves only five surviving astronauts who traveled to the Moon during the Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s. This article reflects on the end of an era as the number of these space pioneers dwindles more than 50 years after their historic missions. It provides brief profiles of the remaining five men: Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Fred Haise, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott. Their stories are highlighted in the context of a renewed international race to the moon, led by NASA's Artemis program and efforts from China.</p>

          <h2>British MP Mistakenly Reports Charity Rowers as 'Illegal Migrants'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 17:10:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted he mistakenly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. He alerted authorities and demanded mass deportations before the crew's identity was confirmed by the HM Coastguard. The rowers, who were raising money for motor neurone disease research, found the incident hilarious. After realizing his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while maintaining his strong stance on illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization.

In response, President Trump indicated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating major investor concerns about the company's profitability. This positive development came shortly after Apple reported strong quarterly earnings with double-digit growth in revenue and iPhone sales.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some parts of the U.S., particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant declines from their 2022 peaks, a trend attributed to rising housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience tight inventory and rising prices. This regional divergence creates a varied market, offering more balance for buyers in some areas while remaining challenging in others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is leveraging bipartisan federal support to strengthen its domestic mining and metals refining industries to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like China.

The plant will process nickel, a critical material for EV batteries and defense technology, from a Minnesota mine. This strategic investment aims to secure domestic supply chains for essential raw materials, an issue viewed as critical for both economic and national security.</p>
