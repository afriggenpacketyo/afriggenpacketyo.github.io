          <p>The Trump administration is planning to end the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance initiative aimed at identifying potential terrorist threats. The program, which began in 2010, has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens without suspicion of any crime, leading to debates about its uneven application. Senator Jeanne Shaheen's husband was placed on the watchlist in 2023 but was removed after she contacted the TSA director. It is unclear whether Quiet Skies staff will be reassigned or if the federal air marshals will continue their work.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, exceeding the expected range of $27 to $28, giving the company a market value of $6.8 billion. The offering will raise $1.05 billion through the sale of 34 million shares, with Circle granting underwriters an option to sell an additional 5.1 million shares. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares. Circle earned $156 million in net income in 2024 on $1.68 billion in revenue and reserve income, marking a significant event for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Skepticism About the Value of College Education Persists</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite college graduation ceremonies being a time of celebration, skepticism about the value of higher education persists, with confidence in colleges declining over the past decade. A recent report indicates that only one in four Americans believes a four-year degree is essential for a well-paying job. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates is at its highest since 2021, further fueling doubts. While immediate post-pandemic trends may influence recent unemployment stats, questions about the benefit of a college degree predate the pandemic, with the earnings gap between college graduates and high school graduates remaining consistent since 2010.</p>

          <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a historic site of the Greek Orthodox Church. This assurance follows an Egyptian court ruling that sparked concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders regarding the monastery's ownership claims to the land it occupies. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and its religious sites, despite ruling that the land is public property. Saint Catherine's Monastery, established in the sixth century, holds immense religious and historical significance as the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery.</p>

          <p>A plume of Saharan dust is expected to increase over Florida on Thursday, potentially spreading as far as Texas and Georgia as a weather system breaks it apart. This phenomenon is common during the summer months, as dust from the Sahara Desert travels across the Atlantic Ocean. The dust can affect air quality and create vibrant sunsets, but it can also exacerbate respiratory issues for some individuals.</p>

          <p>Zoe Salda√±a revealed that she "collapsed" immediately following her Oscars win for "Emilia P√©rez," citing exhaustion and a cold. She explained that her body had been running on adrenaline for months during awards season and that the physical and emotional toll led to her losing her voice and feeling the need to cry. The film, while successful during awards season, faced criticism for its portrayal of transgender issues and Mexico, leading to Salda√±a defending the film's intent. Despite the film's success, there have been issues related to the production and cast.</p>
