        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a previous withdrawal of his nomination, President Trump has met again with billionaire Jared Isaacman to discuss leading NASA. Isaacman, a seasoned space traveler with ties to SpaceX, was initially nominated but the offer was rescinded amid tensions between Trump and Elon Musk. The potential reappointment comes as NASA faces significant challenges, including proposed budget cuts of over $6 billion and a staff reduction of approximately 4,000 employees due to a government efficiency initiative. The renewed talks suggest a possible reconciliation and a new direction for the U.S. space program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, adjusting income thresholds to account for inflation. This annual change is intended to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets, and will result in Americans needing to earn more before facing a higher tax rate. For 2026, the standard deduction will be $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. The adjustments reflect provisions from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made many 2017 tax cuts permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent media conference, Paramount CEO David Ellison asserted his control over the company's day-to-day operations while acknowledging his father, Larry Ellison, as the largest shareholder and a key mentor. Since the Ellison family's acquisition, Paramount's stock has risen over 50%, partly fueled by speculation about a potential merger with Warner Bros. Discovery. David Ellison emphasized a strategy focused on creating value for shareholders and talent, suggesting an increase in content production rather than cost-cutting. He also noted his family's good relationship with the Trump administration, a potential advantage in future consolidation efforts.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Los Angeles author D.J. Waldie reflects on his 30-year career writing about the city, culminating in his new book, "Elements of Los Angeles." Waldie argues that for Angelenos to make better decisions about the city's future, they must develop a deep, affective connection to its complex and often overlooked history. He advocates for moving beyond Hollywood clichés to find reasons to engage with the everyday realities of the place. Waldie suggests that this act of "falling in love" with the imperfect city is essential for resisting forces that seek to deconstruct it.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss announced third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The denim company's gross margin grew to 61.7%, and it has successfully raised prices on some items without negatively impacting demand. As a result, Levi's has raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 3% and its adjusted earnings per share outlook. The strong performance reflects the success of CEO Michelle Gass's strategy to expand beyond jeans and grow its direct sales channels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-based rare earth and critical mineral companies surged after China announced new export licensing requirements for products containing these materials. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to tighten its control over global technology supply chains and has fueled speculation that the U.S. government will increase investment in domestic production. Companies like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials saw significant stock gains. The restrictions highlight the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with these crucial materials being a major point of contention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai, known for his long, labyrinthine sentences and themes of political oppression and existential dread, has won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature. His work, including the acclaimed 1989 novel "The Melancholy of Resistance," often explores the stultifying effects of authoritarianism in a way that transcends specific historical contexts. The Nobel committee's choice highlights a writer who translates the specific history of Soviet-era Hungary into a timeless and universal language. Krasznahorkai's selection is seen as both a nod to experimental prose and a continuation of the committee's tradition of honoring politically resonant authors.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a U.S.-backed peace plan, beginning with a ceasefire set to take effect shortly after approval by the Israeli Cabinet. The initial stage involves Hamas releasing its 20 remaining living hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for Israel freeing approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and partially withdrawing troops. Following the hostage release, hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian aid are expected to enter Gaza. Subsequent phases of the plan, which require further negotiation, address the long-term governance of Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that by successfully brokering a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, President Trump has now taken ownership of the immense challenge of stabilizing the Middle East. The author applies a "you patch it, you own it" corollary to foreign policy, suggesting the president is now responsible for the plan's complex implementation. This includes overseeing Hamas's disarmament, managing a multinational stabilization force, and navigating the difficult politics of Gaza's reconstruction. The success of this high-stakes endeavor will have major consequences for America's global standing and influence in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>In his first solo directing project, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the career of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film focuses on Kerr's struggle with painkiller addiction and the emotional fallout of his decline after a period of dominance in the late '90s. Safdie explains his interest in understanding what a champion becomes when they start to lose, aiming for an uncomfortable but humanizing portrait. The movie represents a significant dramatic turn for Johnson, who underwent a physical transformation to portray the vulnerable side of a seemingly invincible athlete.</p>

          <p>While the initial phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal is being celebrated, sources familiar with the negotiations emphasize that major challenges must still be overcome to achieve a lasting peace. Key unresolved issues in President Trump's 20-point plan include the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of an international body to govern Gaza. European and Arab allies are set to meet in Paris to discuss the "day after" scenario, focusing on security, governance, and reconstruction. These complex points will require extensive further negotiation long after the first hostages are released.</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the transformative experience of learning English as a second language. The author recounts moving from Spain to the U.S. and discovering the cultural and emotional nuances that separate academic learning from true fluency. The article delves into how adopting a new language allows one to write, think, and even fall in love in new ways, effectively creating a second self. While acknowledging the cognitive debates around bilingualism and the rise of AI translation, the author argues that the personal odyssey of mastering another tongue remains an irreplaceable journey of self-discovery.</p>
