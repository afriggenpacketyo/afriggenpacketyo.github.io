          <p>Former Boston Red Sox player Mookie Betts expressed surprise and dismay over the team's trade of Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants. The trade, which sent Devers to the Giants in exchange for several players, has stunned many in the baseball world. Clayton Kershaw also commented on the trade, acknowledging Devers as one of the top hitters in the game. The Red Sox's roster has significantly changed since their 2018 World Series victory, with Devers being one of the last core pieces from that team.</p>

          <p>Florida has removed a record haul of invasive Burmese pythons, with biologists extracting 20 tons of the snakes from the Everglades region over a decade. The Conservancy of Southwest Florida's efforts showcase progress in combating the python takeover, though complete eradication is unlikely. The removal efforts focus on tracking and capturing female pythons during the breeding season using radio telemetry, which helps prevent thousands of eggs from hatching. Public engagement, including the Florida python challenge, also aids in the removal efforts.</p>
