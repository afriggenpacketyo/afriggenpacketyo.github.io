        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) made the decision after a thorough review of the evidence, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe had been suspended by the party in March amid claims of threats towards the party's chairman. This resolves a legal issue for Lowe, allowing him to move forward after his suspension from the Reform party.</p>

          <p>A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greece, prompting Greek Emergency Management to issue a tsunami warning. The earthquake's epicenter was located approximately 9 miles south of Fry, Greece. Residents were urged to move away from the coast immediately as a precaution. While initial reports suggested a possible tsunami risk, further updates will be needed to assess the full impact and potential damage from the earthquake. The USGS reported the quake as occurring nearly 30 miles southeast of Kasos as a 5.9 magnitude earthquake.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy would fully cover normal delivery costs under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by insurance, allowing medical institutions to set their own prices, leading to cost variations. The government provides a lump-sum payment, but delivery costs often exceed this amount, so this new policy is intended to make childbirth more financially accessible and encourage families to have children.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility has created concerns for families saving for college using 529 plans, as account values fluctuate. Financial experts advise checking asset allocations and risk appetite, suggesting a shift to more conservative investments as college nears. While cautioning against panic selling, they recommend considering income or savings outside the 529 plan for immediate tuition needs, allowing time for market recovery. New regulations now allow rolling over unused 529 funds into a Roth IRA and using them for continuing education or student loan payments, increasing the plans' flexibility.

          <p>Goldman Sachs President John Waldron noted that investors have recently trimmed their U.S. dollar holdings, returning to more neutral positions on the currency. This repositioning occurred after the Trump administration's tariff policies prompted some investors to move away from American assets. Waldron clarified that this shift reflects a reduction of excess dollar holdings rather than a complete sell-off. Despite concerns about the volatility of U.S. policymaking, investors have not yet significantly reduced their overall holdings.
