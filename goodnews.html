          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's effort to withhold transportation grant funding from states that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case brought by 20 states, arguing that the Department of Transportation's conditions on funding were unlawful. McConnell stated that there was no clear connection between cooperating with ICE and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation, which are to maintain and improve transportation infrastructure. The ruling prevents the administration from imposing immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funding, ensuring that states can continue to receive federal dollars for essential transportation projects. (not investment advice) The stability of transportation services is necessary to avoid potential disruptions and protect public safety. Optimism is moderate given the article is reporting on the legal system functioning as designed.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a spike of 101.7% year-over-year in May, following similar surges in previous months. This surge in rice prices has contributed to Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023, putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to potentially raise interest rates. The government has released emergency stockpiles in an attempt to moderate the price of rice, a staple food in the country, but it remains to be seen whether these measures will have a significant impact. (not investment advice) The extent of these reductions on the real economy is dependent on if the rice prices extend to processed foods, and potentially lowering restaurant prices. The situation is relatively stable as the government is actively taking measures to address the rising inflation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures from last month and a recent trade deal with the United States. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations from a Reuters poll. The move comes after authorities cut lending rates in May for the first time since October to mitigate the impact of trade tensions with Washington, with the trade deal easing concerns by allowing rare earth and tech trade between the two countries. (not investment advice) Chinese policymakers may explore alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth while maintaining a restrained approach to interest rate cuts. This suggests a moderate optimism as the central bank is not making any drastic changes, but rather maintaining the status quo.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its influence in Central Asia, raising questions about the implications for Russia's regional dominance, especially as Russia remains focused on the Ukraine war. At a recent high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners emphasized their shared security concerns and presented a united front amidst global instability. While the Kremlin dismisses any concerns about waning influence, diplomatic observers note that Moscow's capacity to counterbalance China's growing presence is limited. China is avoiding challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor, but China's expanding economic and political ties in the region suggest a shifting dynamic. The situation is relatively stable given the cooperative nature of the involved parties.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in May increased by 3.7% compared to the previous year, marking the most significant rise in over two years, primarily driven by soaring rice and food costs. The nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Rice prices, which more than doubled, continue to be a major factor in the overall increase in food costs, despite stabilizing fresh food prices. (not investment advice) While the government expects rice prices to decline with the new harvest in the fall, the upward trend is likely to persist for several months, affecting consumer spending and economic stability.

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been aggressively pursuing talent in the artificial intelligence field, recently hiring Daniel Gross, the CEO of Safe Superintelligence, after an attempted acquisition of the startup failed. Earlier in the year, Meta tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, but Ilya Sutskever, the startup's founder, declined the offer. In addition to Gross, Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO, will also be joining Meta, with Meta acquiring a stake in their venture capital firm, NFDG. Zuckerberg's actions highlight the intense competition for AI talent among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, as they race to develop more powerful large language models. The hiring of Gross and Friedman are potentially positive for Meta as the company expands its focus on AI.</p>

          <p>The National Guard has been deployed to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to assist with crime-plagued areas, specifically the Central Avenue Corridor. However, unlike other deployments, these Guard members are unarmed and not in military uniform, focusing on securing perimeters to free up police officers. The deployment follows a request from the Albuquerque Police Chief due to high levels of shootings, assaults, and drug abuse. While some welcome the additional support, concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of unarmed Guard members in addressing violent crime. The situation is relatively stable as the National Guard is assisting the police department.</p>
