          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, although a final agreement has not yet been signed. The discussions come as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a federal law requiring it to divest the app's U.S. business or face a ban due to national security concerns. Despite bipartisan support for the law, President Trump has repeatedly extended the divestment deadline, expressing a desire to keep the popular social media platform active in the country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for containing excessive praise for the president and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. While the suit was thrown out, the judge has allowed Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise, 40-page amended complaint that adheres to proper legal standards.</p>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee has voted on several key vaccine recommendations, notably shifting its guidance on COVID-19 shots for most Americans. The panel now advocates for "individual-based decision-making" in consultation with healthcare providers, rather than a broad recommendation for everyone. For measles, the committee now supports separate MMR and varicella shots for children under four to reduce the slight risk of fever-related seizures associated with the combined MMRV vaccine. The panel also unanimously supported testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, a deal that would value the company at an immense $200 billion. This fundraising effort highlights the massive and rapidly escalating valuations within the generative AI sector, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk has denied that xAI is currently raising capital, the reported funds would likely be used to acquire vast numbers of AI chips and build the extensive data center infrastructure needed to develop next-generation AI models.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. This rise in long-term yields suggests that investors are weighing factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to issue more debt. The market's reaction reflects a complex economic outlook, where calming data on jobless claims has eased some concerns about a slowing economy, influencing investor sentiment on longer-term bonds.

A financial analysis suggests that some of the cheapest ways to borrow money now include home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, and personal loans, all of which currently offer lower average rates than credit cards. With HELOCs featuring variable rates, they may become even more affordable if the Fed continues to lower rates in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
