          <p>Governors Wes Moore of Maryland and Tim Walz of Minnesota addressed Democrats at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina, urging the party to adopt a more forceful approach. Both governors emphasized the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies, highlighting the urgency of the current political moment. While denying any immediate presidential aspirations for 2028, they stressed the need to focus on the challenges of 2025, advocating for the party to present a clear alternative to Trump's policies and actively compete in every district. The governors' remarks underscored a call for greater impatience and proactive engagement to win back lost American voters.</p>

          <p>An NPR producer and a group of friends have been recreating the reality TV show 'Survivor' for the past four years, complete with challenges, alliances, and tribal councils. What started as a pandemic-era binge-watching hobby has evolved into a highly anticipated annual event, involving friends from across the country who travel to different locations for a three-day weekend of competition. The games are meticulously planned by two designated 'Jeffs' each year, who spend months devising challenges and twists, while other friends serve as producers, recording content for their Instagram fanbase. This past Memorial Day weekend, the fourth annual games were held in Collegeville, PA, with participants strategizing, blindsiding, and voting each other off for the chance to win bragging rights.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are offering a supportive environment for individuals with dementia and their caregivers, providing camaraderie and recreational activities. These cafes, numbering over 600 across the United States, offer a low-cost way for people with cognitive impairment and their families to socialize and cope with the challenges of memory loss. A recent report indicated that caregivers experience stress coordinating care, and memory cafes address social isolation for both patients and caregivers. The cafes distinguish themselves from other programs by including caregivers, offering mutual support through shared experiences and social interaction, potentially becoming more crucial given potential federal health funding cuts.</p>

The review is expected to highlight emerging threats, including drones and artificial intelligence, recommending the integration of digital experts with troops. Additional funding of over ¬£1.5 billion will be allocated to improve military housing, addressing urgent repairs and developing new accommodations, following a report revealing substandard living conditions for service families.</p>

The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security are jointly investigating and cleaning up "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Mock papers claiming to use AI for question prediction are being sold online at inflated prices, and some social media accounts are purporting access to "top secret" information from teachers who help set the papers.

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks, marking the end of one of the UK's most expensive and complex road upgrade projects. The ¬£2 billion upgrade aims to improve prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved constructing almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. The road had been called the "road from hell" due to the extensive delays and congestion during construction.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's initiative to sell stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice becoming available in stores, attracting eager consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to offer the rice at a reduced price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. The rice, sourced from 2021 and 2022 stockpiles, is part of an effort to alleviate the burden of rising rice prices on households. Ito-Yokado secured 5,000 tons, and Iris Ohyama secured 10,000 tons of the 2022 harvest.</p>
