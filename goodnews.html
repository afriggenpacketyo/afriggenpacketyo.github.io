          <p>SpaceX's latest Starship test flight reached space, marking progress over previous attempts that ended in explosions during ascent. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak and spun out of control, causing it to break up during re-entry into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. While several planned tests were not conducted due to the anomaly, the company appears to have resolved issues that caused earlier explosions. Elon Musk noted improvements in heat shield tile performance during ascent, with the next test flights scheduled to occur more frequently, though past schedules have proven unrealistic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees access to a sensitive Treasury Department system controlling federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas permitted four DOGE employees access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service after the Trump administration established a system to train employees to prevent improper disclosures. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which faced legal challenges from Democratic attorneys general who initially blocked DOGE's access. Vargas stated that the court would no longer act as Treasury's human resources officer for onboarding team members.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the multinational auto giant, has appointed Antonio Filosa as its new CEO, effective June 23, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa, previously North American chief operating officer and Jeep CEO, will focus on strengthening relationships with partners and balancing investments in internal combustion engines and electric vehicles. The appointment comes after Stellantis reported a downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. Filosa's priorities include mending relationships with dealers, suppliers, unions, and communities, which had been strained under Tavares' leadership.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to relinquish ownership of daguerreotypes of an enslaved man, Renty, and his daughter, Delia, to the International African American Museum in Charleston, S.C., after a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be their descendant. The images, commissioned by a Harvard professor to support discredited theories of Black racial inferiority, will be transferred along with images of five other enslaved people. Lanier sued Harvard in 2019, arguing the school profited from the images, but the case took on broader significance as universities grappled with their ties to slavery. The settlement marks a reckoning for museums holding plundered property.</p>

          <p>A federal judge affirmed that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to characterize it as temporary. A lawsuit filed by 14 states alleges that Musk and DOGE are violating the Constitution by making sweeping changes to the federal government without proper authorization. The judge found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch without known limits, and that the states made a credible argument that he "occupies a continuing position" and "exercises significant authority" without Congressional approval. The court decided that Trump could be dismissed as a defendant in the case.</p>
