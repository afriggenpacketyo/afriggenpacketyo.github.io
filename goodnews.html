          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government stepped in to halt a strike by 10,000 flight attendants that had stranded over 100,000 travelers. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the union and the airline into binding arbitration, citing the need to protect the economy and supply chains. While the airline plans to restore its schedule over the next week, the union has criticized the government's intervention as a violation of workers' rights. The core of the dispute remains unresolved, with flight attendants seeking higher pay and compensation for on-the-ground work, which they argue the airline's latest offer failed to adequately address.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the historic building in 2017 for £555,000 and spent nearly five years and a significant sum overcoming immense logistical challenges, including installing running water and electricity. Originally built in the 1850s to defend against French naval attacks, the fort is now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub, ready for a new owner to define its future as a private retreat or tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but continues to churn over the ocean with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. While the storm is not currently forecast to impact the U.S. mainland, a tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Heavy rain and swells are expected to affect Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as the storm moves west-northwest. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was dramatically rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong current pushed him off his lines and behind the cascade. After an extensive search involving aircraft and a drone that located him, a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family, concluding what the sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>Within the span of a single undergraduate cohort's time in college, generative AI tools like ChatGPT have become an integral and widespread part of student life. The article argues that students now routinely use AI not just to cheat, but pragmatically, to manage heavy workloads and focus on what they deem more valuable activities. This rapid adoption has created a new reality on campus, yet many faculty members have been slow to adapt their teaching and assessment methods. As the technology becomes a daily habit, higher education faces a fundamental challenge to redefine learning and academic integrity in the AI era.</p>

          <p>A unique program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas is facilitating emotional reunions by helping elderly parents obtain temporary U.S. visas to visit their undocumented children. Many of these families have been separated for decades, unable to see each other due to immigration barriers. The article highlights the story of one man who had not seen his parents in nearly 25 years since he left for California. While the program brings immense joy, the number of visas approved by the U.S. remains limited, leaving many other families still waiting for their chance to reconnect.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Explores How New Film 'Materialists' Reflects the Transactional Nature of Modern Dating</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 05:00:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new film by Celine Song, "Materialists," is being discussed as a truthful reflection of the modern dating landscape, where romance is increasingly intertwined with financial pragmatism. The movie's protagonist, a matchmaker, treats relationships like a market, appraising clients' value to find a suitable match. The commentary argues this mirrors reality, where dating apps have fostered a consumerist logic and economic pressures have made a partner's financial stability a critical consideration for many. This has led to what sociologist Eva Illouz calls "emotional capitalism," where romantic decisions follow the logic of economic exchange, blurring the lines between love and financial security.</p>

          <p>Australia has officially granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong. Hui fled the city in 2020 after being charged with multiple offenses related to his involvement in the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was later targeted by a police bounty. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for providing protection for him and his family. While thankful, he also described the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown and urged Australia to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, has returned to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years after defeating Argentina 41-24 in their Rugby Championship opener. The All Blacks established a strong lead in the first half, but had to withstand a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas. Two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho ultimately sealed the victory for New Zealand in Cordoba. The win, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, was enough to propel the All Blacks back to the number one spot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores how a person's perception of art, particularly Renaissance masterpieces, can evolve dramatically with life experience. The author recounts her own journey from being a cynical student who found such art unrelatable to someone who, after experiencing trauma and motherhood, found profound emotional resonance in the works of artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. The piece connects the timeless themes of motherhood, grief, and love in these historical works to contemporary art, such as a Jenny Saville exhibition, and to the shared human condition, suggesting that an openness to art reflects an openness to life.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the undercover operation that led to the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man responsible for the infamous "canal murders" in Phoenix in the early 1990s. In 2015, a cold case detective met with Miller, a person of interest, at a Chili's restaurant under the pretext of a casual conversation. The real purpose was to covertly collect his DNA from a water glass. The sample was a perfect match to DNA found on the victims, leading to the arrest and eventual death penalty conviction of Miller, who was known locally for dressing as a character called the "Zombie Hunter."</p>
