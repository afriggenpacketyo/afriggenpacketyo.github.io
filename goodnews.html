The network stated the initial decision was made to avoid inflaming a tense situation, but after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel, they decided to bring the show back. The suspension had followed pressure from major station owners and the FCC, sparking a nationwide debate over free speech and corporate responses to political pressure.</p>

          <p>India is making a significant $18.2 billion investment to establish itself as a global player in the semiconductor industry through its ambitious "Semiconductor Mission." The goal is to build a complete domestic supply chain, from chip design to fabrication and packaging, thereby reducing its reliance on imports. This strategic move aims to capture a share of the global electronics market that is currently shifting away from China, though experts caution that India faces steep competition and must overcome significant infrastructural and policy hurdles.

The proposal is a direct response to recent biomedical research funding cuts by the Trump administration in the United States.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted several stocks within the S&P 500 that he believes are attractively priced for investment, even as the broader market reaches new highs. His list includes companies across various sectors, such as T-Mobile in telecommunications, Royal Caribbean in travel, Caterpillar in industrials, and Citigroup in finance. Cramer's thesis is that diligent investors can still find companies offering faster-than-average growth at a lower-than-average price, presenting opportunities in the current economic environment.

          <p>The National Health Service in England has introduced a new patient safety initiative called "Jess's Rule," which urges general practitioners to urgently reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three separate visits. The rule is named in memory of Jessica Brady, who died from advanced cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as less serious over more than 20 contacts with her GP. The guidance aims to prevent avoidable deaths by prompting earlier specialist referrals and second opinions.</p>
