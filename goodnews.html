          <h2>China Agrees to Begin Resuming Japanese Seafood Imports Following Fukushima Wastewater Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 00:48:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's government announced that China has agreed to start procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which had been banned after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue seeking the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. While Japanese fishermen welcomed the announcement, it may take a few months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks. The agreement covers businesses allowed to export to China before the wastewater discharge, and China found no abnormal radioactive substance concentrations near the Fukushima plant. The new agreement could be a significant step towards resolving other bilateral issues between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, improving on his runner-up finish from the previous year. He won by correctly spelling the word "eclaircissement" after outlasting eight other spellers in the final rounds. The competition came down to Faizan, Sarv Dharavane, and Sarvadnya Kadam, with Faizan ultimately securing the victory after his competitors misspelled their words. He became the fifth runner-up to come back and win the competition, marking the first time this has happened since 2001. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual competition where students from across the U.S. compete by spelling increasingly difficult words.</p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures, according to Defense Minister Gen Nakatani. Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters, and defense equipment purchases should be based on national security needs. His remarks followed comments from Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggesting that defense equipment purchases could help reduce the trade deficit. Nakatani is scheduled to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to discuss security issues.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, and a sled dog tourism company provided helicopter support to reach the remote location. Rescuers used airbags and brute force to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a hospital. He credits his survival to luck, his wife's quick thinking, and the assistance of the rescuers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Elon Musk is finishing his official role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but hinted at continued collaboration. Musk's government service is ending due to the legal limit for his "special government employee" designation, but Trump stated Musk will "always be with us, helping all the way." Musk thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending, with DOGE reporting $175 billion in savings through various measures. Despite criticism from Democrats, Musk's return to the private sector has been welcomed by markets.</p>
