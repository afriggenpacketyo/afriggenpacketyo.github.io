Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the condition as benign and common for his age, stating it was discovered after he noted mild leg swelling. The bruising on his hand was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, with the White House emphasizing that the president remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a shareholder lawsuit connected to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The class-action lawsuit claimed that company officials had failed to fully disclose the risks of user data being misused and had violated a 2012 FTC consent order by sharing personal data without consent. The settlement was reached just as a trial was beginning, averting further court proceedings for the executives.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County following allegations that its Peacock streaming service made it excessively difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions.

          <p>It is possible for individuals on Social Security to consolidate debt, although a fixed income can present challenges in qualifying for traditional loans with favorable terms. The article outlines several strategies, including home equity loans or lines of credit for those with sufficient home equity and good credit. For others, a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can lower interest rates, while options like debt settlement or direct negotiation with creditors are also viable alternatives.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is considering changes to its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. This potential policy shift follows the recent elimination of the requirement for travelers to remove their shoes during standard security checks. Noem stated she is questioning "everything TSA does" as part of a broader effort to streamline airport screening processes while maintaining security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that children under the age of seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks due to the health risks of an ingredient they contain. The chemical, glycerol, is used to create the slushy texture but can cause side effects like headaches, sickness, and even loss of consciousness in young children if consumed in large amounts. The FSA also recommended limiting consumption for children aged seven to ten.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the national voting age to 16 has sparked analysis on which political parties might benefit. While polls indicate that younger voters currently favor left-leaning parties like Labour and the Greens, experts are cautious about the overall impact. Because 16 and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the total population and younger demographics typically have lower election turnout, any effect on national results is expected to be negligible.</p>
