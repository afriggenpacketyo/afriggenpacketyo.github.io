          <p>Apple's latest software redesign, known as Liquid Glass, which spans across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26, has been met with disappointment from mainland Chinese consumers. The hashtag "iOS26 Ugly" trended on Weibo, with over 20,000 users expressing dissatisfaction with the new interface. Some users are reconsidering upgrading their smartphones due to the perceived lack of aesthetic appeal, indicating a potential impact on Apple's adoption rate in the Chinese market. This negative reception highlights the importance of catering to regional preferences in software design.</p>

          <p>Chinese film distributors have pledged to increase the import of foreign films to diversify the country's cinematic offerings, especially as domestic productions have dominated the market. At a conference organized by the China Film Group Corporation and Huaxia Film Distribution, distributors committed to bringing in quality films from multiple countries to increase the market share of foreign films. This move aims to leverage the positive impact of imported films in expanding and diversifying the market, as foreign films have faced challenges in box office returns compared to domestic rivals this year.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, inspired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are pushing for spending cuts through a mechanism called rescissions. Rescissions involve the White House requesting cuts to already-approved funding, which Congress must then approve within 45 days. The House is voting on a proposal to cut $9.4 billion in funding to PBS, NPR, and USAID, part of a larger $180 billion sum uncovered by Musk's DOGE efforts. Republicans aim to garner support for these cuts by emphasizing the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse, despite concerns from moderate Republicans and criticism from Democrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increasing flood risks due to climate change, elevating homes is emerging as a key strategy for protecting communities, particularly in coastal areas like New Jersey. The article highlights how raising homes can safeguard them from floodwaters, allowing residents to remain in their communities. However, elevation is expensive, costing upwards of $140,000, and requires significant upfront investment, which can lead to gentrification as wealthier individuals and developers buy out those who cannot afford the upgrades. The article underscores the need for comprehensive community-level strategies, including protecting infrastructure and roadways, to effectively mitigate flood risks.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced that his government will extend winter fuel payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. This reverses a previous decision to limit the payments to only the poorest pensioners, citing an improved economy as the reason for the change. The decision follows pressure from charities, unions, and backbench MPs, and is expected to cost around ¬£1.25 billion. Critics argue the move creates unnecessary complexity, while the government insists it will not lead to permanent additional borrowing.</p>

Bull, a long-time ally of Nigel Farage, will step down from his role at TalkTV to take on the position, focusing on providing leadership to activists rather than administrative tasks. The appointment of a media figure contrasts with Yusuf's background as a businessman, and the party is restructuring leadership roles following Yusuf's departure.

          <p>A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing executive orders that restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and transgender rights in grant funding requirements. The judge ruled that the government cannot force recipients to halt DEI programs or acknowledge transgender individuals to receive funding. The order will remain in effect during the legal case, with plaintiffs arguing that the executive orders restrict free speech rights and that Congress, not the president, has the power to condition how federal funds are used. This decision is a victory for LGBTQ+ organizations and health centers that rely on federal funding to support their missions.</p>
