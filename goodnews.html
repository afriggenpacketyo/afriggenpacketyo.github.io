          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Donald Trump announced he has contacted Vladimir Putin to arrange direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. Trump stated that a trilateral summit involving himself would follow this initial meeting, calling it a "very good, early step." While Zelenskyy confirmed readiness for such a meeting, he noted no date has been set. The Kremlin's response was more cautious, acknowledging a discussion about continuing direct negotiations but not confirming a leaders' summit, highlighting the diplomatic challenges that remain.</p>

          <p>Following talks in Washington, former President Trump announced he is arranging a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit. This development came after European leaders joined the discussions, appearing to push back against Trump's suggestion that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for negotiations. Trump also hinted at providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a crucial element for any potential peace deal, though specifics remain vague. The meeting also saw President Zelenskyy adopt a more conciliatory and grateful tone compared to a previous, more acrimonious White House visit.</p>

Traders are also evaluating the recent diplomatic talks in Washington aimed at resolving the conflict in Ukraine. While Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight gain after a record close, markets in South Korea and Australia experienced modest drops. The mixed performance reflects a cautious sentiment, with investors looking for signals from Fed officials and monitoring geopolitical developments for their potential impact on the global economy.

          <p>The Type 99A main battle tank (MBT) represents a key component of China's modernized ground forces, integrating advanced technology for enhanced firepower, agility, and survivability. As the latest variant in the Type 99 series, which first entered service in 2001, the 55-tonne vehicle features an improved 125mm smoothbore main gun and a larger turret. The article notes that while much focus has been on China's naval and air force expansion, the prominence of the Type 99A underscores the continued strategic importance of advanced land-based systems in modern warfare, a lesson reinforced by recent conflicts.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that while he believes artificial intelligence is a profoundly important technology, the investment sector is currently overexcited, creating a potential bubble with "insane" valuations. He acknowledged that some investors are likely to get "very burnt" by the current froth, comparing the situation to the dot-com crash which saw many companies fail but ultimately gave rise to the modern internet. Despite these concerns, Altman affirmed OpenAI's aggressive spending on infrastructure, stating the company expects to spend trillions on datacenter construction to meet the growing demand for AI compute power.

          <p>Japanese investment giant SoftBank has announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, purchasing shares at $23 each and becoming the company's fifth-largest shareholder. This move is seen as a significant vote of confidence in Intel's turnaround strategy, particularly as the chipmaker struggles to compete in the advanced semiconductor market and establish its new manufacturing business. The investment comes amid reports that the U.S. government is also considering taking an equity stake to bolster domestic chip production and secure the nation's technology supply chain.

          <p>This analysis piece observes a marked shift in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approach during his recent White House visit compared to a contentious meeting six months prior. Dressed more formally and expressing repeated gratitude, Zelenskyy appeared to heed advice from European allies to avoid antagonizing former President Trump. This charm offensive is framed as a strategic necessity, as Ukraine's fate is heavily reliant on continued U.S. support, however fickle it may be. The article notes that despite the improved atmosphere, the fundamental disagreements on issues like a pre-negotiation ceasefire and the specifics of security guarantees remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity for a significant geographic realignment of teams into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred argued that such a move could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason matchups for broadcast partners. While the idea could face strong opposition from traditionalists, it would aim to create more regional rivalries and better broadcast time slots. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process, with Nashville and Salt Lake City as potential frontrunners, approved before his term ends in 2029.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has collected long tubes of sediment, or mud cores, from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of the Southern Ocean's history. By analyzing the distinct layers, scientists aim to understand the historical state of marine life and the impact of human activities, such as industrial whaling. A key part of the research involves environmental DNA analysis, which can reveal the genetic "fingerprint" of past life. This will help scientists calculate how much carbon was naturally stored by large whale populations before they were decimated, providing insight into their role in regulating the global climate.</p>

This delicate and complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center away from the expanding mine.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug also known as "designer Xanax." The immediate action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its sale or possession. The move came at the request of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is leading a coalition of 21 state attorneys general urging the federal DEA to issue a similar nationwide emergency ban. The unregulated drug, linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, poses a growing public health threat.</p>
