          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner with prominent tech CEOs, including Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, at the White House, celebrating them as leaders in business and innovation. Bill Gates used his speaking time to discuss vaccine advancements, contrasting with recent vaccine skepticism from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Elon Musk, though invited, did not attend, sending a representative instead, following a public falling-out with Trump earlier this year. The event highlights Trump's continued efforts to cultivate ties with tech leaders and influence industry development and investment.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally saw gains after President Trump signed an executive order reducing Japanese auto import tariffs to 15% and confirming $550 billion in Japanese investments in U.S. projects.

Several Asian chip stocks surged following Trump's comments about imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not moving production to the U.S. U.S. equity futures remained stable ahead of the August jobs report, with Wall Street also closing higher on hopes of a favorable report.

While acknowledging their consumer appeal for automating tasks, Arora emphasized the need for robust controls around credentials and enterprise security to prevent breaches. He noted that a substantial majority of breaches stem from credential theft, underscoring the importance of managing access to privileged information. Arora's company is making its largest acquisition to date, CyberArk, an identity security provider, to address these critical security challenges in the evolving digital landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to streamline regulations for the commercial space industry, promoting rapid expansion and economic growth. The order directs federal agencies, including the FAA, to expedite environmental reviews and launch permits, potentially benefiting companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Critics, including environmental law experts, question the order's legal authority to bypass established environmental protection laws. They argue that while it supports industry, it may attempt to skirt regulations designed to mitigate the environmental impact of rocket launches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Trump's policy requiring passport applicants to list their "biological sex at birth" as male or female. The policy, initiated by Trump to recognize only binary genders, reversed a Biden administration rule allowing an "X" gender marker. The court affirmed a lower judge's finding that the policy was arbitrary and rooted in "unconstitutional animus" toward transgender Americans. This decision ensures that transgender and nonbinary individuals can continue to obtain passports reflecting their gender identities, upholding their constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is reportedly collaborating with Broadcom to begin mass production of its own artificial intelligence chips in 2026, according to the Financial Times. These custom-designed chips are intended for internal use, aiming to reduce OpenAI's reliance on external suppliers like Nvidia and enhance its operational autonomy. Broadcom's CEO recently announced over $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer, aligning with this report and underscoring the growing demand. This strategic move by OpenAI follows similar efforts by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta to develop in-house AI silicon to meet surging demand for computing power.</p>
